– Mr President, let me say how delighted I am that we are finally discussing the Goldstone report in plenary, because it is a vitally important issue, and to date, the EU has been shamefully absent in these issues. It is quite unacceptable that the Council still has not endorsed the recommendations of the Goldstone report. The Commission says it is taking it very seriously, but that is not good enough: we want an explicit endorsement. The Presidency says that it backs it: well, it should back it publicly and explicitly and make sure that the rest of the Council does as well. Against that backdrop, I have to say I am pleased that in Parliament’s motion for a resolution on the Human Rights Council, which we will vote on tomorrow, we have two very strong paragraphs calling on the High Representative and on Member States to publicly demand the implementation of the report’s recommendations. The resolution further calls on them to actively monitor the implementation of the recommendations for consultation of EU external missions and with NGOs in the field, because the evidence we have so far is that neither the Israeli authorities nor Hamas are taking their responsibilities sufficiently seriously. In Israel, the investigations into targets and tactics used during Operation Cast Lead have been carried out by army commanders or military police, severely compromising the independence of the findings, and from the Hamas side there is still a failure to address adequately the firing of rockets into southern Israel. In the light of these failures, it is clear that the EU should put pressure on the UN Secretary-General to prepare a genuinely independent assessment. Finally, given the ongoing humanitarian crisis in Gaza, I call again on the Council and the High Representative to put far more pressure on Israel to lift the siege which is preventing reconstruction and exacerbating the suffering. Caroline Lucas,

– Mr President, I would like to welcome the statements from both the Council and the Commission, but my question to them both is when are we are going to go beyond the fine words – which I very much agree with – when are we going to have real action? We have heard the same words over and again that we need to ensure that Israel does this or does that, but we need the real leverage to make that happen, otherwise Israel will simply ignore us, as it continues to do. My question is what practically can you do to make sure that we see real movement and progress here? To my mind that has to involve issues like the suspension of the EU-Israel Association Agreement. Focusing on the situation in East Jerusalem, I welcome very much the Swedish Presidency’s initiative and its clarity over the role of Jerusalem as a capital of two states and your firmness about the importance of Israel freezing its settlement activity in East Jerusalem. I also pay tribute to the authors of the EU Heads of Mission report on East Jerusalem itself. That report speaks with a clarity and vision which is all too often absent in these debates. It sets out how Israel’s policy of illegal annexation of East Jerusalem is deliberately designed to weaken the Palestinian community in the city and prevent Palestinian development. But the Heads of Mission called on the Council to adopt a whole range of recommendations as a result of that report, and I believe that we need to see urgent action from the Council to do exactly that. If the EU is serious about its commitment to a two-state solution, it needs to be doing everything possible to preserve and strengthen the Palestinian character and identity of East Jerusalem. The Heads of Mission statement and report show practical ways of doing so. Caroline Lucas  (Verts/ALE

– Madam President, there is a new film on climate change called The Age of Stupid
. It is set in 2055 and focuses on a lone survivor of climate catastrophe. I am haunted by some words from that film, where the actor, looking back to 2009 – looking back to now – says ‘Why, knowing what they knew then, didn’t they act when there was still time?’ In other words, why have we failed to galvanise sufficient political will? Partly it is because we do not talk enough about the benefits of shifting to a post-carbon world – the millions of jobs in green energy, the better-insulated homes, the improved public transport. That is the message the EU must champion. Yet even the most ambitious target the EU is currently proposing – a 30% cut by 2020 – will give us only a 50/50 chance of avoiding the worst of climate change. If you were told that a plane that you were about to get on had a 50/50 chance of crashing, you probably would not get on. And yet the stakes we are playing for in Copenhagen are a lot higher than that. So my message to you is: please, be more ambitious. Do not let the epitaph for Copenhagen be that this was the Age of Stupid. Jean Lambert  (Verts/ALE

 Mr President, I trust our excitable friend is now lying down in a darkened room. I was one of those who negotiated the Return Directive. Certainly the section on detention was an extremely difficult one and I think that the results are not results which we should necessarily be proud of, but the directive is extremely clear that any detention shall only be maintained as long as removal arrangements are in progress and executed with due diligence. So that means that things have to be moving, people have to be informed of what is happening and if that is not the case they should not be in detention. The courts are clear on this, UNHCR has raised questions about the changes going on in Greece, but I think we also have some issues here in terms of the follow-up to the Stockholm Programme, in what we are doing that actually helps make returns sustainable in terms of preparation, prospects and indeed follow-up, to find out what actually does happen to people on return. We have reports – verified reports – of people tortured on return, for example to Sri Lanka and indeed other countries. I think we also need to be paying more attention to those who cannot be returned, either because of the lack of cooperation of the country of return or the situation in that country and of those who are actually stateless. We have to avoid deliberately making people destitute and potential victims of criminals who prey on the vulnerable.

 I think we have at least been able to talk to each other sensibly about these extremely difficult issues over the past. As a political group, we have problems with the readmission agreements, particularly when they are linked to questions of trade, because the readmission agreement is about individuals – human beings – and how we actually treat them. In terms of an integrated approach, I think you are right. The European Union is very good at having a sort of piecemeal approach, but it has not looked at how these approaches actually work together, either for the benefit of the individuals concerned, or indeed for that of the societies in which they are moving.

 Madam President, I would like to start by paying tribute to our rapporteur on this topic. Ria Oomen-Ruijten is very well known in this House – and indeed outside it – as a champion of the rights of cross-border workers. She will be sorely missed in Parliament in the future. I thoroughly agree with her when she talks about the need for those taking up the right to free movement not to be penalised, and to be able to maintain occupational pension rights. But we have seen the difficulties caused by long vesting periods and the implications this also has for age limits on cross-border transfer. We have also seen the irony – I remember from one all-party group meeting on pensions in this House – of the pensions expert addressing us being somebody who, because of his work patterns – two years here, three years there in particular Member States – had actually no acquired occupational pension rights whatsoever. What we have on the table here, while it is certainly not what many of us might have wished for, is nevertheless better. It is better in terms of the age dimension, the shorter vesting period and informed consent – the information that workers have to have – and certainly fairer in terms of the treatment of dormant rights. It has taken us a long time to get to this point. I think many of us would hope that we will see greater possibilities for transferability from one pension scheme to another – being able to take cash across and actually pay it into another scheme so that we avoid this kind of chopping, this fragmentation into different schemes. Nevertheless I think what we have before us is welcome, and about time too. Jean Lambert,

 Mr President, I too would like to thank the rapporteur and others who have worked on this. It is true that when we are looking at issues around unemployment, questions about quality and information coming from the administrations have a really important role in this. This has a real impact on people’s lives. We should remember that access to high-quality public services is a strong part of the active inclusion agenda, so it is right that we learn from each other’s experience and really benefit from that. I think that the involvement of all Member States is extremely important and, frankly, I find that the arguments that we have been having over this have been totally dispiriting. We have made a turf war out of something which really should be common sense, namely that we do need to be developing the experience and to be giving people a better experience, whether that is dealing – as people have mentioned – with the Youth Guarantee and youth employment or questions about long-term unemployment and also particularly in relation to vulnerable groups. I think we all believe that cooperation with relevant stakeholders will also add something to this network. That will include not only the regional and local employment offices but also organisations which, for example, represent the unemployed and vulnerable workers. So we hope that we can get over this hiccup at the start and move on to have something that is going to be very constructive. Jean Lambert  (Verts/ALE

 I abstained on the final vote as regards this report for a number of reasons. The large number of separate and split votes, conducted at speed, means there are points where the text is probably no longer coherent with itself. In order to be coherent with my own vote on the Honeyball report at the last Strasbourg session, I find it difficult to support the outcome here. While there is much to support in this report – the need for the Council to break the deadlock on the Maternity Leave Directive, an ongoing commitment to access to care for undocumented women, a repetition of the EP’S commitment to gender budgeting to name but three examples – there were other points which were rejected and mean we left out important issues. I find it difficult to believe that the EPP voted against the right of women to be mothers and workers, or that the EP rejected the need to mainstream gender equality in our work with developing countries. I believe we need to rethink how we approach these reports in the face of determined, regressive attitudes coming from a section of the EP. Women’s rights and progress can no longer be taken for granted. Jean Lambert  (Verts/ALE
). - 
 Mr President, I too would like to thank the rapporteur and the shadow rapporteurs for the work done on this. We have heard mentioned today the checks and balances which are supposed to be there in terms of oversight of security services. It has become clear yet again, for those of us who remember ECHELON, that these are not operational or are being ignored, or that they certainly need changing, to move away from deference to security agencies and the light-touch approach. We have laws in place to limit general phishing expeditions, and we know that there are real questions about the efficiency of mass information. But the relevant checks and balances are clearly not operating, and we have governments making new powers out of vague laws. This working-round: what is on-shore, what is offshore, what is foreign? ‘If I hand you this bit of information and you hand me that about our respective citizens, well, we are legally OK, but we are not actually within the spirit of the law. Another question that is raised here is the inclusion of private companies acting within the state security services. What is the protection for the workers, and what are the rules under which they operate? Finally, I really think that if we are simply looking at a nice diplomatic, cosy chat with the United States as a result of this, it makes you wonder what has to happen before we actually take some definitive action. Jean Lambert  (Verts/ALE
). - 
 Mr President, I would also like to concentrate on the Gutiérrez Prieto report. When our committee decided our position on that, we were very pleased to support the report. It emphasises the social mess that we are in because of the way the crisis has been handled. We have heard about increasing unemployment and increasing poverty. Marian Harkin spoke very movingly on that subject, and it is clear that, at the moment, it looks as if we have no hope in hell of achieving the EU 2020 goals by that date. This does not mean we should walk away from the targets, of course. We are also very pleased that the demand for an interinstitutional agreement has not been included in this report. That discontent about the lack of democracy, about the real influence of this House – as the people’s representatives – on the Annual Growth Survey and on the country-specific recommendations, is broadly felt here, and in our view a Treaty change is not needed to have this interinstitutional agreement. Our feeling is that the Commission and Council should be grabbing this with both hands. I would really like to ask their representatives here whether they are going to take action on the issue and start negotiating such an agreement or not? It is also clear that, if we want the EU 2020 process, the Semester, to have democratic legitimacy, we need to involve civil society and social partners much more strongly.  At the European level, we have seen a coalition of civil society organisations working very hard over the last few years to gain a meaningful role, and with some success.  But we need to see this embedded structurally into this whole process – at national level too. In the UK, we have seen civil society social partners really squeezed out of the process since the change from the past coordination method. We really need to feel that people are on board with this process to actually have a say and to shape it. Jean Lambert,

 Mr President, I should like to say on behalf of my group that we very much welcome the proposals in Parliament’s response on this particular issue. I think a number of us will have met or heard from students, from researchers, who have been hit by the current difficulties, who do not get a reply on time to their applications where the research grant is running out and who will then find themselves in a situation where they cannot take up the offer, which is a problem for them and their working lives. It is also a problem, of course, for the research institutes, the research bodies that thought this was the best person to come in and help their research. We also very much welcome the introduction of the cross-border element in this. We are seeing more and more research being conducted in the European Union across borders. It seems only right that those people conducting that research should also be able to move in order to make the most of the possibilities of what it is they have come to do.  We were concerned that we did not, in this proposal, go back over some of the rights which are already there, for example in terms of family reunification for researchers, and we very much welcome the extension of this to students. We are also pleased to see the increased possibilities for volunteering. I think we need to see this as part of a lifelong learning experience, an experience in terms of capacity-building and indeed in terms of learning from those coming to us for those opportunities; the greater clarity and protection for au pairs is something we also welcome in this proposal.

I sometimes wonder if people have read the report. The Third World was referred to, and I am sure the Member will know the major countries that actually supply researchers and university students to the European Union at the moment. So I am sure that Mr Brons will inform us as to which of the countries are sending the largest number of students and researchers at the moment. Jean Lambert  (Verts/ALE
). - 
 Mr President, as we have heard, my Group also welcomes the Directive and the work of the rapporteur and the negotiating team, and we thoroughly agree with what has been said about the importance of decent work. I would also like to explain to my confused UK colleague that the UK is actually not signing up to this Directive, so some of what was said simply does not apply in this case. But in terms of the important sectors of the workforce listed here, one of which is agriculture, we go to a lot of effort to produce food in the European Union and we are rightly concerned about food waste, yet we have seen a situation where it can be left to rot in the fields because we cannot get a local workforce necessary to complete the harvest. That applies even in some Member States with high unemployment rates and high regional rates. As people have said, there is a long-standing concern here about the conditions for workers in seasonal work, whether EU nationals or third-country nationals. The risk of exploitation, the lack of effective inspection and redress and, at times, an unclear migration status are also a barrier to protection. This gives that clear set of social rights – including accommodation, which has been a major issue and where we have seen people expected to live in horrendous conditions and then charged effectively the whole of their income for it. Like others, we would like to have seen more within this Directive, but we think it is important for the possibilities and the protection it offers. We look forward to its full and effective implementation. Jean Lambert  (Verts/ALE
). -  
Mr President, I am very pleased that we have been talking about many of the rules this afternoon, because I think that, for a number of us in our Member States, the way in which this debate is conducted is as if there are no rules and no regulations. People turn up, and from day one – hallelujah! – the money is showered upon you and you do not have to anything for it. This is a total load of lies and an absolute misrepresentation, but of course it suits some to have a fact-free zone, because facts can be very uncomfortable. Yes, there is evidence that there are problems. Looking at the citizenship reports from the European Union that the Commission has produced, we know that there is a lack of information for people when they move about how things work, what their entitlements are and how they actually fit into systems. We know there is a lack of information about rights, such as rights at work. These are the sort of things that allow the exploitation of people. This is why we discussed labour inspection this week, partly as a direct response to some of the issues that have arisen through people moving within the European Union. We should deal with those difficulties, and we should also deal with the gaps that there are in protection. But the principle is clear. If you move, there is equal treatment with the nationals of the state that you are in. This means that if you are contributing, you have entitlements. And I am really concerned about some of the actions calling into question the entitlements of people who have contributed to a system, so that they are actually going to get nothing for something – the opposite of what is often said.

Mr President, we would very much like to thank the rapporteur, Kinga Göncz, on the rights, equalities and citizenship dossier for the very close cooperation we enjoyed from our committee. For us, one of the issues that we wanted to raise was certainly in terms of anti-discrimination. We know that we have the legislation on the statute books – much of it directly, of course, relevant to employment – but we know that in the world of work itself there is still a lot of work to be done in terms of a real understanding of what equalities mean: for those whom we are serving, but also for our colleagues.  Certainly in terms, for example, of disability we know that at the moment it is virtually impossible for people with disabilities to really be fairly treated in the workplace. So that was a major issue for us. Also in terms of data protection: how that will affect people in the workplace directly was of course an area of concern. But I was also working on this for my political group and there I think that, given that it is International Human Rights Day, talking about this programme is extremely important. We welcome it but, as people have said, it is modest; it is in many respects a small programme which is having to deal with very big tasks. We know too that hate speech is on the increase, whether that is against people with disabilities, or people of a different skin colour or background or sexual orientation.  So we really want to see some work done on that. We know that a lot of the national organisations which exist under the current legislation are seeing their budgets dramatically cut. We know that Equinet too is important in this role and therefore we really want to see some work done on promotion and delivery on very strong issues of anti-discrimination. As has been said, this also encompasses the old Daphne programme and again organisations are seeing their support cut at the moment but domestic violence is increasing at a time of crisis. So we want to be able to continue the ground-breaking work that we have seen in a number of places from organisations working on these issues.  Childrenʼs rights, of course, come in as a newer dimension. We know from other work we have done in this Parliament about the difficulties, for example, in providing real legal guardianship for children within the European Union. So we can see that this programme might well also be able to help deliver something very positive for our children. Jean Lambert  (Verts/ALE

I voted against both of the alternative motions to this report. I find it deeply hypocritical that we are willing to engage in supporting these vital services to those in other parts of the world but are not willing to consider their role in our own Member States. There was much lobbying on the original report and much of that lobbying was either ill-informed or deliberately misleading and sensationalist. This Parliament has, rightly, spent time legislating to protect children and young people from abuse, but they need to know how to protect themselves and that is why sex education is important. No one has been advocating abortion as a form of contraception – indeed, it is often a failure of contraception which raises the issue. However, we know from years of experience that the availability of safe abortion is better than the backstreet alternative. No one in this House has advocated compulsory termination of pregnancy, yet those of us who wished to support the original Committee on Women’s Rights report have been accused of that. I believe the success of the EPP/ECR motion is a retrograde step for this House – hence my vote against their motion. Jean Lambert  (Verts/ALE

I voted against this report, which contains many good proposals, as Amendment 62 on Article 9 was narrowly defeated. This concerned the banning of trawling and gillnets below a depth of 600 metres, thus protecting deep-sea species. Deep-sea environments are increasingly ecologically fragile: things happen slowly there due to the cold and lack of light, yet they are ecologically diverse. Disruption of that environment means it takes a long time to recover – just as high-mountain environments take a long time to recover when they are damaged. Deep-sea trawling trashes the environment necessary for ecological diversity, creating long-term damage for a short-term return. This House has missed a valuable opportunity to further help the marine environment (which is increasingly under threat from climate change) by deferring a decision to stop deep-sea trawling. Hence my decision to vote against this report. Jean Lambert,

Mr President, as others have said, the 2008 elections in Bangladesh saw real progress. The concern many of us have here is that the next election should not go back on what was a very positive election, where all parties could actually accept the results. There are issues about the interim arrangements. On our last delegation visit there – I chair that delegation – we made it very clear that we felt that interim measures had to be put in place well in advance and agreed well in advance, and of course that has not happened. This is part of the problem that we are now seeing, with parties that did not originally like the caretaker government now wanting it, and those that did like it originally now having overseen its removal from the constitution. We are talking about the confidence of all parties in an interim measure. The problem, of course, is that there is no confidence between the leaders of the two main parties. This is why the people of Bangladesh find themselves in a difficult position. We would all agree that we want to see as wide a choice as possible in those next elections. That is what the people of Bangladesh want. That is what they deserve. There is a vibrant civil society in Bangladesh. We are really concerned at the moment that what we are seeing is a bit of a clampdown on some of those who dare to criticise some of the things happening there. We would call, therefore, for those who are currently being charged to be released and to be allowed back into civil society. Jean Lambert  (Verts/ALE

Mr President, people have spoken about their areas. London, which I represent, is home to one million EU nationals, and many will tell you that one of the problems is a lack of awareness of rights, not people abusing them. Also, free movement is one of the most popular rights of the European Union, which may explain why certain people are so busy attacking it at the moment. I wanted to say a couple of words about coordination of social security, given that I worked on that for 10 years in this Parliament. It is about the same rights as nationals; it is about the same qualifying periods as nationals; it has been the practice for years – possibly the sixth piece of legislation ever put in place by the European Union – and the current rules were passed by unanimity in Council. We have heard a lot about why people move. It is not just about salaries, when they take that into account – it is also the cost of living. So do not assume that a higher salary automatically means that people get a better quality of life if they choose to move. Jean Lambert,

Mr President, I am speaking also as a trustee of Solidarity Network in the UK and chair of the Delegation for South Asia, which covers a number of the countries concerned.  I obviously want to support what my colleagues have said about the need to oppose caste-based, descent-based discrimination and that no-one should have to change their faith to be accepted in society, no-one should be refused water in a disaster because of their caste and everyone should be able to benefit from education and use their talents. Particularly, in the week when we celebrate International Day of the Girl Child, I think this has a particular relevance for the Dalits. We have seen recent legislation in Nepal which has challenged discrimination. We have seen EU projects there which have made an enormous difference but, as people have said, unless this is taken up and becomes part of a real cultural shift, all we are doing is supporting some people. This is extremely valuable and shows what it is we are trying to do, but we need to have these rights entrenched, not just in the Constitution, but in implementation in the law. We also need to look at our own Member States. The UK has recently brought caste discrimination into its anti-discrimination legislation, but we are seeing deliberate moves by a particular Home Office minister to prevent the implementation of that change. So this is something we need to be aware of in our own countries, as well as in the values that we promote internationally. Jean Lambert  (Verts/ALE

I voted in favour of the final report, although I have many reservations. However, we need to improve the current situation. This report provides the bare minimum: we voted to include Indirect Land Use Change (ILUC) factors reflecting the climate impact due to displacement of food production of different feedstocks on greenhouse gas accounting from 2020, and adopted a cap of 6 % on land-based biofuels including energy crops as a safeguard for 2020. My Group opposed the 10 % biofuels target when it was first proposed, but found no majority in the EP. We have now seen the damage that the current target is doing in terms of removing land for food production and transferring its use to fuel production. I deeply regret the attitude of some Members, who have sought to weaken the Commission’s proposal and who now seek to delay agreement with a view to weakening Parliament’s position and doing in negotiations what they could not do in the vote.

– I voted against this report. Not a single proposal from the Committee on Employment and Social Affairs was taken on board: there is nothing that seems to imply that the Services Directive has done anything that might be negative. ‘Only open up our markets and jobs and prosperity will follow’ seems to be its message. This House would not even confirm its previous position, enshrined in the Directive, to preserve the exclusion of welfare services from its scope. Overriding reasons of general interest must be available to local authorities if they are to be able to develop their local economy. I also deeply resent being told that if I vote against this Directive, I am voting against jobs – especially when the report contains no analysis of the effect of the Directive on job loss or job quality. There is much we can do to create employment but a blind faith in opening up markets and further competition does not amount to a job creation strategy. Jean Lambert,

Mr President, I want to start by warmly thanking colleagues from the different political groups who have worked on this report with me in an extremely constructive atmosphere. I also want to thank the many individuals and organisations – whether professional associations, non-governmental organisations or voluntary bodies – that have provided their direct experience and evidence about what is happening on the ground at the moment in our Member States to those who are particularly vulnerable. We have tried to reflect their voices in this report and provide some ways forward. We take as our starting point the declaration that all human beings are born free, with equal dignity and equal rights, and we believe that it is the responsibility of Member States to promote and guarantee those rights. We are also saying that the fundamental values of the European Union should be respected even in a crisis situation, and access to care, healthcare and social assistance should be seen as a basic right for all within the European Union. We know that times are hard in many countries, but we have also heard how political choices are making things harder. We have heard much in this Parliament about the dire situation of young people without employment. Yet some Member States stop health insurance after a certain period of time out of work. It is the European Year of Citizens, yet some Member States are making it more difficult for EU nationals to access healthcare to which they are entitled. The EU has a Roma strategy, yet we still have many examples of prejudice affecting access to healthcare despite the existing EU legislation. The Parliament welcomed the Commission recommendation on children and the recognition of the need to invest in early years to enhance life chances, yet we are seeing an increasing number of children taken into care linked to family poverty, and others going without basic vaccinations. Rising costs, falling income and cuts in services make it difficult to maintain the preventative services to which our governments have signed up, and we are storing up longer-term problems. We heard about those providing and receiving care: many of them informal carers, many becoming a vulnerable group in themselves. People with disabilities told us that not only are some places going back to old models of institutional care rather than supporting independent living, but the levels of hate crime against people with disabilities are rising as they are increasingly viewed as burdens. They are not the only groups now experiencing harassment or even violence. So the list of problems is long, but we also try to look at some solutions. Some are straightforward, such as the provision of accurate and understandable information. Tackling discrimination and extending the legal framework at EU level would also be seen as useful. But we have also called for Member States to carry out social impact assessments on austerity measures and to address the shortfalls. The Commission and Member States, in cooperation with all relevant stakeholders, and that means vulnerable people themselves, should monitor and address – that is the active part in national reform plans – which policies run counter to the EU’s 2020 poverty reduction targets. We want the Commission to include social safeguards protecting care and social services and social protection systems in agreements with countries in receipt of financial assistance. Many of us find it incredible that that has not already been done. We want to see support for carers and are asking the Commission to bring forward proposals for a carers’ leave directive. A social dialogue for the care sector could also help raise standards for the workforce. There are many other proposals in our report and I am sure we will hear those in the debate this morning. Once again, I thank colleagues for their very active input and support in this important issue. Jean Lambert,  
rapporteur

Madam President, my thanks to colleagues who have taken part in today’s discussion. I think we have a great deal of consensus here. I just want to reiterate certain of the points, such as the issue of the social impact assessment of cuts that have been made. I think this is coming through as something which people feel is extremely important. I know that it was said that it was almost as if we were demanding of Member States that they do additional homework that we should not be asking them to do. Well, in my earlier life I was a teacher, so maybe I am used to asking people to do homework, but it is also the fact that our Member States have signed up and made a number of commitments.  It was pointed out that they signed up to the UN Convention on the Rights of People with Disabilities. That carries certain responsibilities and implications with it but, even in terms of the national reform plans, there are certain things there which our Member States have agreed to do and agreed to share, and therefore the issue – whether it is about benchmarking, impact assessment or whatever – is about taking account of what they are doing and looking at how they are going to deal with the effects of that in terms of the anti-poverty targets, in terms also, as many have stressed, of the issues of human dignity and indeed what we consider to be solidarity within the European Union and acceptable standards, which I think is extremely important. The issue about the growing inequalities is also something that I think we should really be concerned about. We are well aware of what the adverse impacts of health inequalities are for people’s life chances. There is a lot I think that can be done, even if you are not looking at particularly radical reform: at least close the gaps in systems that allow people to fall through them and lose their right to access care – people who were maybe working on temporary contracts or whatever and who therefore do not actually gain the health benefits that they might otherwise have done in full-term contracts. There are things that can be done to reduce the gaps, to reduce the barriers in terms of access to care.  A lot of points have been made, as well, about the role of carers themselves. It is true – we have heard the figures from all of our Member States about what it actually saves public services when people are caring on an informal basis – but that does need to be recognised. People should not be asked to give up their opportunities to work – their own work-life balance, as it were – to provide that ongoing service without some form of recognition. Recognition within the pension system was mentioned, but it is also extremely important in terms of the support and the care of carers.  There is more that can be done as well, we believe, in terms of actually improving the quality, the decent work side, of those who are providing care on a paid basis. Given the future demands that we have seen, we need to address that very rapidly. Yes, there is money there from the Cohesion Fund, not as much as many of us would have liked, but again that was a political choice made by our national governments, and indeed some in Parliament, but we ought to make sure that this money is spent effectively and to the maximum. Thank you again for the debate and we look forward to the follow-up action on this. Jean Lambert  (Verts/ALE

Mr President, I have a couple of questions, but firstly I would like to make it absolutely clear that it is scandalous that we even have to look at having a food distribution programme in the European Union and that people are living in poverty and, secondly, that if we are going to, I certainly would support such a Fund. However, I would like some clarification. If each country is expected to participate but does not use the allocated money, what happens to that money as foreseen under this proposal? Is it reallocated within the Fund or does it go back to the general budget?  Secondly, in some accounts of the allocation that I have seen, the UK and Germany, for example, could do very well out of this Fund in terms of getting significant amounts of money and other countries, some of whom have been dependent on this Fund, such as Spain and Portugal, would actually have a lower allocation of monies as a result of Germany and the UK, etc. getting so much. Is that correct?  Thirdly, does one presume, given that this financing is coming from the European Social Fund envelope, that if countries are taking money for the Food Aid Fund from that envelope, they will have less to use from the Social Fund for other things?

 Mr President, we did manage to get in something positive about gender identity and the Qualifications Directive. In terms of the common European asylum system, we are not there yet. Certainly with this latest round of recasts we have seen the limits of the recast system. Many of us feel we fought for every bit of progress that we have managed to get in this package, against a number of Member States that certainly did not want to move.  We can see that we do not yet have a common system if you look at what is happening with one and a half million refugees from Syria, a relatively small number of them in the European Union. Yet when you see the examination of their claims, some countries appear to be doing the job properly, others are not and virtually all claims are being rejected. One of the things that this Parliament, and certainly my Group, wanted was the genuine examination of every claim. We wanted to see high standards of human rights, we wanted to see a higher standard of consistency across Member States, not the lottery that Ms Guillaume has referred to, and we wanted to see the respect of the dignity of individuals, not treating people as criminals and automatically locking them up in closed centres simply because they dared to claim asylum.  So what progress do we have against those benchmarks? My colleagues will speak of Eurodac and procedures. It is true that on Dublin we have made quite a bit of progress compared to the current Dublin II Regulation. A number of the concerns raised in the latest report from a Jesuit refugee service will be addressed, and the recent Court case will be really important. We do not want children left at airports because they have not been picked up by people from the social services of the country to which they are being returned again.  On reception, my judgment would be that we have made marginal progress and that a number of safeguards in terms of levels of support, and indeed safeguards in terms related to detention, really do not take us very far forward. I am sorry to say that. Jean Lambert,

 Mr President, while we broadly welcome the social investment package we felt that much of it was very ‘soft’, and almost a reworking of a number of things which we have heard before. Obviously, we are pleased that we are looking at social investment and the importance of an economic stabiliser being recognised as part of our social protection system. But the issue of adequacy, I think, is still one that many of us are really concerned about. We are seeing more people in poverty now than ever, and we also seem to be losing track of any idea of actually trying to create greater equality in our societies by reducing the gap between rich and poor, not simply looking at how we raise those at the bottom.  The quality of public services is important, obviously, and there is a real area for investment there, including in jobs. But I also want to say something about the recommendation on children. Many people are very worried about demographics in the European Union, and here we have a recommendation which is a very strong one in terms of the focus on early intervention.  We are concerned about nutrition globally, in terms of poverty reduction measures and making the best of children’s futures, and we are seeing a growing need for emergency food aid here. We are seeing vaccination programmes here under threat. We know what happens to children’s life chances if they are in poor housing. The high-quality child care model set out in the Barcelona targets seems to be really mouldering. So where do we really see the action coming on this, not just the policy? What can we expect from the Member States in terms of a range of ministers really working with the economic ministers who seem to be totally in charge of things at the moment?

It is equality within states and between Member States. If you look at some of the impact there at the moment from various social systems, you can see that there are Member States within which there is a greater equality – both newer and older Member States.  It is as much to do with the systems and the values that you put in place as anything else. Therefore the issue of making sure that you have a level of social security which means that people are not left in poverty becomes absolutely crucial. It is not only about older and newer. There are lessons to be learned from, say, the Czech Republic just as there are from Sweden or Denmark. Jean Lambert,

Madam President, I am also speaking in my capacity as Chair of the Delegation for relations with South Asia, which covers Bangladesh. In that capacity, I have also issued a statement of condolence to the families of those tragically killed. A few days ago, Bangladesh moved over 1 million people out of danger from an approaching cyclone. There we saw 13 deaths, mainly people hit by trees, and loss of property. Why am I mentioning this? Well, because I think that it shows what can be done to reduce disasters and risks when government and civil society work together with international help. We need the same determined attitude to risk reduction in the textiles sector, and I could add shipbreaking as well. In the textiles sector we have over 4 million people, mainly women, who ought to be able to feel that they can return home safely after the end of a working day having earned a decent living wage. That has implications – as others have mentioned – for the prices actually paid by the buyers. These recent tragedies have no doubt raised the issue’s profile, and they have certainly raised political pressure. We are seeing a concerted response at the moment, and I am really pleased that the ILO is in there and that the European Union is also offering its support. The accord on fire and building safety, which brings together the trade unions, NGOs, government and the textile retailers, is important. I do not think that we should step back from naming companies who have yet to sign up. That public pressure is really important and, as my colleague has said, it is the coordinated holistic response, not a series of parallel inspections, that is really needed. Equally, some of the other measures that we have talked about, in terms of corporate social responsibility, need to be enforced. So my group will not be supporting the amendments to write these issues out of this resolution. The action plan is certainly to be welcomed. That strengthened role for trade unions, I think we would all agree, is extremely important within this, as is their ability to organise freely and to hold management to account. Management responsibility in Rana Plaza was desperately lacking. Bringing in additional inspectors who have to be able to do their job properly without interference is also important. We would also echo that GSP should be an incentive: yes, there are obviously consequences if you don’t move forward on it, but let us start with the incentive first and across all countries. This is something we should also be considering in the India Free Trade Agreement, as India also has a big textile sector that needs attention. Jean Lambert,

Mr President, I am speaking both in my capacity as Chair of the delegation for South Asia and as a Group member. The European Parliament has supported the need for war crimes trials in Bangladesh, given the atrocities committed during the liberation war 40 years ago and the shadows still cast over the country by those events. Commitment to hold such trials was part of the Awami League manifesto in the last general election, the result of which was widely accepted, and that party is now in government. Many of us have mixed feelings in relation to the issue. We recognise the need for the trials, but deplore that the death penalty is still on the statute books. We understand the political dimension of the trials, but believe it is essential for the courts to be fully in control and that political interference from any quarter is unacceptable and must be resisted for the outcome to be trusted. We understand the desire of Bangladesh to deal with its past, but that should not mean that such trials fall below national and international standards, and there is cause for concern at present. Recent changes to the rules on appeal are particularly worrying. We recognise that public passions will run high but, as the war crimes trials themselves bear witness, there has been enough death, violence and intimidation. It is an absolute tragedy to see the numbers of recent dead, targeting of minorities, hacking to death of law enforcement officers and the use of live ammunition against civilians. So we call on all sides and all those in positions of power and influence to call a halt to the violence. Jean Lambert,

Mr President, I too would like to thank the rapporteur for the good cooperation on this report. I can agree with her introductory remarks and, indeed, those of the Commission and most of the others we have heard this evening, though not quite all.  Her report is important because it recognises that integration is an active policy. It also recognises migrants as individuals, with different needs and, therefore, different programmes that need to work for those individuals if they are going to contribute to our societies and we are also going to contribute to their lives; we do not want people leaving the European Union at any stage having lost skills, having their talents under-used, or indeed not having their lives developed.  In that respect, it is also very important, in terms of the workplace being a key point of integration, to make sure that our anti-discrimination measures are working, that equality of treatment applies and indeed that we have in place a social security system that actually recognises those contributions once people have left the European Union. Jean Lambert,

Mr President, I very much welcome the opportunity to address these questions to the Commission. We are well aware in this Parliament of unemployment across the European Union, but of course young people with disabilities are likely to have the greatest difficulty of all in getting their first job in any sector, even the new ones. So the accessibility proposal mentioned by the Commissioner would be welcome, but we would also like to see a really strong and active implementation of the anti-discrimination directives already on the statute books. Cuts – as we know – are reducing the possibility for independence and social inclusion, even in those countries which have been most progressive. Indeed, as my colleague Marian Harkin has said, there is mounting evidence that people with disabilities face growing hostility in a number of Member States. A recent poll by the UK charity Scope showed that two-thirds of respondents had recently experienced hostility – up by 40% in just four months. This is being stoked by parts of the press, even quality papers like The Telegraph

 Mr President, I also speak in my capacity as Chair of the delegation of the European Parliament which covers Bangladesh, among other countries. Along with others from my group, we would like to express our condolences to the families of those who have died in fires and other accidents in various textile factories and elsewhere. It is an issue, as we have said, which spreads beyond Bangladesh, even though that is our primary focus today. We are well aware that squeezed profit margins do not only lead to pressure on wages but can also lead to shortcuts in safety, and we are concerned that many of the major companies who had contracts with the Tazreen factory did not want to acknowledge that at the time of the tragedy, even though the building had recently passed an evaluation by one of those major contractors. We also welcome the response from the governments in Pakistan and Bangladesh in terms of compensation and commitment to the victims and their families, and we welcome the contribution that has been made by some overseas companies as well; we only wish there were more of them. My colleague has just referred to the outcome of the tripartite meeting yesterday: the ILO, the government, the employers and workers should be seen as positive in terms of commitment to act, to abide by the existing laws, regulations and procedures, and to see that those are properly implemented and that there are consequences if that does not happen. That is a clear responsibility: government. It is also important, in our view, that there are active trade unions and labour rights’ activists such as Aminul Islam, who was recently murdered. It is essential to this process, as our history has shown, to have active trade unions on the ground working with health and safety committees and able to blow the whistle on employers who do not live up to their obligations. But those who have contracts there also have a crucial role in improving standards, and we regret that certain companies – Walmart is one that has been mentioned in the press – have been less than forthcoming and active in that role. As consumers we should be confident that the clothes we wear have not put someone’s life at risk wherever they work, and I welcome what has been done by our delegation in Bangladesh and in other countries to improve labour standards and make sure that everybody is safe at work.

Mr President, we have seen that it is not so easy to stand up against forces like the Taliban when one personally, one’s family and those close to one are actually being threatened, and indeed murdered. We in this Parliament commend Malala’s bravery and that of Hina Khan and countless others – those girls, and boys, who attend education even when they are under threat. There has been political and public outcry in Pakistan over this tragic event, and we should be supporting that outcry. The women’s caucus in the parliament has been instrumental in changing the laws in Pakistan. The problem will now be the implementation, because for some, like the Taliban, education is a threat to the power structure. We have seen almost 1 000 attacks on schools in that area of Pakistan, so we know it is crucially important for the government to invest in universal education and an open curriculum. We should be supporting it in every way we can to stand up against the forces of oppression. Jean Lambert  (Verts/ALE

 I abstained on this vote. There are significant monies to be paid for commitments made over this financial period which are now being requested – and a number of them are late. As the EU cannot carry over monies unspent from previous years, we have been unable to build up any provision for these requests. However, Member States have had those unspent monies returned to their national budgets, where they can carry forward unspent monies: they are now unwilling to restore that money to the EU budget in order to meet commitments made – ironically, largely to Member States. I doubt if they will be willing to forgo those payments and will thus still expect payment. The monies owed are larger than the additional amount requested by Commission and Parliament. I was also angered during the vote by the hypocrisy of some Members who, while arguing for a reduced budget, then voted for additional and continuing funding for the ITER project which is, in my opinion, a waste of Union resources. We also failed to have a qualified majority to end export and tobacco subsidies, when we could find money by ending such damaging projects. Jean Lambert,

. – Mr President, my thanks as well to the rapporteur, not least for trying to push through a wider vision of what the European Year of Citizens should be about, rather than just focusing on the rights to free movement. These rights do need to be better understood. We know that they are crucially important and that for many citizens they are seen as the key indicator of equality within an EU setting, along with coordination of social security rights – maybe this is why certain governments and parties feel that to help make the European Union less acceptable they have to call those rights into question at the moment. As our rapporteur says, the EU needs to be able to answer the bigger questions about what role citizens are playing in decision-making in the European Union. The current crisis certainly makes many feel that they are on the receiving end of decisions made elsewhere, and that decisions are being made to suit unaccountable markets rather than individuals and families living with the consequences. Maybe one of the outcomes we should be looking at for this European Year is to have a real citizens’ charter. Jean Lambert  (Verts/ALE

 I supported the Rapporteur today in his proposal to reject ACTA. The Greens have been an integral part of the campaign to raise awareness of the problems we see within this Treaty, for individual rights and the protection of some of those most in need. Concerns about the draconian and disproportionate penalties linked to copyright infringement in the proposed Treaty are well-known. I am deeply concerned that governments and the Commission have put themselves in the position where ACTA is the subject of an ECJ ruling concerning its compatibility with Fundamental Human Rights. I am also concerned at the potential problems arising for generic medicines – essential for improved healthcare for some of the world’s poorest people. I look forward to future Treaties being given the same rigorous scrutiny as ACTA has received. Jean Lambert  (Verts/ALE

 I regret that the alternative motion for a resolution was not passed as it contained strong guarantees in relation to cloning and transport times for live animals. However, I supported the resolution which was eventually passed as it is a positive step forward. The EU urgently needs to address the effective implementation of existing legislation, not least with regard to the Zoos Directive, and Member States need to increase their rate and standard of inspection in relation animal welfare. It seems that many of my colleagues believe that high welfare standards reduce competitiveness: it is true that those producers who cut costs by cutting standards are a problem: they need to be tackled by making sure rules are kept, where they exist. But we also need to address the rules of international trade, so that methods of production can be made explicit and also used to ban low-welfare imports. Jean Lambert  (Verts/ALE

 I welcome today’s resolution on basic bank accounts, and the Commission’s response during the debate, as being important steps towards greater social inclusion. An estimated 30 million European citizens do not have a bank account and approximately 7 million have been refused access to one. While some may choose not to be within the banking system (and, given current events, who can be surprised at their decision?), many others do not have a choice. They then find it difficult to take out contracts for housing or other essential services, and may find themselves paying higher prices for domestic utilities as companies effectively charge a premium for what they view as ‘high-risk’ groups: the poorest are often hit hardest. I look forward to the Commission’s proposal on legislation later this year. Jean Lambert  (Verts/ALE

Madam President, I think that some of this debate is profoundly depressing when we are talking about how to keep the European Union out of human rights provisions. This is about accession to the European Convention, the European Court, rights for all within the European Union. It closes the gap which is there at the moment and which leaves EU legislation and actions outside the European Court of Human Rights. So the purpose of the Convention, the purpose of the Court, is that it requires governments to meet certain standards – just as many of us want it to require the EU to meet certain standards and to call governments and other authorities to account. Now there may be judgments from the European Court that we do not like. There are some that I am not too happy about. But the whole point is that it is not a pick-and-mix. You do not simply take those judgments that you like and put them into practice, while with others you simply say: I did not like the judges who made that. If you do not like the judges, argue for the reform and training of the judges, and then when you are making those arguments, also remember that a lot of court findings are against countries such as Russia and Ukraine, the very places we have heard complaints about. This is about the rule of law, within a human rights context; about how governments and other authorities respond to being held to account. That is something I want to see brought in for the European Union, not left outside. (The speaker agreed to take a blue-card question under Rule 149(8)) Jean Lambert  (Verts/ALE

– Mr President, I, too, would like to thank the rapporteur for the work that has been done on this. As has been said, it is a highly technical document, but it is an extremely important one for individuals within the European Union. As people have said, this is the latest update of what is – in many ways – one of the earliest pieces of legislation put in place by the European Union. It has been extensively revised – a job that we finished in 2009 – and this is now the update. Very soon, we will be seeing how the new electronic system that underpins this is coming into effect, and hopefully it will be able to deal with citizens’ concerns more rapidly. This concerns the maintenance of rights for people who move across borders for whatever reason or who work in border areas. It deals with the areas of core social security, health care, unemployment, pensions, family benefits, etc. It is extremely important that those rights are upheld. I think we have got quite a citizen-friendly outcome from this first reading agreement. As we have been saying, it is designed to uphold the rights of individuals who are covered by social security systems. It was not put in place to provide an opportunity for businesses – particularly those with mobile workers – to cut costs by providing them with an opportunity to choose the cheapest place to register their workers for social security purposes. I am very pleased that we have actually managed to close that particular loophole within this revision, because to find yourself registered in a country where you feel you have no connection and to seek health care treatment, for example, in the country where you are resident, is bound to lead to confusion and a lot of difficulties for the individual. Even though the company concerned may feel that it is doing a good deal for itself and its shareholders, it is not playing fair by its workers. So we are very pleased to have got the ‘home base’ definition in there, bringing it into line with other legislation to make it very clear to individuals exactly where it is that they are registered and therefore what rights they can expect. I think we have achieved a very good outcome, and we are very pleased to see it going through at first reading. Jean Lambert  (Verts/ALE

 Mr President, I very much welcome the opportunity, at long last, to have a debate on Nigeria. It is a major country, as we have heard, which is extremely important in the region and potentially internationally. I very much regret that the only way we seem to be able to discuss events in Nigeria is via yet another resolution which has taken religion as its focus. I want to respond to some of what has been said today. Let us be clear here that, while Boko Haram is the major force behind the violence, they are not killing only Christians. Muslims have died too. They have also assassinated Muslims who do not agree with them. However, there have also been Muslim deaths where Christians – or so-called Christians – have retaliated. We have also seen these events being condemned by political and faith leaders from a variety of different perspectives. It is very important to remember what has been said about what links this country, and not just what divides it. Yes, corruption is an issue. There is more that we could be doing. I, for one, very much welcome the recent trial in British courts of Ibori, a former governor of Delta State, which put him in jail. There is more that our own countries can do to deal with corruption. The people of Nigeria want a government that is fit for purpose. That is why, as we have heard, they were willing to stand for hours in the sun waiting to vote. However, I believe that the European Union, too, needs to change its relationship with Nigeria and that this Parliament should be strengthening its relationships with the Nigerian Parliament. Jean Lambert  (Verts/ALE

– Mr President, we know that this is a difficult debate. It was difficult the first time round. Indeed, at that time, some of us who were in the House felt that the directive that we are currently discussing was too flexible and we launched a case before the ECJ concerning a couple of the provisions of the directive. Unfortunately, from the point of view of some of us, the ECJ found in the wrong way, but nevertheless it upheld two of the issues, not least about children joining their families. So while there are those who argue that this directive is unnecessarily lax, I think that we can see within the directive how we look differently at issues of flexibility. At present, four Member States covered by the directive are using it in a more and more restrictive manner, despite the rulings of the European Court of Justice. I think that is an issue that the Commission needs to look at. As someone said, the whole goal of this directive was in favour of family reunification as a measure of integration. Integration measures were meant to be part of the goal, not a barrier to family reunification. We know about people being asked to take language courses abroad when those courses do not exist and we know about highly restrictive costs in terms of coming to join family members. All of these measures are put in place to actually erect barriers. I believe, and my group believes, that those certainly need to be challenged. We are also hearing a great deal about issues of marriage and whether marriages are genuine or not. This is, of course, incredibly difficult to determine, not least when you look at the divorce rates of some EU nationals. But, nevertheless, there are ways in which we can deal with this. Some Member States already have legislation in place on issues relating to forced marriage, rather than arranged marriage. The EU has programmes in third countries looking at the empowerment of young women and girls and indeed trying to change family attitudes on the issue. There are also measures that you can take at interview stage to try to establish whether it is a forced marriage or not. I am really interested that people are so concerned about this because a number of us in this House want to bring forward measures looking at the question of forced marriage. We look forward to support from some unusual sources in terms of women’s rights on this. There is flexibility in the directive. We know that. As I say, we have seen ECJ rulings that have tried to put a limit on certain parts of the flexibility, but I think that, rather than looking to open up the directive, we need to ask the Commission what it has been doing in terms of infringement proceedings. In 2008, they said this directive was inadequately transposed and inadequately implemented in a number of Member States. What has happened since to improve that situation? Jean Lambert  (Verts/ALE

 I have voted for this resolution, not because I am enamoured of the content of the so-called six-pack (I voted against much of it) or because the euro is the way forward for all – it is not. I am supporting it because I want decision making on matters of direct interest to the EU to be taken within a clear legal framework and on a clear legal basis. I regret the British Government’s refusal to support concerted EU action and thus assist a push towards this new arrangement. An intergovernmental agreement can inhabit a grey zone, out of clear parliamentary oversight. We need clear parliamentary oversight: from both the EP and national parliaments, and this resolution states that clearly. The proposed intergovernmental agreement also sees governments stepping back from decisions made a few weeks ago, and this does not increase confidence or legal certainty. As the resolution clearly states, we need investment, not just austerity. We need a change of direction – towards a different future, based on reducing the gap between rich and poor and on new investment to help us work within environmental limits. The intergovernmental agreement is a distraction and provides no real solutions. Jean Lambert,

 Mr President, I think it is clear that for all of us the legislation that we are talking about this evening maybe is not the most perfect that we would have hoped for. However I think many of us see it as a positive step forward, and certainly analysis of it that has been done says that it may be positive in terms of integration for the many thousands of people affected by the legislation. It is a simplification in terms of putting together the residence and work permit as a single piece of paperwork. That, we know, was controversial, as well in the way in which it was discussed. But it should be a simplification and, as has been pointed out, there is a due requirement of time so that these applications should not be left sitting on desks as they so often are in many of our Member States. In terms of the rights section of it – which the Committee on Employment and Social Affairs was largely dealing with – I think we have made some progress there. The most important part of it is that we are looking at equality of treatment with Member State nationals in a large number of places, not least in terms of pay, rights of freedom of association and the right to educational/vocational training so that people are actually able to improve their skills base, which is for their own benefit and for the benefit of the company with which they work. The social security dimension is also important and I think that the changes that Parliament managed to make on pensions is one which we should be proud of. Jean Lambert  (Verts/ALE

 Mr Batten, my understanding is that the UK is not actually signing up to this, so I do not quite understand what you said. Why do you assume that people are going to be flooding to a country which is not actually covered by this directive? Jean Lambert  (Verts/ALE

– Madam President, I, too, would like to thank the rapporteur for this extremely comprehensive report, which I think should be compulsory reading for every Finance Minister. As my colleague, Ms Harkin, has just been saying, what we are seeing at the moment is a disconnect between macro-economic policy and the effect that it actually has on people’s lives on the ground. I want to respond to one or two points made by other colleagues this morning – it is a pity they are not still here. The bailouts are not charity. They are about solidarity, and they come with interest rates attached. The ESF itself is about solidarity, and that is why many of us in this House would like to see an increase in the monies going to other countries to help them combat poverty. In terms of the root causes of poverty, I for one do not believe that it is about a lack of opportunity. In some Member States where, for example, every job vacancy is being pursued by at least five unemployed people – before you even begin to look at skills mismatches and geographical mismatches – I think it is a little bit difficult to say that we are going to cut the benefits of people who have not found a job when those jobs are not there. Investment in social protection, as this report makes very clear, makes sound economic sense. It is an economic stabiliser; it helps recovery; it reduces future costs where we have to pick up the pieces of people whose health has deteriorated and whose educational opportunities have been lost; and it keeps the local economy moving. But I also want to see a reduction in the gap between rich and poor. That is what the ‘Occupy’ movement is about – the power of the 1% as against the other 99% – and that is why issues about a living wage and adequate income are essential in this debate.

 Mr President, my group would also like to thank the rapporteur and the shadows for the good cooperation in difficult negotiations. Whilst we certainly welcome the offence of online grooming being created, I must admit we found the attitude of Council in not wanting to incorporate grooming in all senses into this on the grounds that it already exists in national legislation a little surprising, given that many of the other offences here also exist in national legislation. My group, too, welcomes the inclusion for the first time in EU legislation of sex tourism related to children and the jurisdiction over nationals travelling for the purposes of child abuse, but we also agree with the Commission that it is a pity that we have not been able to find a solution on those enjoying habitual residence. We also welcome the recognition of the need to deal with the associated advertising and facilitation of such travel. We, too, welcome the measures to deal with the exclusion of convicted offenders from employment involving direct and regular contact with children. We welcome the move to make it possible for employers to request information about the potential employees for professional or organised voluntary activities with children, according to national law. Article 25 relating to websites was particularly difficult to negotiate, as has already been said, and obviously the priority must
 be to protect children. However, there are legitimate concerns that measures employed for this crucial purpose become co-opted for other purposes of state control. The solution reached in this directive is important and has the full support of my group. We also welcome support for survivors knowing the tragic consequences that such abuse has for so many children throughout their lives. Finally, we welcome the recognition, too, of the difference for consensual sexual activity between young people, whom we do not want to criminalise for behaviour that may be foolish but which is certainly not exploitative.

At EU level, it is this directive which sets out the standards for qualification for international protection: for those classic refugees who have a well-founded fear of persecution – such as many of those who dared to oppose Colonel Gadaffi and thus qualified for refugee status; and for those at risk of serious harm – perhaps a teenage girl facing the death penalty in Iran for having sexual intercourse outside marriage, who could then perhaps qualify for subsidiary protection. As well as setting out such criteria, the directive deals with the content of such protection, such as access to healthcare or education. The revision of the directive is limited; it is a recast. The Committee on Civil Liberties, Justice and Home Affairs would like to have dealt with such issues as ‘actors of protection’, where the majority of us believe this should only be the state. That is why we have cited Article 7 as one we think should be looked at in the next review, as should the definition of ‘family members’. I also wish to put on record my own concern at the lack of change in Article 10(1)(d), where the cumulative definition of a social group was maintained by the Commission rather than being offered as an alternative. I trust, at least, that the ten Member States operating in the optional perspective will continue to do so. However, some progress has been made. The definition of a social group which could suffer persecution must now include due consideration of gender-related aspects. We have also included a reference to legal tradition and customs in Recital 30. We also include sexual orientation and, for the first time, gender identity. We should not expect people to deny their identity throughout their lifetime in the hope that this will make them safe from persecution. As concerns children – the topic of the last debate – Recital 18 lays down some principles, though not an exhaustive list, to help in determining the best interests of the child. This principle is also linked to entitlement to benefits. In Article 31 we have sought to improve the tracing of family for unaccompanied minors, across the asylum process. With regard to the content of protection, we have tried to ensure the same treatment for all beneficiaries of international protection and have achieved this in many areas, notably in terms of recognition of qualifications and access to employment. People want to contribute to the country that is providing protection. However, a few Member States have insisted on being able to maintain certain differences between the two groups. This seems to be based on the misapprehension that those at risk of serious harm will need protection for a shorter period of time than those at risk of serious persecution. Our fight – maybe I should say our debate – over the length of residence permits yielded a small victory. However, we would invite the Member States most concerned in relation to difference of treatment to reflect as to whether an annual consideration of status is a good use of public money, and whether it reduces administrative burdens or provides a better context for integration than a period of at least three years. After all, there is a possibility of using cessation provisions if a need for protection changes. To conclude, this revised directive takes small, but important, steps towards a common European asylum policy, but the system is only as common as the consistent high quality of its implementation across all participating Member States. We hope that movement on this directive will help provide impetus for the remaining measures and show that progress is possible. Jean Lambert,  
rapporteur.

 Mr President, I would like to thank all who have participated in the debate today. It is true that we have difficulties with our asylum system; we know that the results can be very different from country to country, and we are also aware that this one step forward is not going to solve all the problems – although we know that it will give greater clarity in certain areas and hopefully provide a stronger base for Member States to build on the good practice which exists in some and to share that with the others. We have heard a number of regrets. Well, we all have a few but, then again, maybe not too few to mention on this occasion. Certainly in terms of the correlation tables: yes, we would like to have seen those. We would have liked to see Member States being very clear about their implementation but, on the other hand, what I think we are more interested at this point is actually moving forward in terms of the content and the common asylum system. I think it says a lot that the rapporteurs from the other asylum dossiers have all been present tonight at this debate, and many have spoken. The willingness of Parliament to move forward is extremely clear, because this is a team effort. I thank people for their warm words, but this is a team effort and involves compromise and solidarity amongst us in Parliament to try and move things in Council. As we have heard, we hope that the movement on this directive – and I hope that groups will be voting in favour of it tomorrow (and maybe one or two groups might like to reconsider their abstentions) – will help provide impetus for the remaining measures and show that progress is possible, and that quality and consistency build confidence among the Member States and the public and deliver sound humanitarian protection for those in need. I think that is what we need to have at the front of our minds when we are looking at this asylum package. Jean Lambert,  
rapporteur for the opinion of the Committee on Employment and Social Affairs

 Madam President, let us hope that, when we come to review this directive, we can do it on a different legal basis. Our committee took the view that the legal basis should be Article 153 of the Treaty, as this matter directly concerns health and safety. We also underlined the importance of providing information and genuine consultation with workers concerning the safety case and safety assessments, not only of sites dealing with spent fuel and radioactive waste, but also as regards how these should be transported, and the need for a rigorous and effective inspection regime with sanctions that are effective, dissuasive and proportionate. We also want to see that all licence holders ensure thorough and ongoing training of all involved in dealing with these substances, including subcontractors – potentially a weak link in the safety chain – casual workers and all others working on site, whatever their job. We also took the view that there was no easy divide between civil and military waste, given that civilians may well handle military waste these days. Jean Lambert,  
on behalf of the Verts/ALE Group. 
– Madam President, I, too, would like to congratulate Ms Berès for taking the initiative on this oral question and resolution. I would also like to thank the Commissioner for his answer. It is all too rare that we get a very specific response from Commissioners to questions in an oral question. My group very much welcomes the proposal from the ILO for the Convention and the recommendation on domestic workers. We are aware that at least 20 of our own Member States have already commented on the draft and been actively involved in this. We look forward to early ratification by those Member States and, indeed, some interesting implementation. People have talked very much about how this group of workers is particularly vulnerable. A lot of the work is done behind closed doors; it is invisible. Often, the workers themselves are isolated, and access to trade unions is often very difficult in this situation. Quite often, if you are taken on as a live-in employee, you can be seen as being on call 24/7. We know in this House that on-call working is a very controversial issue and something that we do not particularly welcome. As has been said, domestic work is often undervalued, or seen as traditional women’s work that ‘anybody can do’, but we have also made the point that a lot of it is actually quite skilled. It can quite often involve nursing care and various aspects of child development. Domestic workers often occupy a real position of trust. While many employers value that, there are only too many who do not. For example, in the UK we have seen a recent case of somebody actually ending up with a prison sentence on a charge of trafficking for domestic servitude. The young woman involved lost four years of her life to her employer, who received a nine-month sentence. So we need to look at how we identify that form of trafficking. Migrant female workers are very vulnerable indeed. We have come across cases, for example, of workers entering the country with diplomats and having their passport taken away; people in that situation have virtually no freedom, have no access to assistance and do not know about their rights. I want to raise one issue concerning Article 17 in the proposed Convention, which is about the role of agencies. I think this is something that we really should be looking at at European level because, increasingly, it is being seen as a weak link in many of the issues that we are facing. Jean Lambert  (Verts/ALE
).  
– Mr President, I speak as Chair of the delegation which covers Pakistan, and I must say that some real crocodile tears have been shed here tonight by people expressing views which are about 180 degrees away from those they normally express. When we have discussed this issue here in the past, we have been assured by the Commission that the items in question have been carefully assessed to ensure they do not clash with EU exports. Has this changed? We have been asked: why textiles from Pakistan? The answer is: because textiles are a major export for them. You cannot expect them to conjure up something within a few months. We, too, had our doubts about the potential effect of this measure in the flood-stricken areas. We raised this matter when we were in Pakistan, and we heard directly from Members of Parliament there that the measure would be of benefit to industry in their constituencies, so I really think that we should consider the message we send if we do not support this measure. Jean Lambert,  
on behalf of the Verts/ALE Group. 
– Madam President, I am very pleased that the Commissioner reminded us that the overwhelming amount of movement in the region has been in North Africa itself. The UNHCR estimates that over 400 000 people have already left Libya. That is something that, having listened to the debate on the Procedures Directive earlier, some of our Members would do well to remember: the majority of people are moving within North Africa. We very much welcome the support given to the UNHCR and other bodies in assisting those displaced. A lot of concern, however, has been voiced at the pressure on Malta and Lampedusa, and quite rightly. It is significant, but not equivalent to what is happening in Tunisia and Egypt. However, there is growing concern about what is happening to minors – unaccompanied or separated at arrival. There is concern that they are not being properly supported or identified. We hope that the Commission will look at their situation and at the situation of those others considered particularly vulnerable at this point. We also welcome the willingness to consider using the Temporary Protection Directive. Could the Commissioner please outline what criteria she will be using in making that assessment as to whether to bring forward a recommendation? Jean Lambert,  
author. 
– Mr President, I think all of us have been very deeply shocked and appalled by the assassination of Minister Shahbaz Bhatti, not least because he is someone known to us in this Parliament: he has visited here, he has met many of us; but also because this is another highly symbolic killing, striking at someone who was looking for reconciliation and work across all minorities in Pakistan. We should also add our condolences not only to his family, but also to all the families of those who have been killed in terrorist attacks in Pakistan. This week, we have seen two such attacks, which have killed and injured more people than, for example, the London bombings. The whole population is suffering, and intimidation is undermining democracy in Pakistan. We are seeing a change in the demographics of certain constituencies, for example, Quetta, as intimidation works to force people out. Our resolution is important in terms of wanting to continue and support the work, in terms of tolerance and mutual understanding. I would like to make the point that we need that in the European Union, too, where certain recent ministerial statements, in my view, have not helped that. So we expect leadership in Pakistan and in the European Union. Jean Lambert,  
on behalf of the Verts/ALE Group. 
– Madam President, I, too, would like to add my voice to that of others who thanked our rapporteur for the very good work that has been done on this report. We are all aware there are national differences, as well as differences within our own political groups, and to come up with anything that gains a significant level of support is quite something. My group is especially pleased that the report before us recognises the importance of first-pillar pensions, the commitment to an adequate level, the issue of being able to provide a decent life. After all, we spent all of last year, 2010, dealing with questions of poverty. And, of course, this is also, for many people, a fixed income, an essential guarantee. Like others, we also welcome the recognition that we need to tackle decent pension provision here for women. We also recognise the importance of tackling discrimination against older workers and using other measures to help people stay in work. For us, too, the portability of pension rights is a crucial issue. More and more people are not working for one company throughout their working life. Indeed, they are working for several, and not always in the same country. And we need to avoid this fragmentation of pension provision, so there is an essential role for the European Union there. We are also pleased to see that this report contains a commitment for second-pillar provision, that it should be available without discrimination on grounds of age, gender and work contract. We would agree as well – and are pleased to see it there – that we need to be adopting more of a life course approach that deals with the different rhythms and patterns of modern working lives, both positive and negative. And again we recognise the importance of solidarity in that first pillar, not least for those whose working lives are involved with more casual labour, short-term contracts and so on. We are concerned at any effort to push third-pillar private pension provision and we agree that it is crucial that people have adequate and clear information. We would also welcome the fact that this report contains – if there is going to be a change in pension provision – adequate time for adaptation for people to reconsider their financial futures. Jean Lambert,

 – Mr President, I think all of us would want to express our condolences to the family and friends of Salmaan Taseer, the Governor of Punjab put in place by the government of Pakistan, and we are remembering here today his clear support for Asia Bibi – a position he knew to be controversial and indeed dangerous. We are rightly distressed by his murder and the reaction to it by part of the population of Pakistan, but we should not forget, as well, that many have mourned him and have done that in public as a public act. It is an act we should be commending, like, for example, the action taken by the media regulator against certain media with regard to their coverage of the alleged murderer. However, as we know, the blasphemy law in Pakistan puts the lives of Pakistani citizens at risk: Muslim, Christian and others alike, as many speakers have said this afternoon. We are aware that Pakistan is a new democracy, that it is facing conflict on its borders, and that it has faced the disaster of the recent flood, as well as the earthquake only this week. We know that the government is struggling, but we also recognise that it needs our support in terms of developing democracy within Pakistan, not least in the political battle against extremism and for universal human rights, and it is our role as democratic parliamentarians to support all those who are working for positive change and to give them the voice that others would deny them. We are also asking for action by the government of Pakistan, not least to remove the reservations on the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights – which they ratified with a large number of reservations – and we urged this in our recent delegation visit to Pakistan. We want them, as well, to continue the efforts to change the blasphemy law because this is a law that is more abused than properly used. Jean Lambert,  
on behalf of the Verts/ALE Group. 
– Mr President, many in this House will remember that at first reading, this was an extremely hot topic, and I think we are hearing only some of the differences between us. There were concerns about whether market forces would win out over services of general interest; and that people who were concerned about patients’ rights to choose, and to travel, were being pitted against those who were asking which patients would actually exercise that choice. I think what we have, at the end of the day, is a reasonable compromise. As people have pointed out, in cases where things are medically necessary, with a need for urgent treatment, we already have a system in place under social security coordination. This directive is more concerned with the market system, with choice, and with people’s ability to choose where to go, and to have money follow them. So we have clarity now, in that Member States can put in place systems to enable them to ensure that needs can be met. This directive should also be welcomed because it deals with issues around the legal dimension and legal certainty: with where responsibility for follow-up treatment lies; with the question of redress if there are problems; and with issues around ensuring that procedures are carried out by qualified medical professionals. On the issue of rare diseases, we have also achieved a compromise that is better than what we were pursuing first time round. As people have said, for many patients, this will work well, but we also need to take care of our patients in our own Member States. Jean Lambert,  
on behalf of the Verts/ALE Group. 
– Madam President, we, too, have a concern about the variable labour market that we already have across 27 Member States and within those 27 Member States, but our concern is how we move away from this towards something which is more comprehensive and stronger. We want to be sure that we have an agreed basis of rights for the majority of third-country nationals, as originally set out by the Commission and generally improved in the Committee on Employment and Social Affairs. We do not want to see these rights increasingly restrained and constrained, so we will support the widest possible and strongest range of rights in tomorrow’s vote. We want to remind the Council that we are concerned here with individuals who should be able to develop their skills and education, benefit from the social security contributions they make and look forward to claiming their pension entitlements, given, as is recognised in the proposal, that their work supports our economies and indeed our societies. For our group, the commitment to circular migration is also important in Article 11(a). The scope is a vexed issue because we have other existing instruments under discussion which, at times, come into tension. We are also fooling ourselves if we think that what is on the table here is actually going to meet the needs of each and every migrant worker within the European Union. We need a more nuanced approach to ensure that migration works for them, so we are not going to be voting, for example, to include beneficiaries of humanitarian protection. Jean Lambert  (Verts/ALE
).  
– Madam President, I just want to respond to some of the comments which have been made. What Pakistan is trying to do at this point is actually to help itself out of the mess that it is in after the devastating floods. If the factories were in flood-hit areas, they would not be able to produce, so it is not surprising that the factories concerned are not in flood-hit areas. The direct aid that could be put in is miniscule compared to what the need actually is. Distribution of the income from the additional exports is important – we know that for infrastructure, for energy supplies, for schools, for roads, etc. – while there are indeed responsibilities that lie with the democratically elected government of Pakistan in terms of its effectiveness, of income, of tax revenue and so on. People have also talked about the need for greater diversity. If Pakistan had a greater diversity of industrial sectors, we would not be concentrating so much on textiles. I appeal to Members to offer that country this opportunity to help itself out of this disaster. Jean Lambert  (Verts/ALE
).  
– Madam President, I think we are all aware of the importance of minimum income schemes across the European Union, although not all Member States have them in place yet. We also know that there are very big variations in effectiveness, that there is often no clear basis for the amounts that are paid, and that the amounts paid do not necessarily keep pace with rising costs. Some Member States have a very poor take-up, so people are not getting their entitlements, and some also time-limit these income schemes, which seems very bizarre for something that is meant to be a safety net. I believe very strongly that we need a common framework across the European Union that gives clear principles for how we develop these schemes and a clear methodology for working on them. We are not talking about the same level of payment in each Member State and to keep saying this is to perpetuate something which is deeply untrue. We do need to develop these schemes so that everybody in the EU can live in dignity. Jean Lambert,  
on behalf of the Verts/ALE Group. 
– Madam President, as has been said, what is happening in Pakistan at the moment is a real tragedy and will require long-term commitment on behalf of the people of Pakistan and its democratically-elected government for some time to come. I very much welcome the Commissioner’s response, and indeed her longer-term perspective, not least the link to climate resilience. I share the concerns she has voiced about long-term funding for such disasters. I think we would all urge the international community to intensify its response. We would certainly like to welcome India’s increased contribution to the UN fund, because that sends an important political signal. In our view, the international community could go further. It could release more of Pakistan’s own money by taking action to relieve Pakistan’s international debt, much of which was incurred under military regimes. In 2008, Pakistan spent USD 3 billion on debt repayment: this dwarfs the international aid effort. France and Germany are important bilateral donors. I think we should look with some concern at the repayment terms that may be on offer for the loans that are currently being put forward. I would also like to mention that I think it is important to have a similar response from within Pakistan, not least from rich landowners who could, for example, offer some sort of rent relief for poor tenant farmers who are not going to be able to pay their rent for some time to come. Jean Lambert,  
on behalf of the Verts/ALE Group. 
– Madam President, I would very much like to thank Mrs Lynne for the opportunity for us to be debating this tonight, and I welcome a lot of what the Commissioner has said. Indeed, I found quite a lot of it quite encouraging in some ways. You will have recognised, of course, that a number of our questions concern the issues about the vulnerability of older people and a very strong feeling that we have that it is crucially important that people can feel safe with those providing care. While I take your point about the issues about what is a Member State competence, nevertheless, the open method of coordination exists to help Member States work together on something which, while it is not a competence of the European Union, nevertheless is seen as something of common importance. I think certain of the issues, even about basic care, nutrition, etc., are very important within this. I am also wondering what further steps the Commission might take to persuade Member States of the cost-effectiveness of supporting informal carers. There are certainly figures from the UK that recognise that this is a contribution of billions saved in our economy, because the care is being given by close friends or relatives rather than by the state, and that in fact, investing in something like a carer’s allowance and support mechanisms for carers really is worth doing, rather than having people totally worn out, isolated and suffering their own health and mental health problems because they have been caring for hours without background support. I am also interested in what you are saying about the possibilities of improving the qualifications of carers. Part of that issue, of course, is not only that this concerns women, it often concerns migrant women, and therefore a particular sort of investment is needed. But our resolution also talks about the need for contracts to stipulate at least a minimum income, a minimum wage. I would welcome your comments on that. Jean Lambert,  
rapporteur. 
– Mr President, I am not sure that inspiration is going to be what is on offer but this is obviously a very controversial topic that many Members in this House were terrified to come and speak about, so those of us who are brave enough to be here must seize the moment. I want to start firstly by thanking very much all the shadows who worked on this report for their very active involvement and our ability to find a common negotiating position and act as something of a team. I also want to thank the two Presidencies involved – the Czech and particularly the Swedish Presidency – for their more open attitude on this than we have seen in some negotiations, as we were able to negotiate rather than feel we were there to do what Council wanted – well, sometimes anyway. So, what did we achieve? The aim of the common European asylum support system is to deliver consistent high-quality decision making for those in need of protection, and it really can be a matter of life or death for those in need. It is well known that the system is not delivered in a consistent way across Member States. Differences at times are so great between the best and the worst that there is a lack of confidence which can lead to those who try to deliver objective decisions feeling undermined by those who do not. And those who suffer at the end of the day are those in need of protection. There is also a very strong feeling from some Member States under particular pressure that there is a lack of solidarity from others, that their need for support is not given a real practical response. Under the refugee fund, there has been a funding strand for cooperation between Member States which has led to some positive developments, but it has also become clear that there are limits to this more piecemeal approach. The Asylum Support Office is therefore being set up to provide ongoing support to enhance a consistent approach and to provide active support for countries under particular pressure. Specific tasks are already being assigned to it via other legislation. The key points for the European Parliament during the negotiations have been the role of the European Parliament itself in relation to the Asylum Support Office, how to achieve greater solidarity between the Member States, and the role of civil society and UNHCR with the Office. The issues about the role of Parliament have centred around our relationship with the Director in terms of his or her appointment and ongoing links. We have eventually settled on the European Parliament hearing the recommended candidate, offering a confidential opinion and receiving feedback on how that is being taken into account. The Director will also present the annual report to the relevant committee – I cannot quite believe we had to fight for that, but still – and we can also invite the Director to report on the performance of certain tasks. The role of Parliament in relation to agencies is now a topic for discussion in the interinstitutional working group, and I am now a member of the European Parliament team on that – partly due to my experiences and a certain sense of frustration with the negotiations on the Asylum Support Office. As regards solidarity between the Member States, Parliament wanted binding mechanisms, Council wanted to entrench the voluntary nature of cooperation, and the final language is more neutral, but we do have an external evaluation of the Asylum Support Office to look forward to, which will cover the Support Office’s impact on practical cooperation on asylum. On the role of the consultative forum, there is a lot of real expertise available to Member States, and it seemed obvious to us that such expertise could be valuable. We know that some Member States have active relationships with NGOs, and we wanted as well to make sure that local authorities, which often deliver much of what is required under the common system, also had an opportunity to be included. So we are pleased to have been able to breathe a little more life into this body. In conclusion, we feel that the Asylum Support Office could play a very valuable role in developing a common system. We hope it will be of high quality – even if we could not quite get that into the final text – and help engender a sense of mutual confidence and support. I would also ask the Member States involved to be more open to what other institutions, elected authorities and civil society can contribute, because, while this is about cooperation between Member States, it is not entirely intergovernmental. It is a European institution we are creating. Jean Lambert,  
rapporteur. 
– Mr President, I would like to just take an opportunity to clear up one or two questions which have arisen, although it is a pity that some of those asking the questions are not around for the answers. Asylum obligations are clearly set out under international conventions which all Member States have individually signed up to. That is not the same as an immigration policy, and people really should recognise the difference. For those who are concerned about the money – if I may make a party political and national political point here – if certain of our Member States stopped creating asylum seekers from Iraq and Afghanistan, I am sure we could save a lot more money and indeed save people a lot more misery. As regards some of the other points which were raised, it is hoped that improving the quality of the system in certain Member States will be able to increase confidence between Member States and deblock some of the other parts of the asylum system, as well as helping Member States feel that there is support when they are facing particular burdens. As others have pointed out, while some of our Member States do have considerable geographical pressures on them from the flows which arrive, many of the over-burdened countries are actually not in the European Union at all but are elsewhere. I was very interested to hear a colleague arguing for additional support out there, in terms of the Asylum Support Office, but I am afraid I missed the amendments which he tabled on that topic. I also want to be clear that the Asylum Support Office is not there to determine status; it is not taking over the role of Member States in that field. All in all, I welcome the kind comments made by colleagues, I welcome the active involvement of those who have helped me very much on this report, and I am sure that we are all looking forward – or most of us anyway – to being there in Valletta when the ribbon is cut on the Asylum Support Office and we can begin work. Jean Lambert,  
on behalf of the Verts/ALE Group. 
– Mr President, I would like to move an oral amendment which would become paragraph 7a (new). It is signalled on the voting list and my understanding is that it has the support of the political groups co-signing this resolution. It becomes the consequence of paragraph 7. So the new paragraph 7a would read: ‘Hence, calls once again on the Commission to develop a comprehensive European Strategy for Roma Inclusion as the instrument for combating social exclusion and discrimination of Roma in Europe’. Jean Lambert,  
on behalf of the Verts/ALE Group. 
– Mr President, I would like to echo the calls that have been made for a comprehensive strategy here. As has been pointed out, we are now in the European Year for Combating Poverty and Social Exclusion, which we know is difficult in times of recession, and that is why we have been asking for social conditionality on rescue packages so that those who are the most excluded do not find themselves falling even further behind. We have heard already that the gap is widening, which is why our EU 2020 strategy also needs to take into account the need to reduce the gaps between rich and poor. The changes in the regional development funds are important. Local authorities, we would agree with the Council, are important because that is so often where discrimination is most closely felt, on housing and the specific needs of the Roma people there, on education, and on the police whose job it is to protect and not simply to criminalise, as seems to be the way in some Member States. And we want to see high-quality public services. Council will remember its recommendation on the active inclusion of those furthest from the labour market where high-quality public services are seen as crucial. We are interested to know whether the Council and Commission are happy with the absorption rate being shown for funds at the moment. I would also welcome the context change that was strongly put out by the Commission in terms of anti-racism and xenophobia, and would hope that every Member State government would commit itself to those ideals. Jean Lambert  (Verts/ALE
).  
– Mr President, Mr Barroso talked earlier on about wanting an ambitious strategy, and it is true that there are parts of the document EU 2020 which are ambitious, but certainly the greenhouse gas emission figure is not ambitious: it is pathetic, and it is not going to get us where we want to go. We should be looking at 40% by 2020. Of course, the issue is not only about climate but also about resource availability and increasing resource efficiency. There is a lot, as well, that we seem to have seen before in this strategy, not least about economic growth coming through more and more as a goal rather than an indicator. It should not be the goal of a strategy. The EU has many areas where we have tried to decouple growth from transport, energy use, whatever, and it has long been decoupled from jobs. So, can we please not talk as if, somehow, growth is going to deliver jobs? We also need to be looking not just at reducing poverty but reducing inequalities, because that has known demonstrable benefits, and we need to make sure that our financial institutions do not undermine the ambitious goals that we might put in place. Jean Lambert,  
on behalf of the Verts/ALE Group. 
– Mr President, I too would like to thank Stephen Hughes and Liz Lynne for their work on this and indeed to welcome this action, although we would like to have seen it earlier. As has been pointed out, the USA has had legislation in place since 2001. We can now see such legislation in certain parts of the European Union, and at last we are catching up, but, of course, not before many people will already have been affected by this problem. In terms of the risk, the World Health Organisation estimates that, while 90% of exposures to this risk are in the developing world, 90% of reports about occupational infection occur in the United States and the European Union. We know that there is a major issue of under-reporting sharps injuries: estimates range between 40% and 75% and that is huge. Therefore I think we should welcome the fact that, in the social partners’ agreement, clause 11 talks about the duty to report under a no-blame culture. But I think we also need to ask why people are not reporting. Presumably part of it is that they do not understand the risks or that they fear the consequences – not least, perhaps, to their future employment – of reporting such an injury. Indeed in some places we have reports of ineffectual follow-up, in other words, even where people do report, nothing very much happens. Certainly they are not getting even the medical support that they need, let alone the emotional support – or indeed, in some cases, alternative employment, if it is considered that, when they have contracted something like HIV, there may be a risk to patients. We have research which shows that health workers working outside hospitals are more likely to be dissatisfied with the response of employers. People have spoken about the scope of this action. Of course it covers the healthcare sector, and we are very pleased that the agreement covers trainees and subcontractors. I am not entirely sure whether that includes cleaning staff, and I would welcome some clarification on that. But it does not yet cover workers in other professions at risk, so we hope Member States could look at that. The training obligations are extremely important, and I hope Member States will take this seriously: both the giving and receiving of training should be mandatory, as should induction for all new and temporary staff – because I think there is a feeling that if you train people once you never have to look at that issue again. At the moment there is a lack of training even where employers have training policies in place. An issue was raised about the cost. There are estimates that training and preventative measures, including safer devices, account for about a third of the cost of dealing with sharps injuries. That is an important saving in cash-strapped times, as well as being an important issue both for the people concerned and employers, who may indeed find themselves at risk of legal action if they are not taking action to prevent such injuries. Jean Lambert,  
on behalf of the Verts/ALE Group. 
– Madam President, I think there are certain things to be welcomed in the action plan but, as colleagues have correctly pointed out, there are a number of questions there that have not been answered. I think that, when we are looking at this, we are always looking at it from the point of view of the problem that we have and sometimes tend to underestimate the daily reality for people in both Afghanistan and Pakistan of the many deaths, the targeted killings of the Hazara population, for example, in parts of Pakistan, the attacks on girls’ schools, on the police and so many others. The Afghan police were described to us recently as basically cannon fodder for the Taliban. I think many of us are still wondering, really, what it was that we ever thought we would achieve by going in. In terms of the international response, I welcome hearing the Commissioner talking about kick-starting cooperation and particularly mentioning India. The regional approach is important, and I look forward to hearing how we are going to deal with other areas of real tension, such as Kashmir, which the Afghan Ambassador told us the other day really provides a problem for everything that people try to do in the region. We also need, in Pakistan particularly, to be looking at what effective support we are offering in terms of the many thousands of displaced people, and learn from our lack of engagement with those who were displaced to the borders of Pakistan and Afghanistan in the past that a vacuum will be filled. Therefore, we really need to be paying attention to education and meeting the needs of the population who are also looking after those displaced people. Keith Taylor  (Verts/ALE

 Mr President, I speak with a request to postpone the vote on the maritime spatial planning item, from Tuesday, to allow for an accurate translation into Swedish. I am told that the existing translation is at best opaque and at worst misleading and incorrect. I am not aware of any problems with other languages, but that is not surprising. I have spoken with Ms Meissner, the rapporteur, who is in agreement with a postponement of the vote to allow more time for an accurate translation. I am sure you will agree that this is an important point. Members must be fully aware of the details and understand properly what they are voting on. So with that, I would like to formally ask for a delay on that vote. Keith Taylor,

 Mr President, I was the shadow for the Green Group on this. There was good technical harmonisation about connections, which was very welcome. I note average results from what I basically see as a fairly flawed regulation. Member States now have reasonable freedom to decide how and where they want to have the infrastructure and an extended amount of time to decide. The bad result is the lost opportunity to tie greenhouse gas emissions and pollution emissions to the alternative fuels. It is rather technologically blind. There is no reference to renewable energies or to public transport. We need to remember that we started off by trying to reduce emissions, but that does not really seem to feature in the ambition of this report. More could have been done, but the Greens will nevertheless support it from the point of view of technical harmonisation. Keith Taylor  (Verts/ALE
). - 
 Mr President, speaking as the Green shadow rapporteur on the De Backer report, we agree that any measures to improve road safety should be seriously investigated. The terrible death toll on European roads throws down a stark challenge to reduce deaths and injuries. However, our Group is not convinced that a mandatory EU-wide eCall system as currently prescribed is the best alternative. More lives could be saved, for example, if speed limits were cut by 10 km/hour. Such a policy would also be cheaper and would achieve real casualty reductions.  We have concerns about the possibility of the EU having to co-fund the system, about data protection issues, and the increased likelihood of false alarms through the automated systems. Finally, the suggestion that the driver of the vehicle should be able to turn off the machine seems to undermine and complicate the entire idea. My Group will not be supporting either of the reports.

 Mr President, colleagues, I speak to you today as the rapporteur on last year’s report on Regulation (EU) 261/2004 and Regulation (EU) 1008/2008 and also as the Green shadow for Mr Bach’s report today. I would like to thank the rapporteur for his very constructive approach, and I am very pleased to say that we have been able to change the emphasis in the Commission proposal from one which was largely pro-industry – pro-airline – to one which is much more pro-passenger, and that is the version we will vote on today. Although my Group’s view that compensation should be paid after one hour was not carried, a compromise of three hours was, and that also mirrors the European Court of Justice’s position of three hours as the trigger. So this is considerably better than the starting point of the Commission, which was five hours. We are also able to support the narrowing of the extraordinary circumstances to stop airlines hiding behind this excuse to avoid paying compensation to travellers to whom it is due. I am pleased to see the recommendations about better communication with passengers, and I also hope that implementation can be improved. In that regard, I think that our suggestion of independent mediation bodies will prove very useful.  Also, the environmental impact and energy efficiency of passengers’ travel will be provided on the website and on the tickets for the journey. We cannot expect people to be more responsible about carbon emissions if they do not know what the effect of their activities will be.  All in all I am very pleased to be able to support this report, and I would like to thank Mr Bach once more for his constructive approach. Keith Taylor  (Verts/ALE

 I supported this own-initiative report on Blue Growth. However, I regret that the report presents the view that the marine environment is only a section for consideration within Blue Growth, instead of presenting a healthy marine ecosystem as a fundamental prerequisite within which any other sectoral ‘blue’ policies operate. This disagreement with the report is a fundamental one, but I hope this issue is better addressed in other legislative proposals (e.g. on maritime spatial planning).  Whilst amendments which called for a ban on Arctic oil and gas exploration, and for ship emission limits, were not supported in TRAN, most of the report is fine, underlining the importance of key issues for the Green/EFA group: smart, sustainable and inclusive growth, based on an eco-system approach; using the precautionary principle to assess proposals; protecting sustainable maritime sea basin strategy and developing island and coastal tourism.  The report goes on to call for the development of opportunities for ‘clean ships’ that are more energy-efficient and produce less emissions, the construction of a North Sea Offshore Grid for renewable energy, more efficient use of resources and enhanced recycling policies (as an alternative to sea mining), and notes the employment opportunities this approach presents.

 Mr President, as the Greens’ shadow on this file I would like to thank the rapporteur, Brian Simpson, for his effective work. This was a standard procedure to adopt the Maritime Labour Convention (MLC) of 2006 into EU law and in so doing to secure seafarers’ rights and protection. We are going to be supporting this first reading agreement in view of the rapporteur’s call for non-regression. That means no existing standards of social legislation should be allowed to be lowered due to the adoption of this piece of legislation. The recommendations on non-ratification did not go as far as we wanted – our proposal wanted to put ships from flag States not signing the MLC into a higher risk category but this was not accepted. We did at least get an agreement that non-flag vessels would get ‘no more favourable treatment’ than ones sailing under the convention; in Article 3 of the amended directive. Keith Taylor,

 Madam President, the existing MDG framework has helped to galvanise development efforts and guide global and national priorities. Not all the targets have been met, but we have heard some significant targets have been met and that NGOs have found it very useful to have MDGs so that they can encourage their Member State governments to achieve better results. The current MDGs do not, however, sufficiently address the root causes of poverty, such as inequalities within and among countries, as well as issues such as social exclusion, biodiversity and governance.  We need a new approach post-2015 that embraces global governance, with a strong focus on policy coherence for development and the provision of global public goods. By that I mean understanding that global public goods will include international trade, environmental and financial architecture within the context of global governance. It is also important to have a human rights approach, and I am in agreement with most of what the report says. We need a more holistic approach reflecting the outcome of the Rio+20 Conference on sustainable development, and we need to develop the concept of development effectiveness: a combination of development aid, assistance for the provision of global goods and adaptation of governance structure. It is important that the global goals and targets are tailored and adapted to national and regional contexts. In conclusion, is important to say, with regard to recipient countries, that I am very pleased to see the Commissioner is saying we should stick to the 7% GNI target for overseas development aid. Keith Taylor  (Verts/ALE

 Madam President, the question from the Chair of the Committee on Transport and Tourism is timely and I suspect there is frustration behind it. There were no fewer than three separate reports which included reference to passengers’ hand luggage adopted in 2012. I was the author of the first report which concerned the functioning and application of established rights of people travelling by air and that report was adopted by a large majority.  Concerning hand luggage, we called on the Commission to propose measures which make it possible to harmonise commercial practice so as to protect passengers against excessive restrictions and to allow them to carry on board a reasonable amount of hand luggage. We have heard the horror stories of the travelling public; the Parliament has expressed its wishes. If I heard the Commissioner right, he is going to leave it up to the market and possibly the courts. I simply do not think that is good enough and I really want the Commission to respond to those three separate reports calling for a proactive action. Keith Taylor  (Verts/ALE

 I am bitterly disappointed that Parliament voted to endorse ACAA. I do not accept the disingenuous argument of the majority of the PPE and ALDE that this was a purely technical matter. It is clearly a political one. and this vote will send out the message that the EU favours increased trade with Israel over the welfare of hundreds of thousands of Palestinians who are daily subjected to a blockade of Gaza, illegal settlements on their territories, an apartheid wall and property evictions and demolitions. Trade can be a useful tool in development and peacemaking, but voting to accept ACAA is tantamount to endorsing the ongoing violations of international humanitarian and human rights law that Israel is inflicting on the Palestinian territories and people. Through this failure to provide consistency in the application of its fundamental principles, and only weeks after the EU was awarded the Nobel Peace Prize, Parliament is undermining its own, and the EU’s, credibility as a force for good in the world. It makes no sense. I will continue to contribute to peaceful settlement in this troubled region, and strive for justice for all. Keith Taylor  (Verts/ALE

 I did not support the vote to approve Parliament’s resolution on the 2013 EU Budget. Although there were measures within the budget I did support, the overall budget’s net increase of 6.8% over the 2012 levels at a time when states all over the EU are imposing austerity measures is something I cannot condone. I have previously voted to limit additional Member State contributions to the rate of inflation, and suggest a reappraisal of spending priorities for specific budget lines with any unspent money reallocated. Such funds could also be used to meet extra commitments resulting from new post-Treaty of Lisbon measures. A favourite area for funding cuts is the billions of euros spent on the ITER nuclear fusion budget. I believe this selective approach to be a more appropriate method for directing spending in times of financial hardship, rather than approving across-the-board blanket percentage increases. Keith Taylor,  
on behalf of the Verts/ALE Group. 
– Mr President, I should like to thank Mr Kazak for his report. The Greens appreciate that the Commission has come forward with this proposal for a general regulation on MFA. We have been asking for such a regulation for the last five years and now the question arises whether this proposal is still in time. Given that Parliament is about to start the revision of the existing financial instruments for the period 2014-2020, and given the limited size and importance of the MFA instrument, we wonder whether it might not be wise to integrate the MFA into the new European Neighbourhood Instrument from 2014 onwards. This instrument already provides for budget support and could accommodate conditionality. We would only need to integrate the MFA elements when blending grants and loans into the ENI framework, but this should be possible. For Greens this would seem to be the most elegant way to signal to our neighbourhood partners that we are still willing to support their balance of payments stability while solving the problem of how to make MFA more of a true EU structural adjustment programme. We sadly did not receive the support of the other political groups over this idea. Hence we will go with the rapporteur and we will be abstaining in the vote later on.

– I am extremely pleased that this report has been adopted, as it strengthens passenger rights across the board. However, in my original draft report, I urged the Commission to propose an obligation on air carriers to provide a final guarantee covering their liabilities towards passengers in the event of insolvency, bankruptcy or removal of an operating licence. The reference to a final guarantee was weakened at the vote in the Transport and Tourism Committee, confining the proposal to support for stranded passengers to be repatriated in the event of insolvency, bankruptcy, ceased operations or removal of an operating licence. Although I welcome this measure, it is not as strong as the original wording, and I call on the Commission to look into the possibility of proposing a final guarantee to protect passengers when they revise Regulation No 261/2004.

 Mr President, as the standing rapporteur for (sound disappears
), I am particularly concerned by the situation in Kazakhstan where, as we are hearing from many other speakers, fundamental rights continue to be violated. I find it completely unacceptable that, following his recent meeting here in Strasbourg with MEPs to discuss the tragedy in Zhanaozen, Vladimir Kozlov, the leader of the opposition political party, Alga, was arrested by the Kazakh Committee of National Security on his return to the country. Mr Kozlov, as well as other political opponents of the government, was sentenced and put in prison. More recently, I have also met with some Kazakh civil society activists, including Mrs Kozlov, and I was extremely concerned to hear that Mr Kozlov has recently undergone surgery while in prison but that his current state of health is not known. Nobody, including his wife, is allowed any contact with him. Journalists I have also met have been intimidated and threatened with arrest if they write anything against the regime in Kazakhstan. So I think we should call on the Kazakh authorities to end the clampdown on the political opposition and independent media in the country and to immediately release all people incarcerated on politically motivated grounds.

 Madam President, Parliament started to draft a resolution on this, led by the Committee on Transport and Tourism, for which I am the Green shadow. We recognise that maritime piracy is an extremely complicated and problematic issue, but we also believe that it is a horizontal one, incorporating development, security and foreign affairs aspects, while the link with transport issues is more secondary. I am given to understand that the reason why the Transport Committee is the leading committee is because the Commission’s Directorate-General for Mobility and Transport wants to lead on this instead of DG Development. Greens are completely against this shift, as solutions to maritime piracy do not lie primarily with changes to transport policy. Therefore, we welcome the fact that this resolution was taken off the agenda for this plenary session. If Parliament is determined to have a resolution on this, we think it should be led by another committee such as the Subcommittee on Security and Defence, as well as being better timed in order to tie in with the external work and developments. Apart from the fact that we do not think that the Transport Committee should be leading on this issue, the solutions in the draft resolution are not in line with previous Parliament resolutions on piracy, Somalia and the Horn of Africa. Furthermore, they are too militarily based. We are against further militarisation and strongly in favour of strengthening the criminal justice approach to piracy, as advocated by the United Nations Special Advisor on Piracy, Mr Jack Lang. This, ultimately, would also need a change in any future resolution from this place on this issue. Keith Taylor,

– Mr President, the end of the death penalty has been achieved in 96 countries across the world and only 23 countries actually carried out executions in 2010. To see any reduction in the numbers of legal killings is encouraging, but hearing about the possibility that executions in Japan will restart under a new Minister of Justice is a matter of great disappointment, both for me and for my political group, the Greens, who are completely opposed to the death penalty. According to reports from Amnesty and the UN Committee on Torture, most of those people sentenced to death in Japan have given confessions under extreme duress. That duress could include physical abuse or sleep deprivation or denial of food and water and the use of a toilet and not being told of the date of their execution until the day itself arrives. But the death penalty is not fail-safe. You cannot acquit someone if they have already been killed. So I think the death penalty is abhorrent and cruel; it degrades both Japanese society and morality and it further punishes the prisoners’ families, who are innocent of any crime. So please join us in voting for a moratorium and the reactivation of the Japanese study group to stop death penalties. Keith Taylor  (Verts/ALE

 I voted for this joint resolution concerning the 8-9 December 2011 Summit as it: suggested that financial and economic consolidation could be achieved through EU law, not Intergovernmental Agreements (IA) or EU treaties; recognised the draft IA did not reflect European Parliament (EP) priorities; supported a stronger role for democratic input from the EP and welcomed inclusion of a parliamentary working group and gave all EU members (including the UK) participation rights in discussions. The draft IA is still being developed, and already there are moves from Member States to dilute the fiscal requirements identified at the December summit (including the so-called ‘golden rule’). For the Single Currency to work there needs to be strong economic and fiscal union between Eurozone (EZ) members. I am not yet convinced that the EZ states will finally agree to necessary strict controls, and I am glad the UK is not part of it. I believe it is in the UK’s best interests to have a strong and stable euro, given that 40% of our trade is with EZ countries. For that reason, and the fact it was the only option achievable at this stage, I supported the resolution. Keith Taylor,  
on behalf of the Verts/ALE Group. 
– Madam President, I would like to take this opportunity on behalf of the Green Group to thank Mr Fleckenstein and other political shadows for the very positive way in which this report developed. There was much to agree on and little to dispute, and that was because we believe that EMSA is doing a very good job. I was particularly pleased to see three elements in this report. The first was an increased role for the European Maritime Safety Agency in the monitoring of offshore oil and gas installations; the second, increased preparedness to provide a response to maritime accidents; and the third, an increase in partnership working to deliver maritime surveillance, including the SafeSeaNet programme, hopefully linking up with some of the policies recently approved in our integrated maritime policy. I did attend an EMSA conference in their new centre in Lisbon, and I must say I was very impressed with the breadth of their operations and their commitment to delivering safety on the sea. I commend this report to you and thank Mr Fleckenstein. Keith Taylor,  
on behalf of the Verts/ALE Group. 
– Mr President, the Greens on the Committee on International Trade fully support the report’s position, which is calling for Uzbekistan to take concrete and convincing measures to eradicate child labour before the Parliament can give consent to textiles being covered by the Partnership and Cooperation Agreement. I think it is perfectly right that we should be withholding European Parliament consent to this Protocol with Uzbekistan until those breaches have been stopped. In relation to the textiles, there is clear evidence of state-sanctioned, systematic and widespread forced labour in the Uzbek cotton fields. Schools are being closed during the harvest period and thousands upon thousands of school children are being forced to work in the fields collecting cotton. This is not the treatment that any child should have to tolerate. We would not tolerate it for our children. Those children in Uzbekistan are our children; we should have a responsibility for them. Keith Taylor,  
on behalf of the Verts/ALE Group.
 – Madam President, the Greens support the measures contained in the Koumoutsakos report today, and welcome the opportunity we have for an agreement at first reading. It is necessary – as has been so eloquently pointed out by other speakers – to provide some interim funding so that proper allocations can start from 2013. As it happens, we were unable to secure the amount originally envisaged, but nevertheless there is EUR 40 million available from unspent budget allocations. That money will go towards integrating maritime policy around the development of short sea shipping, the detection of illegal fishing, the integration of sea-basin strategies and maritime surveillance and, importantly, protection of the marine environment. We have particularly enjoyed working with the rapporteur. We now welcome the opportunity to work in partnership with other agencies, notably the European Maritime Safety Agency with its SafeSeaNet programme. Colleagues, please use your vote later today to support this jolly good idea. Keith Taylor  (Verts/ALE

 I did not support the vote to approve the EU Budget 2012 resolution in the EP this week. Within the budget there were measures I supported, such as increased funding for the EU 2020 work, the greening of the CAP, and for Palestine, as well as reducing business flights and freezing MEPs’ daily allowances. However, the overall budget net increase of 5.3% over 2011 levels, at a time when States all over the EU are imposing austerity measures, is something I cannot condone. I voted in June 2011 to limit increases in Member State contributions in line with inflation, and suggested specific budget lines should be revised, and unspent money reallocated. I remain of this view. Keith Taylor,

 Madam President, I rise to speak in favour of Ms Koppa’s resolution. Like many others, I have witnessed the twists and turns in the quest for Palestinian statehood in the United Nations, and like many others I wish them well and hope for a fair and just solution. In speaking today on the Koppa report it is, for me, not a question of being anti-Israel or pro-Palestine. No: it is more one of championing justice and fair play. We must hope that peace soon comes to this troubled region. I spent a few days in the Gaza Strip this summer seeing for myself the abject poverty in which Gazans have to live. I listened to the pleas of mothers and fathers unable to feed or educate their children properly, and of doctors and workers who have to work with the most basic of materials. I listened to teachers and their students, refugees and NGOs, and I heard countless stories of stalled business deals, of jobs lost through lack of raw materials, of social breakdown and the strangulation of trade by the Israeli blockade. It became very clear to me that in Gaza and in the West Bank economic recovery and social recovery go hand in hand. We have some misgivings in our Group about the nature of the agreement, the dislocation of development in social and environmental protection, and some of the practical difficulties around identifying the sources of products. The Koppa report will not solve all the problems between Israel and Palestine; but it is an important marker along the way. As the rapporteur states, opening the EU market to Palestinian products is only the first stage in the construction of a Palestinian state. I urge you to join us in the vote tomorrow in Parliament. Keith Taylor  (Verts/ALE

Madam President, I would just like to say thank you to Dieter Koch for the way we have been able to develop these road safety ideas in shadows’ meetings. Halving the casualty figures is a commendable target. As has just been said, every single death is a personal tragedy for someone. I am particularly pleased that we have managed to tackle the three major causes of accidents: alcohol, drugs and speed. We have got here a uniform blood-alcohol level for the whole EU; we have a strong recommendation for 20 mile-an-hour zones or 30 kilometre-an-hour zones in urban areas; we have got safe routes to schools; we have got measures to avoid lorry blind spots. We all have a chance to improve road safety for all road users. Please vote tomorrow to make that happen. Keith Taylor,

 Mr President, earlier in this session we heard a moving statement about the tenth anniversary of the terrible attack on the World Trade Centre. The other anniversary is that of the start of the Doha Round of negotiations towards a trade agreement. I would say that this in fact has killed millions of people – the people in the greatest poverty – or shortened their lives. I think that if we look at the responsibility for that, we see that the WTO has not fulfilled its aspirations to meet the Millennium Development Goals. It has failed the less developed countries in its belief in free trade. What we have in this resolution today is recognition that the Doha Round is dead in the water. It needs to be concluded as swiftly as possible with a package for the less developed countries. We need to concentrate on multilateral agreements because every single bilateral or plurilateral agreement tends to put trade into smaller regional or subregional blocks, and this undermines the multilateral direction which this Parliament believes is the right way to go. Furthermore, I am very pleased to see that the resolution calls for a reform of the WTO, because it is simply no longer fit for purpose. It needs to be revised around the principles of democracy and – bearing in mind that the WTO has never taken a single vote on anything, as it is all done by consensus – it needs to have transparency and accountability. Our Group believes that the wholesale enthusiasm for free trade has ultimately not delivered the promised benefits. We believe that we should be basing WTO reform around trade justice and sustainable development, which should be the watchwords as we develop a new trade body for the planet. Keith Taylor,  
on behalf of the Verts/ALE Group.

 Madam President, this motion is badly needed. Even though we have the 2006 directive, it is plain that it is not working as well as it should. The companies we have heard of exist solely to swindle unsuspecting and sometimes over-stretched organisations, and I find that particularly outrageous when they are damaging community enterprises, often with limited budgets. Using tactics like those of bully-boys and racketeers, they dangle promises in front of unsuspecting people, but I think the message has got to be that if an offer seems to be too good to be true, then most probably it is. These companies are like predatory sharks and they should be stopped. Certainly, our group welcomes this resolution, it is very timely and we will be supporting it, as it calls on the Commission to require Member States to adequately enforce the directive. Keith Taylor  (Verts/ALE

– I will be supporting an amendment in the Multiannual Financial Framework (MFF) report which limits Member State EU contributions to the rate of inflation (currently 3.2%) or below, as suggested by the Heads of State of the UK, France, Germany, Netherlands and Finland. The MMF Garriga Report seeks to increase funding from Member States for the period 2014-2020 by 5%, and this I cannot support at a time when extreme adversity is being experienced in the UK from the government’s dangerous and socially divisive austerity measures. I do support many of the measures promoted in the report and in the Green’s amendments, particularly around the Green New Deal, the end of national rebates and Own Resources for the EU, and am mindful that part of the above-inflation increase is needed to meet obligations under the Lisbon Treaty. There are, however, many expensive budget lines remaining in the MFF that shouldn’t be supported, and I’m thinking of the EUR 6.6 billion to be spent on nuclear fusion as just one example. My argument is that if there isn’t enough funding after inflation-only increases in Member State contributions, ways should be found to re-allocate budget lines to meet any shortfalls. Keith Taylor,  
on behalf of the Verts/ALE Group. 
– Madam President, as others have mentioned, Canada is indeed a solid trading partner for the EU. The abolition of the tariffs now being negotiated in the CETA framework is, on the whole, acceptable to our group. But sadly, CETA does come up with some other demands and political goals which we find deeply worrying. I will mention two of the most troublesome, the first being the negative list in the negotiations on trade liberalisation. Normally, in negotiating FTAs, you name the services that you are ready to liberalise. But under these proposals, all services are open, except those specifically excluded at the outset. As Greens, we think there are some services, particularly those dealing with the general public interest, which are too sensitive and too potentially vulnerable to be negotiated under this ‘negative list’ approach. We have lodged some amendments and we are looking forward to some support from fellow Members. The other area of concern is around procurement. We are concerned about the impact that CETA will have on procurement. To give just one example, the Ontario Green Energy Act would be illegal under CETA. That Act promotes the production and feeding of renewable energies and directs investments into local economies. That is just one example of how CETA will interfere with domestic policy in Canada. Although Canada is one of our oldest trading partners, we cannot deny that occasionally, we do have differences of opinion. Canada is, for instance, opposed to the EU’s GMO policies. It is starting WTO action against the EU import ban on seals, in addition to its barbaric annual seal cull, and do not forget that it is fighting the EU Fuel Quality Directive to protect its exports of tar sands to the EU. I believe that it is important that we voice all these concerns and urge the Commission to remain firm in the principles and policies of this place. Keith Taylor  (Verts/ALE
),

 When we first heard in October 2010 of the Commission’s plans to help Pakistan recover from its awful flooding by removing some customs tariffs, Greens were enthusiastic to help. We still are, but a once-simple idea has become over-complicated and unworkable. Originally the scheme was for 3 years, although we wanted longer to increase investor confidence. But after various business and interest groups had got involved the proposal was reduced to 12 months only – with quarterly reviews! Further, any deal needs a waiver from the World Trade Organisation, which they haven’t approved as some member countries (notably India) are worried about the effect that duty-free Pakistani textiles would have on their own markets. There has been no progress in 5 months, and it’s unlikely we’ll see any soon, if ever. In Plenary today I supported an amendment to send the whole report back to committee for re-working. In doing so I wasn’t voting against helping Pakistan, but I was recognising the report before us simply wouldn’t deliver what Pakistan needs. For me, a major stumbling block has been the WTO. I believe this organisation needs comprehensive reorganisation into a properly democratic, accountable and transparent body. Keith Taylor,  
on behalf of the Verts/ALE Group. 
– Mr President, I, like many others in this House, share the concern for, and the sympathy with, the people affected by the terrible floods in Pakistan. I did so at the time and I do now. However, when I look at how the political will has been lacking, how the corporate interests have interfered and how the WTO has procrastinated, what I see before us are recommendations that dilute the original proposals put forward at such short notice by the Commission. Mention has already been made of the short timescale for the trade preference relaxation, reduced from three years to one year: Pakistan is prevented from maintaining or increasing duties or charges within that time. Moreover, it is proposed to seek not only an annual report on a one-year programme but also quarterly reports on the application and implementation of the measures. This adds up to a huge bureaucracy being created, only to come to an end within one year. So I have a great deal of sympathy with the proposal, which is Amendment 43, to send this back to the committee so that we can come up with something which will actually deliver the help we want to give to Pakistan. Finally, I think this really does point to the acute need to look at how the WTO works and to transform it into a properly democratic body whose proceedings are transparent and whose members are accountable. Keith Taylor,  
on behalf of the Verts/ALE Group. 
– Madam President, it is quite desirable to review the trading arrangements that we have with other countries and it is quite understandable that Japan sees the FTA as particularly attractive in relation to the recent Korea FTA. There is a lot that we can support in the EPP-ALDE-ECR resolution but I think that they are making a mistake to ‘strongly support’ an FTA. That is a direct quote from paragraph 2. I think that is premature support when we do not have impact assessments on the environmental and social effects of an FTA. They are predicting the answer before identifying the effects of implementing the solution. Many people have commented about the non-tariff barriers and the work that has yet to be done by the high-level group. I think that needs a positive step forward. When we bear in mind the importance of Japan as a trading partner – with bilateral trade with the EU standing at EUR 120 billion a year, and with the EU being the number three trading partner for Japan and the number two investor in Japan – I think we recognise that any bilateral agreement runs the risk of undermining multilateral agreements with the rest of the world and, in particular, with the developing countries. So I think that strong unconditional support for an FTA needs to be revised. Finally, I would like to say that, whilst we have every sympathy with Japan, future trade policies simply cannot be based on who has had the most recent natural disaster. Keith Taylor  (Verts/ALE

– Mr President, I rise to speak in favour of the financial transaction tax (FTT). The FTT provides an opportunity to redress the balance and the damage caused by the austerity measures, the deficit and the measures adopted to repay it. It is important, though, to introduce taxation which is relevant to the current circumstances since, in the UK for example, Barclays Bank only paid GBP 113 million in corporation tax in 2009, at well below the UK rate of 28%, while the Royal Bank of Scotland allocated EUR 25 billion to tax avoidance schemes that year and cost the British and US exchequer EUR 500 million in lost revenue. In the UK, a group has been formed to support the FTT. It is called the Robin Hood Tax group, after the legendary figure who stole from the rich and gave to the poor. I support its campaign, and I urge Parliament to do likewise. Keith Taylor,  
on behalf of the Verts/ALE Group. 
– Mr President, I was the Green/EFA shadow for both the Saïfi and the Désir reports. We welcome these as important steps forward to secure better human rights and social and environmental standards in the countries that are our trading partners. If those countries want to sell on the lucrative EU markets, we should encourage them to adopt decent and sustainable standards at home. Securing improvement through mandatory clauses and requirements in trade agreements is one way to achieve this. Mrs Saïfi, who did an excellent job as rapporteur, discusses constructively the different levels and aspects of human rights, and environmental and social standards at differing levels. We agree with Ms Saïfi’s suggestion that a world environment organisation be formed and that the ILO status should be strengthened. We liked the sustainable development chapter in FTAs but wish those standards to be binding, not voluntary. Similarly, the GSP schemes should be given proper teeth and be enforceable. But we could not agree with the rapporteur that the human rights clause in the FTA with Colombia was satisfactory. In fact we thought that was a meaningless, formulaic human rights clause that makes a mockery of the aspirations of this House in that regard. Turning to Mr Désir’s report, we could not agree more with him when he names the transnational corporations as a source of negative effects on the environment and on our social standards. They have profited from trade liberalisation and they have exploited cheap labour – and, all too often, cheap materials – but failed to adequately redistribute the wealth they have created at others’ expense. We have successfully amended both reports, and will be supporting both of them when it comes to the vote. In closing, I would very quickly stress that more needs to be done in specifying the human rights and social responsibilities we want to prioritise. We should do so in terms of obligatory requirements and not rely on voluntary codes. Keith Taylor,

 Mr President, on behalf of the Verts/ALE Group I would like to thank the rapporteur, Mrs Meissner, for drawing together this report and developing it alongside the other political groups. As 71% of the Earth’s surface is covered with water, it really does make sense to try and develop an integrated maritime policy. Europe, of course, has 305 000 kilometres of coastline. That was the Commission’s intent back in 2009 when it announced a more horizontal policy approach on areas such as maritime transport, the marine environment and regional and fisheries policies. Today we see the response of the Committee on Transport and Tourism to this fresh direction, in the shape of Mrs Meissner’s report. We will be supporting this report. It is a useful step in the right direction towards caring for, and the sustainable use of, our maritime resource. However, we believe there is still much work to be done. We welcome the report’s suggestions on maritime governance, on sea basin initiatives and strategies, on maritime spatial planning and surveillance, a maritime research framework and observation and data network, and a fund for maritime infrastructure. I am particularly pleased that the report now includes the integration of carbon emission reduction targets and support for renewable solar and wind energies on board vessels. When it comes to the votes later on today, I would particularly like to ask Members to support the rapporteur’s amendment which seeks to include the option of including emission trading schemes in the EU and IMO rules. This was an issue over which the Committee on Transport was evenly split, with 20 votes each side, so it is perfectly right that Mrs Meissner has brought it here today for plenary to vote on. I would ask Members to show some ‘20-20 vision’ and vote for the rapporteur’s amendment, which recognises that these measures sit squarely alongside our wider strategic objectives around CO2
 reduction and the Europe 2020 project. Keith Taylor  (Verts/ALE
),

– I voted in favour of a legislative proposal guaranteeing enhanced and extended paternity/maternity pay in Parliament today. I did so after lobbying from supporters and opponents. I am well aware of the financial conditions in the UK, which will be further worsened by recent budget announcements of more spending cuts. Nevertheless, the European Parliament was in favour of 20 weeks’ maternity leave at full salary, and 2 weeks’ paternity leave, and I believe that this is a sensible investment in the economy, helping reach the EU target of 75% labour participation by 2020. It improves the health of babies and protects the health and welfare of mothers. It is a step to close the existing gender pay gap. On average, in the EU, women earn 17% less than men. If we do not guarantee decent wages during maternity leave, women are punished in their earnings for having children. It is also a positive encouragement to increase fathers' involvement in caring for children. Apart from death and taxes, birth is the only certainty in life. Our children are the future and the improvements voted through today will provide a better and more secure start to their lives. Keith Taylor  (Verts/ALE
).  
– Madam President, I would like to add my support for this oral question, as I find it totally unacceptable for the United States, Canada and Mexico to be seeking to challenge the inclusion of aviation in the EU emissions trading system. In any event, many people believe those aviation conditions from 2012 to be modest in comparison to what we should and could have been able to achieve. For example, this sector will still be allowed to access carbon credits from other industries, and the cap on aviation emissions is nowhere near as challenging as that demanded from other sectors. Including aviation here is at least a step in the right direction, and ends the legislative vacuum it has enjoyed for too long, to the extent that it is the fastest growing source of carbon emissions. Surely the principle of the polluter pays has never been more well deserved than in this instance. In closing, I would say that we must not let established EU decisions be jeopardised by third countries. I urge the Commission and the Council to clearly state that they intend to fully respect the properly adopted EU law in the upcoming ICAO discussions. Keith Taylor  (Verts/ALE

 I welcome the decision of MEPs from across the political spectrum to support this strong resolution condemning Israel for its unprovoked and disproportionate attacks on the Free Gaza humanitarian aid flotilla. I understand that this was the strongest position that Parliament could adopt as a whole, due to differences in position between and within different political groups, and to have such a unified position sends a very clear and unambiguous message to Israel and the international community. Despite voting in favour of the resolution, however, I would have liked it to go even further. Immediately following the attack on the flotilla, I wrote to Commissioner Cathy Ashton, calling for an immediate suspension of the EU Israel Association agreement. Israel has consistently breached the human rights clause of this agreement and its latest move should not be tolerated. I believe that we need actions as well as words from the EU to show that the international community deplores both the siege on Gaza and Israel’s attack on the Free Gaza flotilla. I will continue to call for the suspension of this agreement whenever the opportunity arises, until Israel can demonstrate that it is upholding its human rights obligations towards Palestine.Caroline Lucas,  
on behalf of the Verts/ALE Group. 
– Mr President, let me say how delighted I am that we are finally discussing the Goldstone report in plenary, because it is a vitally important issue, and to date, the EU has been shamefully absent in these issues. It is quite unacceptable that the Council still has not endorsed the recommendations of the Goldstone report. The Commission says it is taking it very seriously, but that is not good enough: we want an explicit endorsement. The Presidency says that it backs it: well, it should back it publicly and explicitly and make sure that the rest of the Council does as well. Against that backdrop, I have to say I am pleased that in Parliament’s motion for a resolution on the Human Rights Council, which we will vote on tomorrow, we have two very strong paragraphs calling on the High Representative and on Member States to publicly demand the implementation of the report’s recommendations. The resolution further calls on them to actively monitor the implementation of the recommendations for consultation of EU external missions and with NGOs in the field, because the evidence we have so far is that neither the Israeli authorities nor Hamas are taking their responsibilities sufficiently seriously. In Israel, the investigations into targets and tactics used during Operation Cast Lead have been carried out by army commanders or military police, severely compromising the independence of the findings, and from the Hamas side there is still a failure to address adequately the firing of rockets into southern Israel. In the light of these failures, it is clear that the EU should put pressure on the UN Secretary-General to prepare a genuinely independent assessment. Finally, given the ongoing humanitarian crisis in Gaza, I call again on the Council and the High Representative to put far more pressure on Israel to lift the siege which is preventing reconstruction and exacerbating the suffering. Caroline Lucas,  
on behalf of the Verts/ALE Group. 
– Mr President, I would like to welcome the statements from both the Council and the Commission, but my question to them both is when are we are going to go beyond the fine words – which I very much agree with – when are we going to have real action? We have heard the same words over and again that we need to ensure that Israel does this or does that, but we need the real leverage to make that happen, otherwise Israel will simply ignore us, as it continues to do. My question is what practically can you do to make sure that we see real movement and progress here? To my mind that has to involve issues like the suspension of the EU-Israel Association Agreement. Focusing on the situation in East Jerusalem, I welcome very much the Swedish Presidency’s initiative and its clarity over the role of Jerusalem as a capital of two states and your firmness about the importance of Israel freezing its settlement activity in East Jerusalem. I also pay tribute to the authors of the EU Heads of Mission report on East Jerusalem itself. That report speaks with a clarity and vision which is all too often absent in these debates. It sets out how Israel’s policy of illegal annexation of East Jerusalem is deliberately designed to weaken the Palestinian community in the city and prevent Palestinian development. But the Heads of Mission called on the Council to adopt a whole range of recommendations as a result of that report, and I believe that we need to see urgent action from the Council to do exactly that. If the EU is serious about its commitment to a two-state solution, it needs to be doing everything possible to preserve and strengthen the Palestinian character and identity of East Jerusalem. The Heads of Mission statement and report show practical ways of doing so. Caroline Lucas  (Verts/ALE
).  
– Madam President, there is a new film on climate change called The Age of Stupid
. It is set in 2055 and focuses on a lone survivor of climate catastrophe. I am haunted by some words from that film, where the actor, looking back to 2009 – looking back to now – says ‘Why, knowing what they knew then, didn’t they act when there was still time?’ In other words, why have we failed to galvanise sufficient political will? Partly it is because we do not talk enough about the benefits of shifting to a post-carbon world – the millions of jobs in green energy, the better-insulated homes, the improved public transport. That is the message the EU must champion. Yet even the most ambitious target the EU is currently proposing – a 30% cut by 2020 – will give us only a 50/50 chance of avoiding the worst of climate change. If you were told that a plane that you were about to get on had a 50/50 chance of crashing, you probably would not get on. And yet the stakes we are playing for in Copenhagen are a lot higher than that. So my message to you is: please, be more ambitious. Do not let the epitaph for Copenhagen be that this was the Age of Stupid. Jean Lambert  (Verts/ALE

 Mr President, I trust our excitable friend is now lying down in a darkened room. I was one of those who negotiated the Return Directive. Certainly the section on detention was an extremely difficult one and I think that the results are not results which we should necessarily be proud of, but the directive is extremely clear that any detention shall only be maintained as long as removal arrangements are in progress and executed with due diligence. So that means that things have to be moving, people have to be informed of what is happening and if that is not the case they should not be in detention. The courts are clear on this, UNHCR has raised questions about the changes going on in Greece, but I think we also have some issues here in terms of the follow-up to the Stockholm Programme, in what we are doing that actually helps make returns sustainable in terms of preparation, prospects and indeed follow-up, to find out what actually does happen to people on return. We have reports – verified reports – of people tortured on return, for example to Sri Lanka and indeed other countries. I think we also need to be paying more attention to those who cannot be returned, either because of the lack of cooperation of the country of return or the situation in that country and of those who are actually stateless. We have to avoid deliberately making people destitute and potential victims of criminals who prey on the vulnerable.

 I think we have at least been able to talk to each other sensibly about these extremely difficult issues over the past. As a political group, we have problems with the readmission agreements, particularly when they are linked to questions of trade, because the readmission agreement is about individuals – human beings – and how we actually treat them. In terms of an integrated approach, I think you are right. The European Union is very good at having a sort of piecemeal approach, but it has not looked at how these approaches actually work together, either for the benefit of the individuals concerned, or indeed for that of the societies in which they are moving.

 Madam President, I would like to start by paying tribute to our rapporteur on this topic. Ria Oomen-Ruijten is very well known in this House – and indeed outside it – as a champion of the rights of cross-border workers. She will be sorely missed in Parliament in the future. I thoroughly agree with her when she talks about the need for those taking up the right to free movement not to be penalised, and to be able to maintain occupational pension rights. But we have seen the difficulties caused by long vesting periods and the implications this also has for age limits on cross-border transfer. We have also seen the irony – I remember from one all-party group meeting on pensions in this House – of the pensions expert addressing us being somebody who, because of his work patterns – two years here, three years there in particular Member States – had actually no acquired occupational pension rights whatsoever. What we have on the table here, while it is certainly not what many of us might have wished for, is nevertheless better. It is better in terms of the age dimension, the shorter vesting period and informed consent – the information that workers have to have – and certainly fairer in terms of the treatment of dormant rights. It has taken us a long time to get to this point. I think many of us would hope that we will see greater possibilities for transferability from one pension scheme to another – being able to take cash across and actually pay it into another scheme so that we avoid this kind of chopping, this fragmentation into different schemes. Nevertheless I think what we have before us is welcome, and about time too. Jean Lambert,  
on behalf of the Verts/ALE Group

 Mr President, I too would like to thank the rapporteur and others who have worked on this. It is true that when we are looking at issues around unemployment, questions about quality and information coming from the administrations have a really important role in this. This has a real impact on people’s lives. We should remember that access to high-quality public services is a strong part of the active inclusion agenda, so it is right that we learn from each other’s experience and really benefit from that. I think that the involvement of all Member States is extremely important and, frankly, I find that the arguments that we have been having over this have been totally dispiriting. We have made a turf war out of something which really should be common sense, namely that we do need to be developing the experience and to be giving people a better experience, whether that is dealing – as people have mentioned – with the Youth Guarantee and youth employment or questions about long-term unemployment and also particularly in relation to vulnerable groups. I think we all believe that cooperation with relevant stakeholders will also add something to this network. That will include not only the regional and local employment offices but also organisations which, for example, represent the unemployed and vulnerable workers. So we hope that we can get over this hiccup at the start and move on to have something that is going to be very constructive. Jean Lambert  (Verts/ALE

 I abstained on the final vote as regards this report for a number of reasons. The large number of separate and split votes, conducted at speed, means there are points where the text is probably no longer coherent with itself. In order to be coherent with my own vote on the Honeyball report at the last Strasbourg session, I find it difficult to support the outcome here. While there is much to support in this report – the need for the Council to break the deadlock on the Maternity Leave Directive, an ongoing commitment to access to care for undocumented women, a repetition of the EP’S commitment to gender budgeting to name but three examples – there were other points which were rejected and mean we left out important issues. I find it difficult to believe that the EPP voted against the right of women to be mothers and workers, or that the EP rejected the need to mainstream gender equality in our work with developing countries. I believe we need to rethink how we approach these reports in the face of determined, regressive attitudes coming from a section of the EP. Women’s rights and progress can no longer be taken for granted. Jean Lambert  (Verts/ALE
). - 
 Mr President, I too would like to thank the rapporteur and the shadow rapporteurs for the work done on this. We have heard mentioned today the checks and balances which are supposed to be there in terms of oversight of security services. It has become clear yet again, for those of us who remember ECHELON, that these are not operational or are being ignored, or that they certainly need changing, to move away from deference to security agencies and the light-touch approach. We have laws in place to limit general phishing expeditions, and we know that there are real questions about the efficiency of mass information. But the relevant checks and balances are clearly not operating, and we have governments making new powers out of vague laws. This working-round: what is on-shore, what is offshore, what is foreign? ‘If I hand you this bit of information and you hand me that about our respective citizens, well, we are legally OK, but we are not actually within the spirit of the law. Another question that is raised here is the inclusion of private companies acting within the state security services. What is the protection for the workers, and what are the rules under which they operate? Finally, I really think that if we are simply looking at a nice diplomatic, cosy chat with the United States as a result of this, it makes you wonder what has to happen before we actually take some definitive action. Jean Lambert  (Verts/ALE
). - 
 Mr President, I would also like to concentrate on the Gutiérrez Prieto report. When our committee decided our position on that, we were very pleased to support the report. It emphasises the social mess that we are in because of the way the crisis has been handled. We have heard about increasing unemployment and increasing poverty. Marian Harkin spoke very movingly on that subject, and it is clear that, at the moment, it looks as if we have no hope in hell of achieving the EU 2020 goals by that date. This does not mean we should walk away from the targets, of course. We are also very pleased that the demand for an interinstitutional agreement has not been included in this report. That discontent about the lack of democracy, about the real influence of this House – as the people’s representatives – on the Annual Growth Survey and on the country-specific recommendations, is broadly felt here, and in our view a Treaty change is not needed to have this interinstitutional agreement. Our feeling is that the Commission and Council should be grabbing this with both hands. I would really like to ask their representatives here whether they are going to take action on the issue and start negotiating such an agreement or not? It is also clear that, if we want the EU 2020 process, the Semester, to have democratic legitimacy, we need to involve civil society and social partners much more strongly.  At the European level, we have seen a coalition of civil society organisations working very hard over the last few years to gain a meaningful role, and with some success.  But we need to see this embedded structurally into this whole process – at national level too. In the UK, we have seen civil society social partners really squeezed out of the process since the change from the past coordination method. We really need to feel that people are on board with this process to actually have a say and to shape it. Jean Lambert,

 Mr President, I should like to say on behalf of my group that we very much welcome the proposals in Parliament’s response on this particular issue. I think a number of us will have met or heard from students, from researchers, who have been hit by the current difficulties, who do not get a reply on time to their applications where the research grant is running out and who will then find themselves in a situation where they cannot take up the offer, which is a problem for them and their working lives. It is also a problem, of course, for the research institutes, the research bodies that thought this was the best person to come in and help their research. We also very much welcome the introduction of the cross-border element in this. We are seeing more and more research being conducted in the European Union across borders. It seems only right that those people conducting that research should also be able to move in order to make the most of the possibilities of what it is they have come to do.  We were concerned that we did not, in this proposal, go back over some of the rights which are already there, for example in terms of family reunification for researchers, and we very much welcome the extension of this to students. We are also pleased to see the increased possibilities for volunteering. I think we need to see this as part of a lifelong learning experience, an experience in terms of capacity-building and indeed in terms of learning from those coming to us for those opportunities; the greater clarity and protection for au pairs is something we also welcome in this proposal.

I sometimes wonder if people have read the report. The Third World was referred to, and I am sure the Member will know the major countries that actually supply researchers and university students to the European Union at the moment. So I am sure that Mr Brons will inform us as to which of the countries are sending the largest number of students and researchers at the moment. Jean Lambert  (Verts/ALE
). - 
 Mr President, as we have heard, my Group also welcomes the Directive and the work of the rapporteur and the negotiating team, and we thoroughly agree with what has been said about the importance of decent work. I would also like to explain to my confused UK colleague that the UK is actually not signing up to this Directive, so some of what was said simply does not apply in this case. But in terms of the important sectors of the workforce listed here, one of which is agriculture, we go to a lot of effort to produce food in the European Union and we are rightly concerned about food waste, yet we have seen a situation where it can be left to rot in the fields because we cannot get a local workforce necessary to complete the harvest. That applies even in some Member States with high unemployment rates and high regional rates. As people have said, there is a long-standing concern here about the conditions for workers in seasonal work, whether EU nationals or third-country nationals. The risk of exploitation, the lack of effective inspection and redress and, at times, an unclear migration status are also a barrier to protection. This gives that clear set of social rights – including accommodation, which has been a major issue and where we have seen people expected to live in horrendous conditions and then charged effectively the whole of their income for it. Like others, we would like to have seen more within this Directive, but we think it is important for the possibilities and the protection it offers. We look forward to its full and effective implementation. Jean Lambert  (Verts/ALE
). -  
Mr President, I am very pleased that we have been talking about many of the rules this afternoon, because I think that, for a number of us in our Member States, the way in which this debate is conducted is as if there are no rules and no regulations. People turn up, and from day one – hallelujah! – the money is showered upon you and you do not have to anything for it. This is a total load of lies and an absolute misrepresentation, but of course it suits some to have a fact-free zone, because facts can be very uncomfortable. Yes, there is evidence that there are problems. Looking at the citizenship reports from the European Union that the Commission has produced, we know that there is a lack of information for people when they move about how things work, what their entitlements are and how they actually fit into systems. We know there is a lack of information about rights, such as rights at work. These are the sort of things that allow the exploitation of people. This is why we discussed labour inspection this week, partly as a direct response to some of the issues that have arisen through people moving within the European Union. We should deal with those difficulties, and we should also deal with the gaps that there are in protection. But the principle is clear. If you move, there is equal treatment with the nationals of the state that you are in. This means that if you are contributing, you have entitlements. And I am really concerned about some of the actions calling into question the entitlements of people who have contributed to a system, so that they are actually going to get nothing for something – the opposite of what is often said.

Mr President, we would very much like to thank the rapporteur, Kinga Göncz, on the rights, equalities and citizenship dossier for the very close cooperation we enjoyed from our committee. For us, one of the issues that we wanted to raise was certainly in terms of anti-discrimination. We know that we have the legislation on the statute books – much of it directly, of course, relevant to employment – but we know that in the world of work itself there is still a lot of work to be done in terms of a real understanding of what equalities mean: for those whom we are serving, but also for our colleagues.  Certainly in terms, for example, of disability we know that at the moment it is virtually impossible for people with disabilities to really be fairly treated in the workplace. So that was a major issue for us. Also in terms of data protection: how that will affect people in the workplace directly was of course an area of concern. But I was also working on this for my political group and there I think that, given that it is International Human Rights Day, talking about this programme is extremely important. We welcome it but, as people have said, it is modest; it is in many respects a small programme which is having to deal with very big tasks. We know too that hate speech is on the increase, whether that is against people with disabilities, or people of a different skin colour or background or sexual orientation.  So we really want to see some work done on that. We know that a lot of the national organisations which exist under the current legislation are seeing their budgets dramatically cut. We know that Equinet too is important in this role and therefore we really want to see some work done on promotion and delivery on very strong issues of anti-discrimination. As has been said, this also encompasses the old Daphne programme and again organisations are seeing their support cut at the moment but domestic violence is increasing at a time of crisis. So we want to be able to continue the ground-breaking work that we have seen in a number of places from organisations working on these issues.  Childrenʼs rights, of course, come in as a newer dimension. We know from other work we have done in this Parliament about the difficulties, for example, in providing real legal guardianship for children within the European Union. So we can see that this programme might well also be able to help deliver something very positive for our children. Jean Lambert  (Verts/ALE

I voted against both of the alternative motions to this report. I find it deeply hypocritical that we are willing to engage in supporting these vital services to those in other parts of the world but are not willing to consider their role in our own Member States. There was much lobbying on the original report and much of that lobbying was either ill-informed or deliberately misleading and sensationalist. This Parliament has, rightly, spent time legislating to protect children and young people from abuse, but they need to know how to protect themselves and that is why sex education is important. No one has been advocating abortion as a form of contraception – indeed, it is often a failure of contraception which raises the issue. However, we know from years of experience that the availability of safe abortion is better than the backstreet alternative. No one in this House has advocated compulsory termination of pregnancy, yet those of us who wished to support the original Committee on Women’s Rights report have been accused of that. I believe the success of the EPP/ECR motion is a retrograde step for this House – hence my vote against their motion. Jean Lambert  (Verts/ALE

I voted against this report, which contains many good proposals, as Amendment 62 on Article 9 was narrowly defeated. This concerned the banning of trawling and gillnets below a depth of 600 metres, thus protecting deep-sea species. Deep-sea environments are increasingly ecologically fragile: things happen slowly there due to the cold and lack of light, yet they are ecologically diverse. Disruption of that environment means it takes a long time to recover – just as high-mountain environments take a long time to recover when they are damaged. Deep-sea trawling trashes the environment necessary for ecological diversity, creating long-term damage for a short-term return. This House has missed a valuable opportunity to further help the marine environment (which is increasingly under threat from climate change) by deferring a decision to stop deep-sea trawling. Hence my decision to vote against this report. Jean Lambert,

Mr President, as others have said, the 2008 elections in Bangladesh saw real progress. The concern many of us have here is that the next election should not go back on what was a very positive election, where all parties could actually accept the results. There are issues about the interim arrangements. On our last delegation visit there – I chair that delegation – we made it very clear that we felt that interim measures had to be put in place well in advance and agreed well in advance, and of course that has not happened. This is part of the problem that we are now seeing, with parties that did not originally like the caretaker government now wanting it, and those that did like it originally now having overseen its removal from the constitution. We are talking about the confidence of all parties in an interim measure. The problem, of course, is that there is no confidence between the leaders of the two main parties. This is why the people of Bangladesh find themselves in a difficult position. We would all agree that we want to see as wide a choice as possible in those next elections. That is what the people of Bangladesh want. That is what they deserve. There is a vibrant civil society in Bangladesh. We are really concerned at the moment that what we are seeing is a bit of a clampdown on some of those who dare to criticise some of the things happening there. We would call, therefore, for those who are currently being charged to be released and to be allowed back into civil society. Jean Lambert  (Verts/ALE

Mr President, people have spoken about their areas. London, which I represent, is home to one million EU nationals, and many will tell you that one of the problems is a lack of awareness of rights, not people abusing them. Also, free movement is one of the most popular rights of the European Union, which may explain why certain people are so busy attacking it at the moment. I wanted to say a couple of words about coordination of social security, given that I worked on that for 10 years in this Parliament. It is about the same rights as nationals; it is about the same qualifying periods as nationals; it has been the practice for years – possibly the sixth piece of legislation ever put in place by the European Union – and the current rules were passed by unanimity in Council. We have heard a lot about why people move. It is not just about salaries, when they take that into account – it is also the cost of living. So do not assume that a higher salary automatically means that people get a better quality of life if they choose to move. Jean Lambert,

Mr President, I am speaking also as a trustee of Solidarity Network in the UK and chair of the Delegation for South Asia, which covers a number of the countries concerned.  I obviously want to support what my colleagues have said about the need to oppose caste-based, descent-based discrimination and that no-one should have to change their faith to be accepted in society, no-one should be refused water in a disaster because of their caste and everyone should be able to benefit from education and use their talents. Particularly, in the week when we celebrate International Day of the Girl Child, I think this has a particular relevance for the Dalits. We have seen recent legislation in Nepal which has challenged discrimination. We have seen EU projects there which have made an enormous difference but, as people have said, unless this is taken up and becomes part of a real cultural shift, all we are doing is supporting some people. This is extremely valuable and shows what it is we are trying to do, but we need to have these rights entrenched, not just in the Constitution, but in implementation in the law. We also need to look at our own Member States. The UK has recently brought caste discrimination into its anti-discrimination legislation, but we are seeing deliberate moves by a particular Home Office minister to prevent the implementation of that change. So this is something we need to be aware of in our own countries, as well as in the values that we promote internationally. Jean Lambert  (Verts/ALE
),  
in writing. – 
I voted in favour of the final report, although I have many reservations. However, we need to improve the current situation. This report provides the bare minimum: we voted to include Indirect Land Use Change (ILUC) factors reflecting the climate impact due to displacement of food production of different feedstocks on greenhouse gas accounting from 2020, and adopted a cap of 6 % on land-based biofuels including energy crops as a safeguard for 2020. My Group opposed the 10 % biofuels target when it was first proposed, but found no majority in the EP. We have now seen the damage that the current target is doing in terms of removing land for food production and transferring its use to fuel production. I deeply regret the attitude of some Members, who have sought to weaken the Commission’s proposal and who now seek to delay agreement with a view to weakening Parliament’s position and doing in negotiations what they could not do in the vote. Jean Lambert  (Verts/ALE
),

– I voted against this report. Not a single proposal from the Committee on Employment and Social Affairs was taken on board: there is nothing that seems to imply that the Services Directive has done anything that might be negative. ‘Only open up our markets and jobs and prosperity will follow’ seems to be its message. This House would not even confirm its previous position, enshrined in the Directive, to preserve the exclusion of welfare services from its scope. Overriding reasons of general interest must be available to local authorities if they are to be able to develop their local economy. I also deeply resent being told that if I vote against this Directive, I am voting against jobs – especially when the report contains no analysis of the effect of the Directive on job loss or job quality. There is much we can do to create employment but a blind faith in opening up markets and further competition does not amount to a job creation strategy. Jean Lambert,

Mr President, I want to start by warmly thanking colleagues from the different political groups who have worked on this report with me in an extremely constructive atmosphere. I also want to thank the many individuals and organisations – whether professional associations, non-governmental organisations or voluntary bodies – that have provided their direct experience and evidence about what is happening on the ground at the moment in our Member States to those who are particularly vulnerable. We have tried to reflect their voices in this report and provide some ways forward. We take as our starting point the declaration that all human beings are born free, with equal dignity and equal rights, and we believe that it is the responsibility of Member States to promote and guarantee those rights. We are also saying that the fundamental values of the European Union should be respected even in a crisis situation, and access to care, healthcare and social assistance should be seen as a basic right for all within the European Union. We know that times are hard in many countries, but we have also heard how political choices are making things harder. We have heard much in this Parliament about the dire situation of young people without employment. Yet some Member States stop health insurance after a certain period of time out of work. It is the European Year of Citizens, yet some Member States are making it more difficult for EU nationals to access healthcare to which they are entitled. The EU has a Roma strategy, yet we still have many examples of prejudice affecting access to healthcare despite the existing EU legislation. The Parliament welcomed the Commission recommendation on children and the recognition of the need to invest in early years to enhance life chances, yet we are seeing an increasing number of children taken into care linked to family poverty, and others going without basic vaccinations. Rising costs, falling income and cuts in services make it difficult to maintain the preventative services to which our governments have signed up, and we are storing up longer-term problems. We heard about those providing and receiving care: many of them informal carers, many becoming a vulnerable group in themselves. People with disabilities told us that not only are some places going back to old models of institutional care rather than supporting independent living, but the levels of hate crime against people with disabilities are rising as they are increasingly viewed as burdens. They are not the only groups now experiencing harassment or even violence. So the list of problems is long, but we also try to look at some solutions. Some are straightforward, such as the provision of accurate and understandable information. Tackling discrimination and extending the legal framework at EU level would also be seen as useful. But we have also called for Member States to carry out social impact assessments on austerity measures and to address the shortfalls. The Commission and Member States, in cooperation with all relevant stakeholders, and that means vulnerable people themselves, should monitor and address – that is the active part in national reform plans – which policies run counter to the EU’s 2020 poverty reduction targets. We want the Commission to include social safeguards protecting care and social services and social protection systems in agreements with countries in receipt of financial assistance. Many of us find it incredible that that has not already been done. We want to see support for carers and are asking the Commission to bring forward proposals for a carers’ leave directive. A social dialogue for the care sector could also help raise standards for the workforce. There are many other proposals in our report and I am sure we will hear those in the debate this morning. Once again, I thank colleagues for their very active input and support in this important issue. Jean Lambert,

Madam President, my thanks to colleagues who have taken part in today’s discussion. I think we have a great deal of consensus here. I just want to reiterate certain of the points, such as the issue of the social impact assessment of cuts that have been made. I think this is coming through as something which people feel is extremely important. I know that it was said that it was almost as if we were demanding of Member States that they do additional homework that we should not be asking them to do. Well, in my earlier life I was a teacher, so maybe I am used to asking people to do homework, but it is also the fact that our Member States have signed up and made a number of commitments.  It was pointed out that they signed up to the UN Convention on the Rights of People with Disabilities. That carries certain responsibilities and implications with it but, even in terms of the national reform plans, there are certain things there which our Member States have agreed to do and agreed to share, and therefore the issue – whether it is about benchmarking, impact assessment or whatever – is about taking account of what they are doing and looking at how they are going to deal with the effects of that in terms of the anti-poverty targets, in terms also, as many have stressed, of the issues of human dignity and indeed what we consider to be solidarity within the European Union and acceptable standards, which I think is extremely important. The issue about the growing inequalities is also something that I think we should really be concerned about. We are well aware of what the adverse impacts of health inequalities are for people’s life chances. There is a lot I think that can be done, even if you are not looking at particularly radical reform: at least close the gaps in systems that allow people to fall through them and lose their right to access care – people who were maybe working on temporary contracts or whatever and who therefore do not actually gain the health benefits that they might otherwise have done in full-term contracts. There are things that can be done to reduce the gaps, to reduce the barriers in terms of access to care.  A lot of points have been made, as well, about the role of carers themselves. It is true – we have heard the figures from all of our Member States about what it actually saves public services when people are caring on an informal basis – but that does need to be recognised. People should not be asked to give up their opportunities to work – their own work-life balance, as it were – to provide that ongoing service without some form of recognition. Recognition within the pension system was mentioned, but it is also extremely important in terms of the support and the care of carers.  There is more that can be done as well, we believe, in terms of actually improving the quality, the decent work side, of those who are providing care on a paid basis. Given the future demands that we have seen, we need to address that very rapidly. Yes, there is money there from the Cohesion Fund, not as much as many of us would have liked, but again that was a political choice made by our national governments, and indeed some in Parliament, but we ought to make sure that this money is spent effectively and to the maximum. Thank you again for the debate and we look forward to the follow-up action on this. Jean Lambert  (Verts/ALE
). -  
Mr President, I have a couple of questions, but firstly I would like to make it absolutely clear that it is scandalous that we even have to look at having a food distribution programme in the European Union and that people are living in poverty and, secondly, that if we are going to, I certainly would support such a Fund. However, I would like some clarification. If each country is expected to participate but does not use the allocated money, what happens to that money as foreseen under this proposal? Is it reallocated within the Fund or does it go back to the general budget?  Secondly, in some accounts of the allocation that I have seen, the UK and Germany, for example, could do very well out of this Fund in terms of getting significant amounts of money and other countries, some of whom have been dependent on this Fund, such as Spain and Portugal, would actually have a lower allocation of monies as a result of Germany and the UK, etc. getting so much. Is that correct?  Thirdly, does one presume, given that this financing is coming from the European Social Fund envelope, that if countries are taking money for the Food Aid Fund from that envelope, they will have less to use from the Social Fund for other things?

 Mr President, we did manage to get in something positive about gender identity and the Qualifications Directive. In terms of the common European asylum system, we are not there yet. Certainly with this latest round of recasts we have seen the limits of the recast system. Many of us feel we fought for every bit of progress that we have managed to get in this package, against a number of Member States that certainly did not want to move.  We can see that we do not yet have a common system if you look at what is happening with one and a half million refugees from Syria, a relatively small number of them in the European Union. Yet when you see the examination of their claims, some countries appear to be doing the job properly, others are not and virtually all claims are being rejected. One of the things that this Parliament, and certainly my Group, wanted was the genuine examination of every claim. We wanted to see high standards of human rights, we wanted to see a higher standard of consistency across Member States, not the lottery that Ms Guillaume has referred to, and we wanted to see the respect of the dignity of individuals, not treating people as criminals and automatically locking them up in closed centres simply because they dared to claim asylum.  So what progress do we have against those benchmarks? My colleagues will speak of Eurodac and procedures. It is true that on Dublin we have made quite a bit of progress compared to the current Dublin II Regulation. A number of the concerns raised in the latest report from a Jesuit refugee service will be addressed, and the recent Court case will be really important. We do not want children left at airports because they have not been picked up by people from the social services of the country to which they are being returned again.  On reception, my judgment would be that we have made marginal progress and that a number of safeguards in terms of levels of support, and indeed safeguards in terms related to detention, really do not take us very far forward. I am sorry to say that. Jean Lambert,

 Mr President, while we broadly welcome the social investment package we felt that much of it was very ‘soft’, and almost a reworking of a number of things which we have heard before. Obviously, we are pleased that we are looking at social investment and the importance of an economic stabiliser being recognised as part of our social protection system. But the issue of adequacy, I think, is still one that many of us are really concerned about. We are seeing more people in poverty now than ever, and we also seem to be losing track of any idea of actually trying to create greater equality in our societies by reducing the gap between rich and poor, not simply looking at how we raise those at the bottom.  The quality of public services is important, obviously, and there is a real area for investment there, including in jobs. But I also want to say something about the recommendation on children. Many people are very worried about demographics in the European Union, and here we have a recommendation which is a very strong one in terms of the focus on early intervention.  We are concerned about nutrition globally, in terms of poverty reduction measures and making the best of children’s futures, and we are seeing a growing need for emergency food aid here. We are seeing vaccination programmes here under threat. We know what happens to children’s life chances if they are in poor housing. The high-quality child care model set out in the Barcelona targets seems to be really mouldering. So where do we really see the action coming on this, not just the policy? What can we expect from the Member States in terms of a range of ministers really working with the economic ministers who seem to be totally in charge of things at the moment?

It is equality within states and between Member States. If you look at some of the impact there at the moment from various social systems, you can see that there are Member States within which there is a greater equality – both newer and older Member States.  It is as much to do with the systems and the values that you put in place as anything else. Therefore the issue of making sure that you have a level of social security which means that people are not left in poverty becomes absolutely crucial. It is not only about older and newer. There are lessons to be learned from, say, the Czech Republic just as there are from Sweden or Denmark. Jean Lambert,

Madam President, I am also speaking in my capacity as Chair of the Delegation for relations with South Asia, which covers Bangladesh. In that capacity, I have also issued a statement of condolence to the families of those tragically killed. A few days ago, Bangladesh moved over 1 million people out of danger from an approaching cyclone. There we saw 13 deaths, mainly people hit by trees, and loss of property. Why am I mentioning this? Well, because I think that it shows what can be done to reduce disasters and risks when government and civil society work together with international help. We need the same determined attitude to risk reduction in the textiles sector, and I could add shipbreaking as well. In the textiles sector we have over 4 million people, mainly women, who ought to be able to feel that they can return home safely after the end of a working day having earned a decent living wage. That has implications – as others have mentioned – for the prices actually paid by the buyers. These recent tragedies have no doubt raised the issue’s profile, and they have certainly raised political pressure. We are seeing a concerted response at the moment, and I am really pleased that the ILO is in there and that the European Union is also offering its support. The accord on fire and building safety, which brings together the trade unions, NGOs, government and the textile retailers, is important. I do not think that we should step back from naming companies who have yet to sign up. That public pressure is really important and, as my colleague has said, it is the coordinated holistic response, not a series of parallel inspections, that is really needed. Equally, some of the other measures that we have talked about, in terms of corporate social responsibility, need to be enforced. So my group will not be supporting the amendments to write these issues out of this resolution. The action plan is certainly to be welcomed. That strengthened role for trade unions, I think we would all agree, is extremely important within this, as is their ability to organise freely and to hold management to account. Management responsibility in Rana Plaza was desperately lacking. Bringing in additional inspectors who have to be able to do their job properly without interference is also important. We would also echo that GSP should be an incentive: yes, there are obviously consequences if you don’t move forward on it, but let us start with the incentive first and across all countries. This is something we should also be considering in the India Free Trade Agreement, as India also has a big textile sector that needs attention. Jean Lambert,

Mr President, I am speaking both in my capacity as Chair of the delegation for South Asia and as a Group member. The European Parliament has supported the need for war crimes trials in Bangladesh, given the atrocities committed during the liberation war 40 years ago and the shadows still cast over the country by those events. Commitment to hold such trials was part of the Awami League manifesto in the last general election, the result of which was widely accepted, and that party is now in government. Many of us have mixed feelings in relation to the issue. We recognise the need for the trials, but deplore that the death penalty is still on the statute books. We understand the political dimension of the trials, but believe it is essential for the courts to be fully in control and that political interference from any quarter is unacceptable and must be resisted for the outcome to be trusted. We understand the desire of Bangladesh to deal with its past, but that should not mean that such trials fall below national and international standards, and there is cause for concern at present. Recent changes to the rules on appeal are particularly worrying. We recognise that public passions will run high but, as the war crimes trials themselves bear witness, there has been enough death, violence and intimidation. It is an absolute tragedy to see the numbers of recent dead, targeting of minorities, hacking to death of law enforcement officers and the use of live ammunition against civilians. So we call on all sides and all those in positions of power and influence to call a halt to the violence. Jean Lambert,

Mr President, I too would like to thank the rapporteur for the good cooperation on this report. I can agree with her introductory remarks and, indeed, those of the Commission and most of the others we have heard this evening, though not quite all.  Her report is important because it recognises that integration is an active policy. It also recognises migrants as individuals, with different needs and, therefore, different programmes that need to work for those individuals if they are going to contribute to our societies and we are also going to contribute to their lives; we do not want people leaving the European Union at any stage having lost skills, having their talents under-used, or indeed not having their lives developed.  In that respect, it is also very important, in terms of the workplace being a key point of integration, to make sure that our anti-discrimination measures are working, that equality of treatment applies and indeed that we have in place a social security system that actually recognises those contributions once people have left the European Union. Jean Lambert,

Mr President, I very much welcome the opportunity to address these questions to the Commission. We are well aware in this Parliament of unemployment across the European Union, but of course young people with disabilities are likely to have the greatest difficulty of all in getting their first job in any sector, even the new ones. So the accessibility proposal mentioned by the Commissioner would be welcome, but we would also like to see a really strong and active implementation of the anti-discrimination directives already on the statute books. Cuts – as we know – are reducing the possibility for independence and social inclusion, even in those countries which have been most progressive. Indeed, as my colleague Marian Harkin has said, there is mounting evidence that people with disabilities face growing hostility in a number of Member States. A recent poll by the UK charity Scope showed that two-thirds of respondents had recently experienced hostility – up by 40% in just four months. This is being stoked by parts of the press, even quality papers like The Telegraph

 Mr President, I also speak in my capacity as Chair of the delegation of the European Parliament which covers Bangladesh, among other countries. Along with others from my group, we would like to express our condolences to the families of those who have died in fires and other accidents in various textile factories and elsewhere. It is an issue, as we have said, which spreads beyond Bangladesh, even though that is our primary focus today. We are well aware that squeezed profit margins do not only lead to pressure on wages but can also lead to shortcuts in safety, and we are concerned that many of the major companies who had contracts with the Tazreen factory did not want to acknowledge that at the time of the tragedy, even though the building had recently passed an evaluation by one of those major contractors. We also welcome the response from the governments in Pakistan and Bangladesh in terms of compensation and commitment to the victims and their families, and we welcome the contribution that has been made by some overseas companies as well; we only wish there were more of them. My colleague has just referred to the outcome of the tripartite meeting yesterday: the ILO, the government, the employers and workers should be seen as positive in terms of commitment to act, to abide by the existing laws, regulations and procedures, and to see that those are properly implemented and that there are consequences if that does not happen. That is a clear responsibility: government. It is also important, in our view, that there are active trade unions and labour rights’ activists such as Aminul Islam, who was recently murdered. It is essential to this process, as our history has shown, to have active trade unions on the ground working with health and safety committees and able to blow the whistle on employers who do not live up to their obligations. But those who have contracts there also have a crucial role in improving standards, and we regret that certain companies – Walmart is one that has been mentioned in the press – have been less than forthcoming and active in that role. As consumers we should be confident that the clothes we wear have not put someone’s life at risk wherever they work, and I welcome what has been done by our delegation in Bangladesh and in other countries to improve labour standards and make sure that everybody is safe at work.

Mr President, we have seen that it is not so easy to stand up against forces like the Taliban when one personally, one’s family and those close to one are actually being threatened, and indeed murdered. We in this Parliament commend Malala’s bravery and that of Hina Khan and countless others – those girls, and boys, who attend education even when they are under threat. There has been political and public outcry in Pakistan over this tragic event, and we should be supporting that outcry. The women’s caucus in the parliament has been instrumental in changing the laws in Pakistan. The problem will now be the implementation, because for some, like the Taliban, education is a threat to the power structure. We have seen almost 1 000 attacks on schools in that area of Pakistan, so we know it is crucially important for the government to invest in universal education and an open curriculum. We should be supporting it in every way we can to stand up against the forces of oppression. Jean Lambert  (Verts/ALE

 I abstained on this vote. There are significant monies to be paid for commitments made over this financial period which are now being requested – and a number of them are late. As the EU cannot carry over monies unspent from previous years, we have been unable to build up any provision for these requests. However, Member States have had those unspent monies returned to their national budgets, where they can carry forward unspent monies: they are now unwilling to restore that money to the EU budget in order to meet commitments made – ironically, largely to Member States. I doubt if they will be willing to forgo those payments and will thus still expect payment. The monies owed are larger than the additional amount requested by Commission and Parliament. I was also angered during the vote by the hypocrisy of some Members who, while arguing for a reduced budget, then voted for additional and continuing funding for the ITER project which is, in my opinion, a waste of Union resources. We also failed to have a qualified majority to end export and tobacco subsidies, when we could find money by ending such damaging projects. Jean Lambert,

. – Mr President, my thanks as well to the rapporteur, not least for trying to push through a wider vision of what the European Year of Citizens should be about, rather than just focusing on the rights to free movement. These rights do need to be better understood. We know that they are crucially important and that for many citizens they are seen as the key indicator of equality within an EU setting, along with coordination of social security rights – maybe this is why certain governments and parties feel that to help make the European Union less acceptable they have to call those rights into question at the moment. As our rapporteur says, the EU needs to be able to answer the bigger questions about what role citizens are playing in decision-making in the European Union. The current crisis certainly makes many feel that they are on the receiving end of decisions made elsewhere, and that decisions are being made to suit unaccountable markets rather than individuals and families living with the consequences. Maybe one of the outcomes we should be looking at for this European Year is to have a real citizens’ charter. Jean Lambert  (Verts/ALE

 I supported the Rapporteur today in his proposal to reject ACTA. The Greens have been an integral part of the campaign to raise awareness of the problems we see within this Treaty, for individual rights and the protection of some of those most in need. Concerns about the draconian and disproportionate penalties linked to copyright infringement in the proposed Treaty are well-known. I am deeply concerned that governments and the Commission have put themselves in the position where ACTA is the subject of an ECJ ruling concerning its compatibility with Fundamental Human Rights. I am also concerned at the potential problems arising for generic medicines – essential for improved healthcare for some of the world’s poorest people. I look forward to future Treaties being given the same rigorous scrutiny as ACTA has received. Jean Lambert  (Verts/ALE

 I regret that the alternative motion for a resolution was not passed as it contained strong guarantees in relation to cloning and transport times for live animals. However, I supported the resolution which was eventually passed as it is a positive step forward. The EU urgently needs to address the effective implementation of existing legislation, not least with regard to the Zoos Directive, and Member States need to increase their rate and standard of inspection in relation animal welfare. It seems that many of my colleagues believe that high welfare standards reduce competitiveness: it is true that those producers who cut costs by cutting standards are a problem: they need to be tackled by making sure rules are kept, where they exist. But we also need to address the rules of international trade, so that methods of production can be made explicit and also used to ban low-welfare imports. Jean Lambert  (Verts/ALE

 I welcome today’s resolution on basic bank accounts, and the Commission’s response during the debate, as being important steps towards greater social inclusion. An estimated 30 million European citizens do not have a bank account and approximately 7 million have been refused access to one. While some may choose not to be within the banking system (and, given current events, who can be surprised at their decision?), many others do not have a choice. They then find it difficult to take out contracts for housing or other essential services, and may find themselves paying higher prices for domestic utilities as companies effectively charge a premium for what they view as ‘high-risk’ groups: the poorest are often hit hardest. I look forward to the Commission’s proposal on legislation later this year. Jean Lambert  (Verts/ALE

Madam President, I think that some of this debate is profoundly depressing when we are talking about how to keep the European Union out of human rights provisions. This is about accession to the European Convention, the European Court, rights for all within the European Union. It closes the gap which is there at the moment and which leaves EU legislation and actions outside the European Court of Human Rights. So the purpose of the Convention, the purpose of the Court, is that it requires governments to meet certain standards – just as many of us want it to require the EU to meet certain standards and to call governments and other authorities to account. Now there may be judgments from the European Court that we do not like. There are some that I am not too happy about. But the whole point is that it is not a pick-and-mix. You do not simply take those judgments that you like and put them into practice, while with others you simply say: I did not like the judges who made that. If you do not like the judges, argue for the reform and training of the judges, and then when you are making those arguments, also remember that a lot of court findings are against countries such as Russia and Ukraine, the very places we have heard complaints about. This is about the rule of law, within a human rights context; about how governments and other authorities respond to being held to account. That is something I want to see brought in for the European Union, not left outside. (The speaker agreed to take a blue-card question under Rule 149(8)) Jean Lambert  (Verts/ALE

– Mr President, I, too, would like to thank the rapporteur for the work that has been done on this. As has been said, it is a highly technical document, but it is an extremely important one for individuals within the European Union. As people have said, this is the latest update of what is – in many ways – one of the earliest pieces of legislation put in place by the European Union. It has been extensively revised – a job that we finished in 2009 – and this is now the update. Very soon, we will be seeing how the new electronic system that underpins this is coming into effect, and hopefully it will be able to deal with citizens’ concerns more rapidly. This concerns the maintenance of rights for people who move across borders for whatever reason or who work in border areas. It deals with the areas of core social security, health care, unemployment, pensions, family benefits, etc. It is extremely important that those rights are upheld. I think we have got quite a citizen-friendly outcome from this first reading agreement. As we have been saying, it is designed to uphold the rights of individuals who are covered by social security systems. It was not put in place to provide an opportunity for businesses – particularly those with mobile workers – to cut costs by providing them with an opportunity to choose the cheapest place to register their workers for social security purposes. I am very pleased that we have actually managed to close that particular loophole within this revision, because to find yourself registered in a country where you feel you have no connection and to seek health care treatment, for example, in the country where you are resident, is bound to lead to confusion and a lot of difficulties for the individual. Even though the company concerned may feel that it is doing a good deal for itself and its shareholders, it is not playing fair by its workers. So we are very pleased to have got the ‘home base’ definition in there, bringing it into line with other legislation to make it very clear to individuals exactly where it is that they are registered and therefore what rights they can expect. I think we have achieved a very good outcome, and we are very pleased to see it going through at first reading. Jean Lambert  (Verts/ALE

 Mr President, I very much welcome the opportunity, at long last, to have a debate on Nigeria. It is a major country, as we have heard, which is extremely important in the region and potentially internationally. I very much regret that the only way we seem to be able to discuss events in Nigeria is via yet another resolution which has taken religion as its focus. I want to respond to some of what has been said today. Let us be clear here that, while Boko Haram is the major force behind the violence, they are not killing only Christians. Muslims have died too. They have also assassinated Muslims who do not agree with them. However, there have also been Muslim deaths where Christians – or so-called Christians – have retaliated. We have also seen these events being condemned by political and faith leaders from a variety of different perspectives. It is very important to remember what has been said about what links this country, and not just what divides it. Yes, corruption is an issue. There is more that we could be doing. I, for one, very much welcome the recent trial in British courts of Ibori, a former governor of Delta State, which put him in jail. There is more that our own countries can do to deal with corruption. The people of Nigeria want a government that is fit for purpose. That is why, as we have heard, they were willing to stand for hours in the sun waiting to vote. However, I believe that the European Union, too, needs to change its relationship with Nigeria and that this Parliament should be strengthening its relationships with the Nigerian Parliament. Jean Lambert  (Verts/ALE

– Mr President, we know that this is a difficult debate. It was difficult the first time round. Indeed, at that time, some of us who were in the House felt that the directive that we are currently discussing was too flexible and we launched a case before the ECJ concerning a couple of the provisions of the directive. Unfortunately, from the point of view of some of us, the ECJ found in the wrong way, but nevertheless it upheld two of the issues, not least about children joining their families. So while there are those who argue that this directive is unnecessarily lax, I think that we can see within the directive how we look differently at issues of flexibility. At present, four Member States covered by the directive are using it in a more and more restrictive manner, despite the rulings of the European Court of Justice. I think that is an issue that the Commission needs to look at. As someone said, the whole goal of this directive was in favour of family reunification as a measure of integration. Integration measures were meant to be part of the goal, not a barrier to family reunification. We know about people being asked to take language courses abroad when those courses do not exist and we know about highly restrictive costs in terms of coming to join family members. All of these measures are put in place to actually erect barriers. I believe, and my group believes, that those certainly need to be challenged. We are also hearing a great deal about issues of marriage and whether marriages are genuine or not. This is, of course, incredibly difficult to determine, not least when you look at the divorce rates of some EU nationals. But, nevertheless, there are ways in which we can deal with this. Some Member States already have legislation in place on issues relating to forced marriage, rather than arranged marriage. The EU has programmes in third countries looking at the empowerment of young women and girls and indeed trying to change family attitudes on the issue. There are also measures that you can take at interview stage to try to establish whether it is a forced marriage or not. I am really interested that people are so concerned about this because a number of us in this House want to bring forward measures looking at the question of forced marriage. We look forward to support from some unusual sources in terms of women’s rights on this. There is flexibility in the directive. We know that. As I say, we have seen ECJ rulings that have tried to put a limit on certain parts of the flexibility, but I think that, rather than looking to open up the directive, we need to ask the Commission what it has been doing in terms of infringement proceedings. In 2008, they said this directive was inadequately transposed and inadequately implemented in a number of Member States. What has happened since to improve that situation? Jean Lambert  (Verts/ALE

 I have voted for this resolution, not because I am enamoured of the content of the so-called six-pack (I voted against much of it) or because the euro is the way forward for all – it is not. I am supporting it because I want decision making on matters of direct interest to the EU to be taken within a clear legal framework and on a clear legal basis. I regret the British Government’s refusal to support concerted EU action and thus assist a push towards this new arrangement. An intergovernmental agreement can inhabit a grey zone, out of clear parliamentary oversight. We need clear parliamentary oversight: from both the EP and national parliaments, and this resolution states that clearly. The proposed intergovernmental agreement also sees governments stepping back from decisions made a few weeks ago, and this does not increase confidence or legal certainty. As the resolution clearly states, we need investment, not just austerity. We need a change of direction – towards a different future, based on reducing the gap between rich and poor and on new investment to help us work within environmental limits. The intergovernmental agreement is a distraction and provides no real solutions. Jean Lambert,

 Mr President, I think it is clear that for all of us the legislation that we are talking about this evening maybe is not the most perfect that we would have hoped for. However I think many of us see it as a positive step forward, and certainly analysis of it that has been done says that it may be positive in terms of integration for the many thousands of people affected by the legislation. It is a simplification in terms of putting together the residence and work permit as a single piece of paperwork. That, we know, was controversial, as well in the way in which it was discussed. But it should be a simplification and, as has been pointed out, there is a due requirement of time so that these applications should not be left sitting on desks as they so often are in many of our Member States. In terms of the rights section of it – which the Committee on Employment and Social Affairs was largely dealing with – I think we have made some progress there. The most important part of it is that we are looking at equality of treatment with Member State nationals in a large number of places, not least in terms of pay, rights of freedom of association and the right to educational/vocational training so that people are actually able to improve their skills base, which is for their own benefit and for the benefit of the company with which they work. The social security dimension is also important and I think that the changes that Parliament managed to make on pensions is one which we should be proud of. Jean Lambert  (Verts/ALE
),  
Blue-card question
. –
 Mr Batten, my understanding is that the UK is not actually signing up to this, so I do not quite understand what you said. Why do you assume that people are going to be flooding to a country which is not actually covered by this directive? Jean Lambert  (Verts/ALE
).  
– Madam President, I, too, would like to thank the rapporteur for this extremely comprehensive report, which I think should be compulsory reading for every Finance Minister. As my colleague, Ms Harkin, has just been saying, what we are seeing at the moment is a disconnect between macro-economic policy and the effect that it actually has on people’s lives on the ground. I want to respond to one or two points made by other colleagues this morning – it is a pity they are not still here. The bailouts are not charity. They are about solidarity, and they come with interest rates attached. The ESF itself is about solidarity, and that is why many of us in this House would like to see an increase in the monies going to other countries to help them combat poverty. In terms of the root causes of poverty, I for one do not believe that it is about a lack of opportunity. In some Member States where, for example, every job vacancy is being pursued by at least five unemployed people – before you even begin to look at skills mismatches and geographical mismatches – I think it is a little bit difficult to say that we are going to cut the benefits of people who have not found a job when those jobs are not there. Investment in social protection, as this report makes very clear, makes sound economic sense. It is an economic stabiliser; it helps recovery; it reduces future costs where we have to pick up the pieces of people whose health has deteriorated and whose educational opportunities have been lost; and it keeps the local economy moving. But I also want to see a reduction in the gap between rich and poor. That is what the ‘Occupy’ movement is about – the power of the 1% as against the other 99% – and that is why issues about a living wage and adequate income are essential in this debate. Jean Lambert,  
on behalf of the Verts/ALE Group.

 Mr President, my group would also like to thank the rapporteur and the shadows for the good cooperation in difficult negotiations. Whilst we certainly welcome the offence of online grooming being created, I must admit we found the attitude of Council in not wanting to incorporate grooming in all senses into this on the grounds that it already exists in national legislation a little surprising, given that many of the other offences here also exist in national legislation. My group, too, welcomes the inclusion for the first time in EU legislation of sex tourism related to children and the jurisdiction over nationals travelling for the purposes of child abuse, but we also agree with the Commission that it is a pity that we have not been able to find a solution on those enjoying habitual residence. We also welcome the recognition of the need to deal with the associated advertising and facilitation of such travel. We, too, welcome the measures to deal with the exclusion of convicted offenders from employment involving direct and regular contact with children. We welcome the move to make it possible for employers to request information about the potential employees for professional or organised voluntary activities with children, according to national law. Article 25 relating to websites was particularly difficult to negotiate, as has already been said, and obviously the priority must
 be to protect children. However, there are legitimate concerns that measures employed for this crucial purpose become co-opted for other purposes of state control. The solution reached in this directive is important and has the full support of my group. We also welcome support for survivors knowing the tragic consequences that such abuse has for so many children throughout their lives. Finally, we welcome the recognition, too, of the difference for consensual sexual activity between young people, whom we do not want to criminalise for behaviour that may be foolish but which is certainly not exploitative. Jean Lambert,  
rapporteur.

 Madam President, I would like to start by thanking all the shadows on this report, the staff members from the three institutions – not least my own office – the Presidencies concerned and the Commission for their interest, effort and commitment over the time we have been negotiating the revision of this directive. I would also like to thank the experts who have supported us. This year marks the 60th anniversary of the Geneva Convention on Refugees. At EU level, it is this directive which sets out the standards for qualification for international protection: for those classic refugees who have a well-founded fear of persecution – such as many of those who dared to oppose Colonel Gadaffi and thus qualified for refugee status; and for those at risk of serious harm – perhaps a teenage girl facing the death penalty in Iran for having sexual intercourse outside marriage, who could then perhaps qualify for subsidiary protection. As well as setting out such criteria, the directive deals with the content of such protection, such as access to healthcare or education. The revision of the directive is limited; it is a recast. The Committee on Civil Liberties, Justice and Home Affairs would like to have dealt with such issues as ‘actors of protection’, where the majority of us believe this should only be the state. That is why we have cited Article 7 as one we think should be looked at in the next review, as should the definition of ‘family members’. I also wish to put on record my own concern at the lack of change in Article 10(1)(d), where the cumulative definition of a social group was maintained by the Commission rather than being offered as an alternative. I trust, at least, that the ten Member States operating in the optional perspective will continue to do so. However, some progress has been made. The definition of a social group which could suffer persecution must now include due consideration of gender-related aspects. We have also included a reference to legal tradition and customs in Recital 30. We also include sexual orientation and, for the first time, gender identity. We should not expect people to deny their identity throughout their lifetime in the hope that this will make them safe from persecution. As concerns children – the topic of the last debate – Recital 18 lays down some principles, though not an exhaustive list, to help in determining the best interests of the child. This principle is also linked to entitlement to benefits. In Article 31 we have sought to improve the tracing of family for unaccompanied minors, across the asylum process. With regard to the content of protection, we have tried to ensure the same treatment for all beneficiaries of international protection and have achieved this in many areas, notably in terms of recognition of qualifications and access to employment. People want to contribute to the country that is providing protection. However, a few Member States have insisted on being able to maintain certain differences between the two groups. This seems to be based on the misapprehension that those at risk of serious harm will need protection for a shorter period of time than those at risk of serious persecution. Our fight – maybe I should say our debate – over the length of residence permits yielded a small victory. However, we would invite the Member States most concerned in relation to difference of treatment to reflect as to whether an annual consideration of status is a good use of public money, and whether it reduces administrative burdens or provides a better context for integration than a period of at least three years. After all, there is a possibility of using cessation provisions if a need for protection changes. To conclude, this revised directive takes small, but important, steps towards a common European asylum policy, but the system is only as common as the consistent high quality of its implementation across all participating Member States. We hope that movement on this directive will help provide impetus for the remaining measures and show that progress is possible. Jean Lambert,  
rapporteur.

 Mr President, I would like to thank all who have participated in the debate today. It is true that we have difficulties with our asylum system; we know that the results can be very different from country to country, and we are also aware that this one step forward is not going to solve all the problems – although we know that it will give greater clarity in certain areas and hopefully provide a stronger base for Member States to build on the good practice which exists in some and to share that with the others. We have heard a number of regrets. Well, we all have a few but, then again, maybe not too few to mention on this occasion. Certainly in terms of the correlation tables: yes, we would like to have seen those. We would have liked to see Member States being very clear about their implementation but, on the other hand, what I think we are more interested at this point is actually moving forward in terms of the content and the common asylum system. I think it says a lot that the rapporteurs from the other asylum dossiers have all been present tonight at this debate, and many have spoken. The willingness of Parliament to move forward is extremely clear, because this is a team effort. I thank people for their warm words, but this is a team effort and involves compromise and solidarity amongst us in Parliament to try and move things in Council. As we have heard, we hope that the movement on this directive – and I hope that groups will be voting in favour of it tomorrow (and maybe one or two groups might like to reconsider their abstentions) – will help provide impetus for the remaining measures and show that progress is possible, and that quality and consistency build confidence among the Member States and the public and deliver sound humanitarian protection for those in need. I think that is what we need to have at the front of our minds when we are looking at this asylum package. Jean Lambert,  
rapporteur for the opinion of the Committee on Employment and Social Affairs
. −
 Madam President, let us hope that, when we come to review this directive, we can do it on a different legal basis. Our committee took the view that the legal basis should be Article 153 of the Treaty, as this matter directly concerns health and safety. We also underlined the importance of providing information and genuine consultation with workers concerning the safety case and safety assessments, not only of sites dealing with spent fuel and radioactive waste, but also as regards how these should be transported, and the need for a rigorous and effective inspection regime with sanctions that are effective, dissuasive and proportionate. We also want to see that all licence holders ensure thorough and ongoing training of all involved in dealing with these substances, including subcontractors – potentially a weak link in the safety chain – casual workers and all others working on site, whatever their job. We also took the view that there was no easy divide between civil and military waste, given that civilians may well handle military waste these days. Jean Lambert,  
on behalf of the Verts/ALE Group. 
– Madam President, I, too, would like to congratulate Ms Berès for taking the initiative on this oral question and resolution. I would also like to thank the Commissioner for his answer. It is all too rare that we get a very specific response from Commissioners to questions in an oral question. My group very much welcomes the proposal from the ILO for the Convention and the recommendation on domestic workers. We are aware that at least 20 of our own Member States have already commented on the draft and been actively involved in this. We look forward to early ratification by those Member States and, indeed, some interesting implementation. People have talked very much about how this group of workers is particularly vulnerable. A lot of the work is done behind closed doors; it is invisible. Often, the workers themselves are isolated, and access to trade unions is often very difficult in this situation. Quite often, if you are taken on as a live-in employee, you can be seen as being on call 24/7. We know in this House that on-call working is a very controversial issue and something that we do not particularly welcome. As has been said, domestic work is often undervalued, or seen as traditional women’s work that ‘anybody can do’, but we have also made the point that a lot of it is actually quite skilled. It can quite often involve nursing care and various aspects of child development. Domestic workers often occupy a real position of trust. While many employers value that, there are only too many who do not. For example, in the UK we have seen a recent case of somebody actually ending up with a prison sentence on a charge of trafficking for domestic servitude. The young woman involved lost four years of her life to her employer, who received a nine-month sentence. So we need to look at how we identify that form of trafficking. Migrant female workers are very vulnerable indeed. We have come across cases, for example, of workers entering the country with diplomats and having their passport taken away; people in that situation have virtually no freedom, have no access to assistance and do not know about their rights. I want to raise one issue concerning Article 17 in the proposed Convention, which is about the role of agencies. I think this is something that we really should be looking at at European level because, increasingly, it is being seen as a weak link in many of the issues that we are facing. Jean Lambert  (Verts/ALE
).  
– Mr President, I speak as Chair of the delegation which covers Pakistan, and I must say that some real crocodile tears have been shed here tonight by people expressing views which are about 180 degrees away from those they normally express. When we have discussed this issue here in the past, we have been assured by the Commission that the items in question have been carefully assessed to ensure they do not clash with EU exports. Has this changed? We have been asked: why textiles from Pakistan? The answer is: because textiles are a major export for them. You cannot expect them to conjure up something within a few months. We, too, had our doubts about the potential effect of this measure in the flood-stricken areas. We raised this matter when we were in Pakistan, and we heard directly from Members of Parliament there that the measure would be of benefit to industry in their constituencies, so I really think that we should consider the message we send if we do not support this measure. Jean Lambert,  
on behalf of the Verts/ALE Group. 
– Madam President, I am very pleased that the Commissioner reminded us that the overwhelming amount of movement in the region has been in North Africa itself. The UNHCR estimates that over 400 000 people have already left Libya. That is something that, having listened to the debate on the Procedures Directive earlier, some of our Members would do well to remember: the majority of people are moving within North Africa. We very much welcome the support given to the UNHCR and other bodies in assisting those displaced. A lot of concern, however, has been voiced at the pressure on Malta and Lampedusa, and quite rightly. It is significant, but not equivalent to what is happening in Tunisia and Egypt. However, there is growing concern about what is happening to minors – unaccompanied or separated at arrival. There is concern that they are not being properly supported or identified. We hope that the Commission will look at their situation and at the situation of those others considered particularly vulnerable at this point. We also welcome the willingness to consider using the Temporary Protection Directive. Could the Commissioner please outline what criteria she will be using in making that assessment as to whether to bring forward a recommendation? Jean Lambert,  
author. 
– Mr President, I think all of us have been very deeply shocked and appalled by the assassination of Minister Shahbaz Bhatti, not least because he is someone known to us in this Parliament: he has visited here, he has met many of us; but also because this is another highly symbolic killing, striking at someone who was looking for reconciliation and work across all minorities in Pakistan. We should also add our condolences not only to his family, but also to all the families of those who have been killed in terrorist attacks in Pakistan. This week, we have seen two such attacks, which have killed and injured more people than, for example, the London bombings. The whole population is suffering, and intimidation is undermining democracy in Pakistan. We are seeing a change in the demographics of certain constituencies, for example, Quetta, as intimidation works to force people out. Our resolution is important in terms of wanting to continue and support the work, in terms of tolerance and mutual understanding. I would like to make the point that we need that in the European Union, too, where certain recent ministerial statements, in my view, have not helped that. So we expect leadership in Pakistan and in the European Union. Jean Lambert,  
on behalf of the Verts/ALE Group. 
– Madam President, I, too, would like to add my voice to that of others who thanked our rapporteur for the very good work that has been done on this report. We are all aware there are national differences, as well as differences within our own political groups, and to come up with anything that gains a significant level of support is quite something. My group is especially pleased that the report before us recognises the importance of first-pillar pensions, the commitment to an adequate level, the issue of being able to provide a decent life. After all, we spent all of last year, 2010, dealing with questions of poverty. And, of course, this is also, for many people, a fixed income, an essential guarantee. Like others, we also welcome the recognition that we need to tackle decent pension provision here for women. We also recognise the importance of tackling discrimination against older workers and using other measures to help people stay in work. For us, too, the portability of pension rights is a crucial issue. More and more people are not working for one company throughout their working life. Indeed, they are working for several, and not always in the same country. And we need to avoid this fragmentation of pension provision, so there is an essential role for the European Union there. We are also pleased to see that this report contains a commitment for second-pillar provision, that it should be available without discrimination on grounds of age, gender and work contract. We would agree as well – and are pleased to see it there – that we need to be adopting more of a life course approach that deals with the different rhythms and patterns of modern working lives, both positive and negative. And again we recognise the importance of solidarity in that first pillar, not least for those whose working lives are involved with more casual labour, short-term contracts and so on. We are concerned at any effort to push third-pillar private pension provision and we agree that it is crucial that people have adequate and clear information. We would also welcome the fact that this report contains – if there is going to be a change in pension provision – adequate time for adaptation for people to reconsider their financial futures. Jean Lambert,  
author.
 – Mr President, I think all of us would want to express our condolences to the family and friends of Salmaan Taseer, the Governor of Punjab put in place by the government of Pakistan, and we are remembering here today his clear support for Asia Bibi – a position he knew to be controversial and indeed dangerous. We are rightly distressed by his murder and the reaction to it by part of the population of Pakistan, but we should not forget, as well, that many have mourned him and have done that in public as a public act. It is an act we should be commending, like, for example, the action taken by the media regulator against certain media with regard to their coverage of the alleged murderer. However, as we know, the blasphemy law in Pakistan puts the lives of Pakistani citizens at risk: Muslim, Christian and others alike, as many speakers have said this afternoon. We are aware that Pakistan is a new democracy, that it is facing conflict on its borders, and that it has faced the disaster of the recent flood, as well as the earthquake only this week. We know that the government is struggling, but we also recognise that it needs our support in terms of developing democracy within Pakistan, not least in the political battle against extremism and for universal human rights, and it is our role as democratic parliamentarians to support all those who are working for positive change and to give them the voice that others would deny them. We are also asking for action by the government of Pakistan, not least to remove the reservations on the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights – which they ratified with a large number of reservations – and we urged this in our recent delegation visit to Pakistan. We want them, as well, to continue the efforts to change the blasphemy law because this is a law that is more abused than properly used. Jean Lambert,  
on behalf of the Verts/ALE Group. 
– Mr President, many in this House will remember that at first reading, this was an extremely hot topic, and I think we are hearing only some of the differences between us. There were concerns about whether market forces would win out over services of general interest; and that people who were concerned about patients’ rights to choose, and to travel, were being pitted against those who were asking which patients would actually exercise that choice. I think what we have, at the end of the day, is a reasonable compromise. As people have pointed out, in cases where things are medically necessary, with a need for urgent treatment, we already have a system in place under social security coordination. This directive is more concerned with the market system, with choice, and with people’s ability to choose where to go, and to have money follow them. So we have clarity now, in that Member States can put in place systems to enable them to ensure that needs can be met. This directive should also be welcomed because it deals with issues around the legal dimension and legal certainty: with where responsibility for follow-up treatment lies; with the question of redress if there are problems; and with issues around ensuring that procedures are carried out by qualified medical professionals. On the issue of rare diseases, we have also achieved a compromise that is better than what we were pursuing first time round. As people have said, for many patients, this will work well, but we also need to take care of our patients in our own Member States. Jean Lambert,  
on behalf of the Verts/ALE Group. 
– Madam President, we, too, have a concern about the variable labour market that we already have across 27 Member States and within those 27 Member States, but our concern is how we move away from this towards something which is more comprehensive and stronger. We want to be sure that we have an agreed basis of rights for the majority of third-country nationals, as originally set out by the Commission and generally improved in the Committee on Employment and Social Affairs. We do not want to see these rights increasingly restrained and constrained, so we will support the widest possible and strongest range of rights in tomorrow’s vote. We want to remind the Council that we are concerned here with individuals who should be able to develop their skills and education, benefit from the social security contributions they make and look forward to claiming their pension entitlements, given, as is recognised in the proposal, that their work supports our economies and indeed our societies. For our group, the commitment to circular migration is also important in Article 11(a). The scope is a vexed issue because we have other existing instruments under discussion which, at times, come into tension. We are also fooling ourselves if we think that what is on the table here is actually going to meet the needs of each and every migrant worker within the European Union. We need a more nuanced approach to ensure that migration works for them, so we are not going to be voting, for example, to include beneficiaries of humanitarian protection. Jean Lambert  (Verts/ALE
).  
– Madam President, I just want to respond to some of the comments which have been made. What Pakistan is trying to do at this point is actually to help itself out of the mess that it is in after the devastating floods. If the factories were in flood-hit areas, they would not be able to produce, so it is not surprising that the factories concerned are not in flood-hit areas. The direct aid that could be put in is miniscule compared to what the need actually is. Distribution of the income from the additional exports is important – we know that for infrastructure, for energy supplies, for schools, for roads, etc. – while there are indeed responsibilities that lie with the democratically elected government of Pakistan in terms of its effectiveness, of income, of tax revenue and so on. People have also talked about the need for greater diversity. If Pakistan had a greater diversity of industrial sectors, we would not be concentrating so much on textiles. I appeal to Members to offer that country this opportunity to help itself out of this disaster. Jean Lambert  (Verts/ALE
).  
– Madam President, I think we are all aware of the importance of minimum income schemes across the European Union, although not all Member States have them in place yet. We also know that there are very big variations in effectiveness, that there is often no clear basis for the amounts that are paid, and that the amounts paid do not necessarily keep pace with rising costs. Some Member States have a very poor take-up, so people are not getting their entitlements, and some also time-limit these income schemes, which seems very bizarre for something that is meant to be a safety net. I believe very strongly that we need a common framework across the European Union that gives clear principles for how we develop these schemes and a clear methodology for working on them. We are not talking about the same level of payment in each Member State and to keep saying this is to perpetuate something which is deeply untrue. We do need to develop these schemes so that everybody in the EU can live in dignity. Jean Lambert,  
on behalf of the Verts/ALE Group. 
– Madam President, as has been said, what is happening in Pakistan at the moment is a real tragedy and will require long-term commitment on behalf of the people of Pakistan and its democratically-elected government for some time to come. I very much welcome the Commissioner’s response, and indeed her longer-term perspective, not least the link to climate resilience. I share the concerns she has voiced about long-term funding for such disasters. I think we would all urge the international community to intensify its response. We would certainly like to welcome India’s increased contribution to the UN fund, because that sends an important political signal. In our view, the international community could go further. It could release more of Pakistan’s own money by taking action to relieve Pakistan’s international debt, much of which was incurred under military regimes. In 2008, Pakistan spent USD 3 billion on debt repayment: this dwarfs the international aid effort. France and Germany are important bilateral donors. I think we should look with some concern at the repayment terms that may be on offer for the loans that are currently being put forward. I would also like to mention that I think it is important to have a similar response from within Pakistan, not least from rich landowners who could, for example, offer some sort of rent relief for poor tenant farmers who are not going to be able to pay their rent for some time to come. Jean Lambert,  
on behalf of the Verts/ALE Group. 
– Madam President, I would very much like to thank Mrs Lynne for the opportunity for us to be debating this tonight, and I welcome a lot of what the Commissioner has said. Indeed, I found quite a lot of it quite encouraging in some ways. You will have recognised, of course, that a number of our questions concern the issues about the vulnerability of older people and a very strong feeling that we have that it is crucially important that people can feel safe with those providing care. While I take your point about the issues about what is a Member State competence, nevertheless, the open method of coordination exists to help Member States work together on something which, while it is not a competence of the European Union, nevertheless is seen as something of common importance. I think certain of the issues, even about basic care, nutrition, etc., are very important within this. I am also wondering what further steps the Commission might take to persuade Member States of the cost-effectiveness of supporting informal carers. There are certainly figures from the UK that recognise that this is a contribution of billions saved in our economy, because the care is being given by close friends or relatives rather than by the state, and that in fact, investing in something like a carer’s allowance and support mechanisms for carers really is worth doing, rather than having people totally worn out, isolated and suffering their own health and mental health problems because they have been caring for hours without background support. I am also interested in what you are saying about the possibilities of improving the qualifications of carers. Part of that issue, of course, is not only that this concerns women, it often concerns migrant women, and therefore a particular sort of investment is needed. But our resolution also talks about the need for contracts to stipulate at least a minimum income, a minimum wage. I would welcome your comments on that. Jean Lambert,  
rapporteur. 
– Mr President, I am not sure that inspiration is going to be what is on offer but this is obviously a very controversial topic that many Members in this House were terrified to come and speak about, so those of us who are brave enough to be here must seize the moment. I want to start firstly by thanking very much all the shadows who worked on this report for their very active involvement and our ability to find a common negotiating position and act as something of a team. I also want to thank the two Presidencies involved – the Czech and particularly the Swedish Presidency – for their more open attitude on this than we have seen in some negotiations, as we were able to negotiate rather than feel we were there to do what Council wanted – well, sometimes anyway. So, what did we achieve? The aim of the common European asylum support system is to deliver consistent high-quality decision making for those in need of protection, and it really can be a matter of life or death for those in need. It is well known that the system is not delivered in a consistent way across Member States. Differences at times are so great between the best and the worst that there is a lack of confidence which can lead to those who try to deliver objective decisions feeling undermined by those who do not. And those who suffer at the end of the day are those in need of protection. There is also a very strong feeling from some Member States under particular pressure that there is a lack of solidarity from others, that their need for support is not given a real practical response. Under the refugee fund, there has been a funding strand for cooperation between Member States which has led to some positive developments, but it has also become clear that there are limits to this more piecemeal approach. The Asylum Support Office is therefore being set up to provide ongoing support to enhance a consistent approach and to provide active support for countries under particular pressure. Specific tasks are already being assigned to it via other legislation. The key points for the European Parliament during the negotiations have been the role of the European Parliament itself in relation to the Asylum Support Office, how to achieve greater solidarity between the Member States, and the role of civil society and UNHCR with the Office. The issues about the role of Parliament have centred around our relationship with the Director in terms of his or her appointment and ongoing links. We have eventually settled on the European Parliament hearing the recommended candidate, offering a confidential opinion and receiving feedback on how that is being taken into account. The Director will also present the annual report to the relevant committee – I cannot quite believe we had to fight for that, but still – and we can also invite the Director to report on the performance of certain tasks. The role of Parliament in relation to agencies is now a topic for discussion in the interinstitutional working group, and I am now a member of the European Parliament team on that – partly due to my experiences and a certain sense of frustration with the negotiations on the Asylum Support Office. As regards solidarity between the Member States, Parliament wanted binding mechanisms, Council wanted to entrench the voluntary nature of cooperation, and the final language is more neutral, but we do have an external evaluation of the Asylum Support Office to look forward to, which will cover the Support Office’s impact on practical cooperation on asylum. On the role of the consultative forum, there is a lot of real expertise available to Member States, and it seemed obvious to us that such expertise could be valuable. We know that some Member States have active relationships with NGOs, and we wanted as well to make sure that local authorities, which often deliver much of what is required under the common system, also had an opportunity to be included. So we are pleased to have been able to breathe a little more life into this body. In conclusion, we feel that the Asylum Support Office could play a very valuable role in developing a common system. We hope it will be of high quality – even if we could not quite get that into the final text – and help engender a sense of mutual confidence and support. I would also ask the Member States involved to be more open to what other institutions, elected authorities and civil society can contribute, because, while this is about cooperation between Member States, it is not entirely intergovernmental. It is a European institution we are creating. Jean Lambert,  
rapporteur. 
– Mr President, I would like to just take an opportunity to clear up one or two questions which have arisen, although it is a pity that some of those asking the questions are not around for the answers. Asylum obligations are clearly set out under international conventions which all Member States have individually signed up to. That is not the same as an immigration policy, and people really should recognise the difference. For those who are concerned about the money – if I may make a party political and national political point here – if certain of our Member States stopped creating asylum seekers from Iraq and Afghanistan, I am sure we could save a lot more money and indeed save people a lot more misery. As regards some of the other points which were raised, it is hoped that improving the quality of the system in certain Member States will be able to increase confidence between Member States and deblock some of the other parts of the asylum system, as well as helping Member States feel that there is support when they are facing particular burdens. As others have pointed out, while some of our Member States do have considerable geographical pressures on them from the flows which arrive, many of the over-burdened countries are actually not in the European Union at all but are elsewhere. I was very interested to hear a colleague arguing for additional support out there, in terms of the Asylum Support Office, but I am afraid I missed the amendments which he tabled on that topic. I also want to be clear that the Asylum Support Office is not there to determine status; it is not taking over the role of Member States in that field. All in all, I welcome the kind comments made by colleagues, I welcome the active involvement of those who have helped me very much on this report, and I am sure that we are all looking forward – or most of us anyway – to being there in Valletta when the ribbon is cut on the Asylum Support Office and we can begin work. Jean Lambert,  
on behalf of the Verts/ALE Group. 
– Mr President, I would like to move an oral amendment which would become paragraph 7a (new). It is signalled on the voting list and my understanding is that it has the support of the political groups co-signing this resolution. It becomes the consequence of paragraph 7. So the new paragraph 7a would read: ‘Hence, calls once again on the Commission to develop a comprehensive European Strategy for Roma Inclusion as the instrument for combating social exclusion and discrimination of Roma in Europe’. Jean Lambert,  
on behalf of the Verts/ALE Group. 
– Mr President, I would like to echo the calls that have been made for a comprehensive strategy here. As has been pointed out, we are now in the European Year for Combating Poverty and Social Exclusion, which we know is difficult in times of recession, and that is why we have been asking for social conditionality on rescue packages so that those who are the most excluded do not find themselves falling even further behind. We have heard already that the gap is widening, which is why our EU 2020 strategy also needs to take into account the need to reduce the gaps between rich and poor. The changes in the regional development funds are important. Local authorities, we would agree with the Council, are important because that is so often where discrimination is most closely felt, on housing and the specific needs of the Roma people there, on education, and on the police whose job it is to protect and not simply to criminalise, as seems to be the way in some Member States. And we want to see high-quality public services. Council will remember its recommendation on the active inclusion of those furthest from the labour market where high-quality public services are seen as crucial. We are interested to know whether the Council and Commission are happy with the absorption rate being shown for funds at the moment. I would also welcome the context change that was strongly put out by the Commission in terms of anti-racism and xenophobia, and would hope that every Member State government would commit itself to those ideals. Jean Lambert  (Verts/ALE
).  
– Mr President, Mr Barroso talked earlier on about wanting an ambitious strategy, and it is true that there are parts of the document EU 2020 which are ambitious, but certainly the greenhouse gas emission figure is not ambitious: it is pathetic, and it is not going to get us where we want to go. We should be looking at 40% by 2020. Of course, the issue is not only about climate but also about resource availability and increasing resource efficiency. There is a lot, as well, that we seem to have seen before in this strategy, not least about economic growth coming through more and more as a goal rather than an indicator. It should not be the goal of a strategy. The EU has many areas where we have tried to decouple growth from transport, energy use, whatever, and it has long been decoupled from jobs. So, can we please not talk as if, somehow, growth is going to deliver jobs? We also need to be looking not just at reducing poverty but reducing inequalities, because that has known demonstrable benefits, and we need to make sure that our financial institutions do not undermine the ambitious goals that we might put in place. Jean Lambert,  
on behalf of the Verts/ALE Group. 
– Mr President, I too would like to thank Stephen Hughes and Liz Lynne for their work on this and indeed to welcome this action, although we would like to have seen it earlier. As has been pointed out, the USA has had legislation in place since 2001. We can now see such legislation in certain parts of the European Union, and at last we are catching up, but, of course, not before many people will already have been affected by this problem. In terms of the risk, the World Health Organisation estimates that, while 90% of exposures to this risk are in the developing world, 90% of reports about occupational infection occur in the United States and the European Union. We know that there is a major issue of under-reporting sharps injuries: estimates range between 40% and 75% and that is huge. Therefore I think we should welcome the fact that, in the social partners’ agreement, clause 11 talks about the duty to report under a no-blame culture. But I think we also need to ask why people are not reporting. Presumably part of it is that they do not understand the risks or that they fear the consequences – not least, perhaps, to their future employment – of reporting such an injury. Indeed in some places we have reports of ineffectual follow-up, in other words, even where people do report, nothing very much happens. Certainly they are not getting even the medical support that they need, let alone the emotional support – or indeed, in some cases, alternative employment, if it is considered that, when they have contracted something like HIV, there may be a risk to patients. We have research which shows that health workers working outside hospitals are more likely to be dissatisfied with the response of employers. People have spoken about the scope of this action. Of course it covers the healthcare sector, and we are very pleased that the agreement covers trainees and subcontractors. I am not entirely sure whether that includes cleaning staff, and I would welcome some clarification on that. But it does not yet cover workers in other professions at risk, so we hope Member States could look at that. The training obligations are extremely important, and I hope Member States will take this seriously: both the giving and receiving of training should be mandatory, as should induction for all new and temporary staff – because I think there is a feeling that if you train people once you never have to look at that issue again. At the moment there is a lack of training even where employers have training policies in place. An issue was raised about the cost. There are estimates that training and preventative measures, including safer devices, account for about a third of the cost of dealing with sharps injuries. That is an important saving in cash-strapped times, as well as being an important issue both for the people concerned and employers, who may indeed find themselves at risk of legal action if they are not taking action to prevent such injuries. Jean Lambert,  
on behalf of the Verts/ALE Group. 
– Madam President, I think there are certain things to be welcomed in the action plan but, as colleagues have correctly pointed out, there are a number of questions there that have not been answered. I think that, when we are looking at this, we are always looking at it from the point of view of the problem that we have and sometimes tend to underestimate the daily reality for people in both Afghanistan and Pakistan of the many deaths, the targeted killings of the Hazara population, for example, in parts of Pakistan, the attacks on girls’ schools, on the police and so many others. The Afghan police were described to us recently as basically cannon fodder for the Taliban. I think many of us are still wondering, really, what it was that we ever thought we would achieve by going in. In terms of the international response, I welcome hearing the Commissioner talking about kick-starting cooperation and particularly mentioning India. The regional approach is important, and I look forward to hearing how we are going to deal with other areas of real tension, such as Kashmir, which the Afghan Ambassador told us the other day really provides a problem for everything that people try to do in the region. We also need, in Pakistan particularly, to be looking at what effective support we are offering in terms of the many thousands of displaced people, and learn from our lack of engagement with those who were displaced to the borders of Pakistan and Afghanistan in the past that a vacuum will be filled. Therefore, we really need to be paying attention to education and meeting the needs of the population who are also looking after those displaced people. Keith Taylor  (Verts/ALE

 Mr President, I speak with a request to postpone the vote on the maritime spatial planning item, from Tuesday, to allow for an accurate translation into Swedish. I am told that the existing translation is at best opaque and at worst misleading and incorrect. I am not aware of any problems with other languages, but that is not surprising. I have spoken with Ms Meissner, the rapporteur, who is in agreement with a postponement of the vote to allow more time for an accurate translation. I am sure you will agree that this is an important point. Members must be fully aware of the details and understand properly what they are voting on. So with that, I would like to formally ask for a delay on that vote. Keith Taylor,

 Mr President, I was the shadow for the Green Group on this. There was good technical harmonisation about connections, which was very welcome. I note average results from what I basically see as a fairly flawed regulation. Member States now have reasonable freedom to decide how and where they want to have the infrastructure and an extended amount of time to decide. The bad result is the lost opportunity to tie greenhouse gas emissions and pollution emissions to the alternative fuels. It is rather technologically blind. There is no reference to renewable energies or to public transport. We need to remember that we started off by trying to reduce emissions, but that does not really seem to feature in the ambition of this report. More could have been done, but the Greens will nevertheless support it from the point of view of technical harmonisation. Keith Taylor  (Verts/ALE
). - 
 Mr President, speaking as the Green shadow rapporteur on the De Backer report, we agree that any measures to improve road safety should be seriously investigated. The terrible death toll on European roads throws down a stark challenge to reduce deaths and injuries. However, our Group is not convinced that a mandatory EU-wide eCall system as currently prescribed is the best alternative. More lives could be saved, for example, if speed limits were cut by 10 km/hour. Such a policy would also be cheaper and would achieve real casualty reductions.  We have concerns about the possibility of the EU having to co-fund the system, about data protection issues, and the increased likelihood of false alarms through the automated systems. Finally, the suggestion that the driver of the vehicle should be able to turn off the machine seems to undermine and complicate the entire idea. My Group will not be supporting either of the reports.

 Mr President, colleagues, I speak to you today as the rapporteur on last year’s report on Regulation (EU) 261/2004 and Regulation (EU) 1008/2008 and also as the Green shadow for Mr Bach’s report today. I would like to thank the rapporteur for his very constructive approach, and I am very pleased to say that we have been able to change the emphasis in the Commission proposal from one which was largely pro-industry – pro-airline – to one which is much more pro-passenger, and that is the version we will vote on today. Although my Group’s view that compensation should be paid after one hour was not carried, a compromise of three hours was, and that also mirrors the European Court of Justice’s position of three hours as the trigger. So this is considerably better than the starting point of the Commission, which was five hours. We are also able to support the narrowing of the extraordinary circumstances to stop airlines hiding behind this excuse to avoid paying compensation to travellers to whom it is due. I am pleased to see the recommendations about better communication with passengers, and I also hope that implementation can be improved. In that regard, I think that our suggestion of independent mediation bodies will prove very useful.  Also, the environmental impact and energy efficiency of passengers’ travel will be provided on the website and on the tickets for the journey. We cannot expect people to be more responsible about carbon emissions if they do not know what the effect of their activities will be.  All in all I am very pleased to be able to support this report, and I would like to thank Mr Bach once more for his constructive approach. Keith Taylor  (Verts/ALE

 I supported this own-initiative report on Blue Growth. However, I regret that the report presents the view that the marine environment is only a section for consideration within Blue Growth, instead of presenting a healthy marine ecosystem as a fundamental prerequisite within which any other sectoral ‘blue’ policies operate. This disagreement with the report is a fundamental one, but I hope this issue is better addressed in other legislative proposals (e.g. on maritime spatial planning).  Whilst amendments which called for a ban on Arctic oil and gas exploration, and for ship emission limits, were not supported in TRAN, most of the report is fine, underlining the importance of key issues for the Green/EFA group: smart, sustainable and inclusive growth, based on an eco-system approach; using the precautionary principle to assess proposals; protecting sustainable maritime sea basin strategy and developing island and coastal tourism.  The report goes on to call for the development of opportunities for ‘clean ships’ that are more energy-efficient and produce less emissions, the construction of a North Sea Offshore Grid for renewable energy, more efficient use of resources and enhanced recycling policies (as an alternative to sea mining), and notes the employment opportunities this approach presents.

 Mr President, as the Greens’ shadow on this file I would like to thank the rapporteur, Brian Simpson, for his effective work. This was a standard procedure to adopt the Maritime Labour Convention (MLC) of 2006 into EU law and in so doing to secure seafarers’ rights and protection. We are going to be supporting this first reading agreement in view of the rapporteur’s call for non-regression. That means no existing standards of social legislation should be allowed to be lowered due to the adoption of this piece of legislation. The recommendations on non-ratification did not go as far as we wanted – our proposal wanted to put ships from flag States not signing the MLC into a higher risk category but this was not accepted. We did at least get an agreement that non-flag vessels would get ‘no more favourable treatment’ than ones sailing under the convention; in Article 3 of the amended directive. Keith Taylor,

 Madam President, the existing MDG framework has helped to galvanise development efforts and guide global and national priorities. Not all the targets have been met, but we have heard some significant targets have been met and that NGOs have found it very useful to have MDGs so that they can encourage their Member State governments to achieve better results. The current MDGs do not, however, sufficiently address the root causes of poverty, such as inequalities within and among countries, as well as issues such as social exclusion, biodiversity and governance.  We need a new approach post-2015 that embraces global governance, with a strong focus on policy coherence for development and the provision of global public goods. By that I mean understanding that global public goods will include international trade, environmental and financial architecture within the context of global governance. It is also important to have a human rights approach, and I am in agreement with most of what the report says. We need a more holistic approach reflecting the outcome of the Rio+20 Conference on sustainable development, and we need to develop the concept of development effectiveness: a combination of development aid, assistance for the provision of global goods and adaptation of governance structure. It is important that the global goals and targets are tailored and adapted to national and regional contexts. In conclusion, is important to say, with regard to recipient countries, that I am very pleased to see the Commissioner is saying we should stick to the 7% GNI target for overseas development aid. Keith Taylor  (Verts/ALE
). - 
 Madam President, the question from the Chair of the Committee on Transport and Tourism is timely and I suspect there is frustration behind it. There were no fewer than three separate reports which included reference to passengers’ hand luggage adopted in 2012. I was the author of the first report which concerned the functioning and application of established rights of people travelling by air and that report was adopted by a large majority.  Concerning hand luggage, we called on the Commission to propose measures which make it possible to harmonise commercial practice so as to protect passengers against excessive restrictions and to allow them to carry on board a reasonable amount of hand luggage. We have heard the horror stories of the travelling public; the Parliament has expressed its wishes. If I heard the Commissioner right, he is going to leave it up to the market and possibly the courts. I simply do not think that is good enough and I really want the Commission to respond to those three separate reports calling for a proactive action. Keith Taylor  (Verts/ALE
),

 I am bitterly disappointed that Parliament voted to endorse ACAA. I do not accept the disingenuous argument of the majority of the PPE and ALDE that this was a purely technical matter. It is clearly a political one. and this vote will send out the message that the EU favours increased trade with Israel over the welfare of hundreds of thousands of Palestinians who are daily subjected to a blockade of Gaza, illegal settlements on their territories, an apartheid wall and property evictions and demolitions. Trade can be a useful tool in development and peacemaking, but voting to accept ACAA is tantamount to endorsing the ongoing violations of international humanitarian and human rights law that Israel is inflicting on the Palestinian territories and people. Through this failure to provide consistency in the application of its fundamental principles, and only weeks after the EU was awarded the Nobel Peace Prize, Parliament is undermining its own, and the EU’s, credibility as a force for good in the world. It makes no sense. I will continue to contribute to peaceful settlement in this troubled region, and strive for justice for all. Keith Taylor  (Verts/ALE

 I did not support the vote to approve Parliament’s resolution on the 2013 EU Budget. Although there were measures within the budget I did support, the overall budget’s net increase of 6.8% over the 2012 levels at a time when states all over the EU are imposing austerity measures is something I cannot condone. I have previously voted to limit additional Member State contributions to the rate of inflation, and suggest a reappraisal of spending priorities for specific budget lines with any unspent money reallocated. Such funds could also be used to meet extra commitments resulting from new post-Treaty of Lisbon measures. A favourite area for funding cuts is the billions of euros spent on the ITER nuclear fusion budget. I believe this selective approach to be a more appropriate method for directing spending in times of financial hardship, rather than approving across-the-board blanket percentage increases. Keith Taylor,  
on behalf of the Verts/ALE Group. 
– Mr President, I should like to thank Mr Kazak for his report. The Greens appreciate that the Commission has come forward with this proposal for a general regulation on MFA. We have been asking for such a regulation for the last five years and now the question arises whether this proposal is still in time. Given that Parliament is about to start the revision of the existing financial instruments for the period 2014-2020, and given the limited size and importance of the MFA instrument, we wonder whether it might not be wise to integrate the MFA into the new European Neighbourhood Instrument from 2014 onwards. This instrument already provides for budget support and could accommodate conditionality. We would only need to integrate the MFA elements when blending grants and loans into the ENI framework, but this should be possible. For Greens this would seem to be the most elegant way to signal to our neighbourhood partners that we are still willing to support their balance of payments stability while solving the problem of how to make MFA more of a true EU structural adjustment programme. We sadly did not receive the support of the other political groups over this idea. Hence we will go with the rapporteur and we will be abstaining in the vote later on.

– I am extremely pleased that this report has been adopted, as it strengthens passenger rights across the board. However, in my original draft report, I urged the Commission to propose an obligation on air carriers to provide a final guarantee covering their liabilities towards passengers in the event of insolvency, bankruptcy or removal of an operating licence. The reference to a final guarantee was weakened at the vote in the Transport and Tourism Committee, confining the proposal to support for stranded passengers to be repatriated in the event of insolvency, bankruptcy, ceased operations or removal of an operating licence. Although I welcome this measure, it is not as strong as the original wording, and I call on the Commission to look into the possibility of proposing a final guarantee to protect passengers when they revise Regulation No 261/2004.

 Mr President, as the standing rapporteur for (sound disappears
), I am particularly concerned by the situation in Kazakhstan where, as we are hearing from many other speakers, fundamental rights continue to be violated. I find it completely unacceptable that, following his recent meeting here in Strasbourg with MEPs to discuss the tragedy in Zhanaozen, Vladimir Kozlov, the leader of the opposition political party, Alga, was arrested by the Kazakh Committee of National Security on his return to the country. Mr Kozlov, as well as other political opponents of the government, was sentenced and put in prison. More recently, I have also met with some Kazakh civil society activists, including Mrs Kozlov, and I was extremely concerned to hear that Mr Kozlov has recently undergone surgery while in prison but that his current state of health is not known. Nobody, including his wife, is allowed any contact with him. Journalists I have also met have been intimidated and threatened with arrest if they write anything against the regime in Kazakhstan. So I think we should call on the Kazakh authorities to end the clampdown on the political opposition and independent media in the country and to immediately release all people incarcerated on politically motivated grounds.

 Madam President, Parliament started to draft a resolution on this, led by the Committee on Transport and Tourism, for which I am the Green shadow. We recognise that maritime piracy is an extremely complicated and problematic issue, but we also believe that it is a horizontal one, incorporating development, security and foreign affairs aspects, while the link with transport issues is more secondary. I am given to understand that the reason why the Transport Committee is the leading committee is because the Commission’s Directorate-General for Mobility and Transport wants to lead on this instead of DG Development. Greens are completely against this shift, as solutions to maritime piracy do not lie primarily with changes to transport policy. Therefore, we welcome the fact that this resolution was taken off the agenda for this plenary session. If Parliament is determined to have a resolution on this, we think it should be led by another committee such as the Subcommittee on Security and Defence, as well as being better timed in order to tie in with the external work and developments. Apart from the fact that we do not think that the Transport Committee should be leading on this issue, the solutions in the draft resolution are not in line with previous Parliament resolutions on piracy, Somalia and the Horn of Africa. Furthermore, they are too militarily based. We are against further militarisation and strongly in favour of strengthening the criminal justice approach to piracy, as advocated by the United Nations Special Advisor on Piracy, Mr Jack Lang. This, ultimately, would also need a change in any future resolution from this place on this issue. Keith Taylor,  
author. 
– Mr President, the end of the death penalty has been achieved in 96 countries across the world and only 23 countries actually carried out executions in 2010. To see any reduction in the numbers of legal killings is encouraging, but hearing about the possibility that executions in Japan will restart under a new Minister of Justice is a matter of great disappointment, both for me and for my political group, the Greens, who are completely opposed to the death penalty. According to reports from Amnesty and the UN Committee on Torture, most of those people sentenced to death in Japan have given confessions under extreme duress. That duress could include physical abuse or sleep deprivation or denial of food and water and the use of a toilet and not being told of the date of their execution until the day itself arrives. But the death penalty is not fail-safe. You cannot acquit someone if they have already been killed. So I think the death penalty is abhorrent and cruel; it degrades both Japanese society and morality and it further punishes the prisoners’ families, who are innocent of any crime. So please join us in voting for a moratorium and the reactivation of the Japanese study group to stop death penalties. Keith Taylor  (Verts/ALE

 I voted for this joint resolution concerning the 8-9 December 2011 Summit as it: suggested that financial and economic consolidation could be achieved through EU law, not Intergovernmental Agreements (IA) or EU treaties; recognised the draft IA did not reflect European Parliament (EP) priorities; supported a stronger role for democratic input from the EP and welcomed inclusion of a parliamentary working group and gave all EU members (including the UK) participation rights in discussions. The draft IA is still being developed, and already there are moves from Member States to dilute the fiscal requirements identified at the December summit (including the so-called ‘golden rule’). For the Single Currency to work there needs to be strong economic and fiscal union between Eurozone (EZ) members. I am not yet convinced that the EZ states will finally agree to necessary strict controls, and I am glad the UK is not part of it. I believe it is in the UK’s best interests to have a strong and stable euro, given that 40% of our trade is with EZ countries. For that reason, and the fact it was the only option achievable at this stage, I supported the resolution. Keith Taylor,

– Madam President, I would like to take this opportunity on behalf of the Green Group to thank Mr Fleckenstein and other political shadows for the very positive way in which this report developed. There was much to agree on and little to dispute, and that was because we believe that EMSA is doing a very good job. I was particularly pleased to see three elements in this report. The first was an increased role for the European Maritime Safety Agency in the monitoring of offshore oil and gas installations; the second, increased preparedness to provide a response to maritime accidents; and the third, an increase in partnership working to deliver maritime surveillance, including the SafeSeaNet programme, hopefully linking up with some of the policies recently approved in our integrated maritime policy. I did attend an EMSA conference in their new centre in Lisbon, and I must say I was very impressed with the breadth of their operations and their commitment to delivering safety on the sea. I commend this report to you and thank Mr Fleckenstein. Keith Taylor,  
on behalf of the Verts/ALE Group. 
– Mr President, the Greens on the Committee on International Trade fully support the report’s position, which is calling for Uzbekistan to take concrete and convincing measures to eradicate child labour before the Parliament can give consent to textiles being covered by the Partnership and Cooperation Agreement. I think it is perfectly right that we should be withholding European Parliament consent to this Protocol with Uzbekistan until those breaches have been stopped. In relation to the textiles, there is clear evidence of state-sanctioned, systematic and widespread forced labour in the Uzbek cotton fields. Schools are being closed during the harvest period and thousands upon thousands of school children are being forced to work in the fields collecting cotton. This is not the treatment that any child should have to tolerate. We would not tolerate it for our children. Those children in Uzbekistan are our children; we should have a responsibility for them. Keith Taylor,

 – Madam President, the Greens support the measures contained in the Koumoutsakos report today, and welcome the opportunity we have for an agreement at first reading. It is necessary – as has been so eloquently pointed out by other speakers – to provide some interim funding so that proper allocations can start from 2013. As it happens, we were unable to secure the amount originally envisaged, but nevertheless there is EUR 40 million available from unspent budget allocations. That money will go towards integrating maritime policy around the development of short sea shipping, the detection of illegal fishing, the integration of sea-basin strategies and maritime surveillance and, importantly, protection of the marine environment. We have particularly enjoyed working with the rapporteur. We now welcome the opportunity to work in partnership with other agencies, notably the European Maritime Safety Agency with its SafeSeaNet programme. Colleagues, please use your vote later today to support this jolly good idea. Keith Taylor  (Verts/ALE

 I did not support the vote to approve the EU Budget 2012 resolution in the EP this week. Within the budget there were measures I supported, such as increased funding for the EU 2020 work, the greening of the CAP, and for Palestine, as well as reducing business flights and freezing MEPs’ daily allowances. However, the overall budget net increase of 5.3% over 2011 levels, at a time when States all over the EU are imposing austerity measures, is something I cannot condone. I voted in June 2011 to limit increases in Member State contributions in line with inflation, and suggested specific budget lines should be revised, and unspent money reallocated. I remain of this view. Keith Taylor,

 Madam President, I rise to speak in favour of Ms Koppa’s resolution. Like many others, I have witnessed the twists and turns in the quest for Palestinian statehood in the United Nations, and like many others I wish them well and hope for a fair and just solution. In speaking today on the Koppa report it is, for me, not a question of being anti-Israel or pro-Palestine. No: it is more one of championing justice and fair play. We must hope that peace soon comes to this troubled region. I spent a few days in the Gaza Strip this summer seeing for myself the abject poverty in which Gazans have to live. I listened to the pleas of mothers and fathers unable to feed or educate their children properly, and of doctors and workers who have to work with the most basic of materials. I listened to teachers and their students, refugees and NGOs, and I heard countless stories of stalled business deals, of jobs lost through lack of raw materials, of social breakdown and the strangulation of trade by the Israeli blockade. It became very clear to me that in Gaza and in the West Bank economic recovery and social recovery go hand in hand. We have some misgivings in our Group about the nature of the agreement, the dislocation of development in social and environmental protection, and some of the practical difficulties around identifying the sources of products. The Koppa report will not solve all the problems between Israel and Palestine; but it is an important marker along the way. As the rapporteur states, opening the EU market to Palestinian products is only the first stage in the construction of a Palestinian state. I urge you to join us in the vote tomorrow in Parliament.

Madam President, I would just like to say thank you to Dieter Koch for the way we have been able to develop these road safety ideas in shadows’ meetings. Halving the casualty figures is a commendable target. As has just been said, every single death is a personal tragedy for someone. I am particularly pleased that we have managed to tackle the three major causes of accidents: alcohol, drugs and speed. We have got here a uniform blood-alcohol level for the whole EU; we have a strong recommendation for 20 mile-an-hour zones or 30 kilometre-an-hour zones in urban areas; we have got safe routes to schools; we have got measures to avoid lorry blind spots. We all have a chance to improve road safety for all road users. Please vote tomorrow to make that happen. Keith Taylor,

 Mr President, earlier in this session we heard a moving statement about the tenth anniversary of the terrible attack on the World Trade Centre. The other anniversary is that of the start of the Doha Round of negotiations towards a trade agreement. I would say that this in fact has killed millions of people – the people in the greatest poverty – or shortened their lives. I think that if we look at the responsibility for that, we see that the WTO has not fulfilled its aspirations to meet the Millennium Development Goals. It has failed the less developed countries in its belief in free trade. What we have in this resolution today is recognition that the Doha Round is dead in the water. It needs to be concluded as swiftly as possible with a package for the less developed countries. We need to concentrate on multilateral agreements because every single bilateral or plurilateral agreement tends to put trade into smaller regional or subregional blocks, and this undermines the multilateral direction which this Parliament believes is the right way to go. Furthermore, I am very pleased to see that the resolution calls for a reform of the WTO, because it is simply no longer fit for purpose. It needs to be revised around the principles of democracy and – bearing in mind that the WTO has never taken a single vote on anything, as it is all done by consensus – it needs to have transparency and accountability. Our Group believes that the wholesale enthusiasm for free trade has ultimately not delivered the promised benefits. We believe that we should be basing WTO reform around trade justice and sustainable development, which should be the watchwords as we develop a new trade body for the planet. Keith Taylor,  
on behalf of the Verts/ALE Group.

 Madam President, this motion is badly needed. Even though we have the 2006 directive, it is plain that it is not working as well as it should. The companies we have heard of exist solely to swindle unsuspecting and sometimes over-stretched organisations, and I find that particularly outrageous when they are damaging community enterprises, often with limited budgets. Using tactics like those of bully-boys and racketeers, they dangle promises in front of unsuspecting people, but I think the message has got to be that if an offer seems to be too good to be true, then most probably it is. These companies are like predatory sharks and they should be stopped. Certainly, our group welcomes this resolution, it is very timely and we will be supporting it, as it calls on the Commission to require Member States to adequately enforce the directive. Keith Taylor  (Verts/ALE

– I will be supporting an amendment in the Multiannual Financial Framework (MFF) report which limits Member State EU contributions to the rate of inflation (currently 3.2%) or below, as suggested by the Heads of State of the UK, France, Germany, Netherlands and Finland. The MMF Garriga Report seeks to increase funding from Member States for the period 2014-2020 by 5%, and this I cannot support at a time when extreme adversity is being experienced in the UK from the government’s dangerous and socially divisive austerity measures. I do support many of the measures promoted in the report and in the Green’s amendments, particularly around the Green New Deal, the end of national rebates and Own Resources for the EU, and am mindful that part of the above-inflation increase is needed to meet obligations under the Lisbon Treaty. There are, however, many expensive budget lines remaining in the MFF that shouldn’t be supported, and I’m thinking of the EUR 6.6 billion to be spent on nuclear fusion as just one example. My argument is that if there isn’t enough funding after inflation-only increases in Member State contributions, ways should be found to re-allocate budget lines to meet any shortfalls. Keith Taylor,  
on behalf of the Verts/ALE Group. 
– Madam President, as others have mentioned, Canada is indeed a solid trading partner for the EU. The abolition of the tariffs now being negotiated in the CETA framework is, on the whole, acceptable to our group. But sadly, CETA does come up with some other demands and political goals which we find deeply worrying. I will mention two of the most troublesome, the first being the negative list in the negotiations on trade liberalisation. Normally, in negotiating FTAs, you name the services that you are ready to liberalise. But under these proposals, all services are open, except those specifically excluded at the outset. As Greens, we think there are some services, particularly those dealing with the general public interest, which are too sensitive and too potentially vulnerable to be negotiated under this ‘negative list’ approach. We have lodged some amendments and we are looking forward to some support from fellow Members. The other area of concern is around procurement. We are concerned about the impact that CETA will have on procurement. To give just one example, the Ontario Green Energy Act would be illegal under CETA. That Act promotes the production and feeding of renewable energies and directs investments into local economies. That is just one example of how CETA will interfere with domestic policy in Canada. Although Canada is one of our oldest trading partners, we cannot deny that occasionally, we do have differences of opinion. Canada is, for instance, opposed to the EU’s GMO policies. It is starting WTO action against the EU import ban on seals, in addition to its barbaric annual seal cull, and do not forget that it is fighting the EU Fuel Quality Directive to protect its exports of tar sands to the EU. I believe that it is important that we voice all these concerns and urge the Commission to remain firm in the principles and policies of this place. Keith Taylor  (Verts/ALE
),

 When we first heard in October 2010 of the Commission’s plans to help Pakistan recover from its awful flooding by removing some customs tariffs, Greens were enthusiastic to help. We still are, but a once-simple idea has become over-complicated and unworkable. Originally the scheme was for 3 years, although we wanted longer to increase investor confidence. But after various business and interest groups had got involved the proposal was reduced to 12 months only – with quarterly reviews! Further, any deal needs a waiver from the World Trade Organisation, which they haven’t approved as some member countries (notably India) are worried about the effect that duty-free Pakistani textiles would have on their own markets. There has been no progress in 5 months, and it’s unlikely we’ll see any soon, if ever. In Plenary today I supported an amendment to send the whole report back to committee for re-working. In doing so I wasn’t voting against helping Pakistan, but I was recognising the report before us simply wouldn’t deliver what Pakistan needs. For me, a major stumbling block has been the WTO. I believe this organisation needs comprehensive reorganisation into a properly democratic, accountable and transparent body. Keith Taylor,  
on behalf of the Verts/ALE Group. 
– Mr President, I, like many others in this House, share the concern for, and the sympathy with, the people affected by the terrible floods in Pakistan. I did so at the time and I do now. However, when I look at how the political will has been lacking, how the corporate interests have interfered and how the WTO has procrastinated, what I see before us are recommendations that dilute the original proposals put forward at such short notice by the Commission. Mention has already been made of the short timescale for the trade preference relaxation, reduced from three years to one year: Pakistan is prevented from maintaining or increasing duties or charges within that time. Moreover, it is proposed to seek not only an annual report on a one-year programme but also quarterly reports on the application and implementation of the measures. This adds up to a huge bureaucracy being created, only to come to an end within one year. So I have a great deal of sympathy with the proposal, which is Amendment 43, to send this back to the committee so that we can come up with something which will actually deliver the help we want to give to Pakistan. Finally, I think this really does point to the acute need to look at how the WTO works and to transform it into a properly democratic body whose proceedings are transparent and whose members are accountable. Keith Taylor,  
on behalf of the Verts/ALE Group. 
– Madam President, it is quite desirable to review the trading arrangements that we have with other countries and it is quite understandable that Japan sees the FTA as particularly attractive in relation to the recent Korea FTA. There is a lot that we can support in the EPP-ALDE-ECR resolution but I think that they are making a mistake to ‘strongly support’ an FTA. That is a direct quote from paragraph 2. I think that is premature support when we do not have impact assessments on the environmental and social effects of an FTA. They are predicting the answer before identifying the effects of implementing the solution. Many people have commented about the non-tariff barriers and the work that has yet to be done by the high-level group. I think that needs a positive step forward. When we bear in mind the importance of Japan as a trading partner – with bilateral trade with the EU standing at EUR 120 billion a year, and with the EU being the number three trading partner for Japan and the number two investor in Japan – I think we recognise that any bilateral agreement runs the risk of undermining multilateral agreements with the rest of the world and, in particular, with the developing countries. So I think that strong unconditional support for an FTA needs to be revised. Finally, I would like to say that, whilst we have every sympathy with Japan, future trade policies simply cannot be based on who has had the most recent natural disaster. Keith Taylor  (Verts/ALE
).  
– Mr President, I rise to speak in favour of the financial transaction tax (FTT). The FTT provides an opportunity to redress the balance and the damage caused by the austerity measures, the deficit and the measures adopted to repay it. It is important, though, to introduce taxation which is relevant to the current circumstances since, in the UK for example, Barclays Bank only paid GBP 113 million in corporation tax in 2009, at well below the UK rate of 28%, while the Royal Bank of Scotland allocated EUR 25 billion to tax avoidance schemes that year and cost the British and US exchequer EUR 500 million in lost revenue. In the UK, a group has been formed to support the FTT. It is called the Robin Hood Tax group, after the legendary figure who stole from the rich and gave to the poor. I support its campaign, and I urge Parliament to do likewise. Keith Taylor,  
on behalf of the Verts/ALE Group. 
– Mr President, I was the Green/EFA shadow for both the Saïfi and the Désir reports. We welcome these as important steps forward to secure better human rights and social and environmental standards in the countries that are our trading partners. If those countries want to sell on the lucrative EU markets, we should encourage them to adopt decent and sustainable standards at home. Securing improvement through mandatory clauses and requirements in trade agreements is one way to achieve this. Mrs Saïfi, who did an excellent job as rapporteur, discusses constructively the different levels and aspects of human rights, and environmental and social standards at differing levels. We agree with Ms Saïfi’s suggestion that a world environment organisation be formed and that the ILO status should be strengthened. We liked the sustainable development chapter in FTAs but wish those standards to be binding, not voluntary. Similarly, the GSP schemes should be given proper teeth and be enforceable. But we could not agree with the rapporteur that the human rights clause in the FTA with Colombia was satisfactory. In fact we thought that was a meaningless, formulaic human rights clause that makes a mockery of the aspirations of this House in that regard. Turning to Mr Désir’s report, we could not agree more with him when he names the transnational corporations as a source of negative effects on the environment and on our social standards. They have profited from trade liberalisation and they have exploited cheap labour – and, all too often, cheap materials – but failed to adequately redistribute the wealth they have created at others’ expense. We have successfully amended both reports, and will be supporting both of them when it comes to the vote. In closing, I would very quickly stress that more needs to be done in specifying the human rights and social responsibilities we want to prioritise. We should do so in terms of obligatory requirements and not rely on voluntary codes. Keith Taylor,  
on behalf of the Verts/ALE Group. –
 Mr President, on behalf of the Verts/ALE Group I would like to thank the rapporteur, Mrs Meissner, for drawing together this report and developing it alongside the other political groups. As 71% of the Earth’s surface is covered with water, it really does make sense to try and develop an integrated maritime policy. Europe, of course, has 305 000 kilometres of coastline. That was the Commission’s intent back in 2009 when it announced a more horizontal policy approach on areas such as maritime transport, the marine environment and regional and fisheries policies. Today we see the response of the Committee on Transport and Tourism to this fresh direction, in the shape of Mrs Meissner’s report. We will be supporting this report. It is a useful step in the right direction towards caring for, and the sustainable use of, our maritime resource. However, we believe there is still much work to be done. We welcome the report’s suggestions on maritime governance, on sea basin initiatives and strategies, on maritime spatial planning and surveillance, a maritime research framework and observation and data network, and a fund for maritime infrastructure. I am particularly pleased that the report now includes the integration of carbon emission reduction targets and support for renewable solar and wind energies on board vessels. When it comes to the votes later on today, I would particularly like to ask Members to support the rapporteur’s amendment which seeks to include the option of including emission trading schemes in the EU and IMO rules. This was an issue over which the Committee on Transport was evenly split, with 20 votes each side, so it is perfectly right that Mrs Meissner has brought it here today for plenary to vote on. I would ask Members to show some ‘20-20 vision’ and vote for the rapporteur’s amendment, which recognises that these measures sit squarely alongside our wider strategic objectives around CO2
 reduction and the Europe 2020 project. Keith Taylor  (Verts/ALE
),

– I voted in favour of a legislative proposal guaranteeing enhanced and extended paternity/maternity pay in Parliament today. I did so after lobbying from supporters and opponents. I am well aware of the financial conditions in the UK, which will be further worsened by recent budget announcements of more spending cuts. Nevertheless, the European Parliament was in favour of 20 weeks’ maternity leave at full salary, and 2 weeks’ paternity leave, and I believe that this is a sensible investment in the economy, helping reach the EU target of 75% labour participation by 2020. It improves the health of babies and protects the health and welfare of mothers. It is a step to close the existing gender pay gap. On average, in the EU, women earn 17% less than men. If we do not guarantee decent wages during maternity leave, women are punished in their earnings for having children. It is also a positive encouragement to increase fathers' involvement in caring for children. Apart from death and taxes, birth is the only certainty in life. Our children are the future and the improvements voted through today will provide a better and more secure start to their lives. Keith Taylor  (Verts/ALE
).  
– Madam President, I would like to add my support for this oral question, as I find it totally unacceptable for the United States, Canada and Mexico to be seeking to challenge the inclusion of aviation in the EU emissions trading system. In any event, many people believe those aviation conditions from 2012 to be modest in comparison to what we should and could have been able to achieve. For example, this sector will still be allowed to access carbon credits from other industries, and the cap on aviation emissions is nowhere near as challenging as that demanded from other sectors. Including aviation here is at least a step in the right direction, and ends the legislative vacuum it has enjoyed for too long, to the extent that it is the fastest growing source of carbon emissions. Surely the principle of the polluter pays has never been more well deserved than in this instance. In closing, I would say that we must not let established EU decisions be jeopardised by third countries. I urge the Commission and the Council to clearly state that they intend to fully respect the properly adopted EU law in the upcoming ICAO discussions. Keith Taylor  (Verts/ALE

 I welcome the decision of MEPs from across the political spectrum to support this strong resolution condemning Israel for its unprovoked and disproportionate attacks on the Free Gaza humanitarian aid flotilla. I understand that this was the strongest position that Parliament could adopt as a whole, due to differences in position between and within different political groups, and to have such a unified position sends a very clear and unambiguous message to Israel and the international community. Despite voting in favour of the resolution, however, I would have liked it to go even further. Immediately following the attack on the flotilla, I wrote to Commissioner Cathy Ashton, calling for an immediate suspension of the EU Israel Association agreement. Israel has consistently breached the human rights clause of this agreement and its latest move should not be tolerated. I believe that we need actions as well as words from the EU to show that the international community deplores both the siege on Gaza and Israel’s attack on the Free Gaza flotilla. I will continue to call for the suspension of this agreement whenever the opportunity arises, until Israel can demonstrate that it is upholding its human rights obligations towards Palestine.Caroline Lucas,  
on behalf of the Verts/ALE Group. 
– Mr President, let me say how delighted I am that we are finally discussing the Goldstone report in plenary, because it is a vitally important issue, and to date, the EU has been shamefully absent in these issues. It is quite unacceptable that the Council still has not endorsed the recommendations of the Goldstone report. The Commission says it is taking it very seriously, but that is not good enough: we want an explicit endorsement. The Presidency says that it backs it: well, it should back it publicly and explicitly and make sure that the rest of the Council does as well. Against that backdrop, I have to say I am pleased that in Parliament’s motion for a resolution on the Human Rights Council, which we will vote on tomorrow, we have two very strong paragraphs calling on the High Representative and on Member States to publicly demand the implementation of the report’s recommendations. The resolution further calls on them to actively monitor the implementation of the recommendations for consultation of EU external missions and with NGOs in the field, because the evidence we have so far is that neither the Israeli authorities nor Hamas are taking their responsibilities sufficiently seriously. In Israel, the investigations into targets and tactics used during Operation Cast Lead have been carried out by army commanders or military police, severely compromising the independence of the findings, and from the Hamas side there is still a failure to address adequately the firing of rockets into southern Israel. In the light of these failures, it is clear that the EU should put pressure on the UN Secretary-General to prepare a genuinely independent assessment. Finally, given the ongoing humanitarian crisis in Gaza, I call again on the Council and the High Representative to put far more pressure on Israel to lift the siege which is preventing reconstruction and exacerbating the suffering. Caroline Lucas,  
on behalf of the Verts/ALE Group. 
– Mr President, I would like to welcome the statements from both the Council and the Commission, but my question to them both is when are we are going to go beyond the fine words – which I very much agree with – when are we going to have real action? We have heard the same words over and again that we need to ensure that Israel does this or does that, but we need the real leverage to make that happen, otherwise Israel will simply ignore us, as it continues to do. My question is what practically can you do to make sure that we see real movement and progress here? To my mind that has to involve issues like the suspension of the EU-Israel Association Agreement. Focusing on the situation in East Jerusalem, I welcome very much the Swedish Presidency’s initiative and its clarity over the role of Jerusalem as a capital of two states and your firmness about the importance of Israel freezing its settlement activity in East Jerusalem. I also pay tribute to the authors of the EU Heads of Mission report on East Jerusalem itself. That report speaks with a clarity and vision which is all too often absent in these debates. It sets out how Israel’s policy of illegal annexation of East Jerusalem is deliberately designed to weaken the Palestinian community in the city and prevent Palestinian development. But the Heads of Mission called on the Council to adopt a whole range of recommendations as a result of that report, and I believe that we need to see urgent action from the Council to do exactly that. If the EU is serious about its commitment to a two-state solution, it needs to be doing everything possible to preserve and strengthen the Palestinian character and identity of East Jerusalem. The Heads of Mission statement and report show practical ways of doing so. Caroline Lucas  (Verts/ALE
).  
– Madam President, there is a new film on climate change called The Age of Stupid
. It is set in 2055 and focuses on a lone survivor of climate catastrophe. I am haunted by some words from that film, where the actor, looking back to 2009 – looking back to now – says ‘Why, knowing what they knew then, didn’t they act when there was still time?’ In other words, why have we failed to galvanise sufficient political will? Partly it is because we do not talk enough about the benefits of shifting to a post-carbon world – the millions of jobs in green energy, the better-insulated homes, the improved public transport. That is the message the EU must champion. Yet even the most ambitious target the EU is currently proposing – a 30% cut by 2020 – will give us only a 50/50 chance of avoiding the worst of climate change. If you were told that a plane that you were about to get on had a 50/50 chance of crashing, you probably would not get on. And yet the stakes we are playing for in Copenhagen are a lot higher than that. So my message to you is: please, be more ambitious. Do not let the epitaph for Copenhagen be that this was the Age of Stupid. Jean Lambert  (Verts/ALE

 Mr President, I trust our excitable friend is now lying down in a darkened room. I was one of those who negotiated the Return Directive. Certainly the section on detention was an extremely difficult one and I think that the results are not results which we should necessarily be proud of, but the directive is extremely clear that any detention shall only be maintained as long as removal arrangements are in progress and executed with due diligence. So that means that things have to be moving, people have to be informed of what is happening and if that is not the case they should not be in detention. The courts are clear on this, UNHCR has raised questions about the changes going on in Greece, but I think we also have some issues here in terms of the follow-up to the Stockholm Programme, in what we are doing that actually helps make returns sustainable in terms of preparation, prospects and indeed follow-up, to find out what actually does happen to people on return. We have reports – verified reports – of people tortured on return, for example to Sri Lanka and indeed other countries. I think we also need to be paying more attention to those who cannot be returned, either because of the lack of cooperation of the country of return or the situation in that country and of those who are actually stateless. We have to avoid deliberately making people destitute and potential victims of criminals who prey on the vulnerable.

 I think we have at least been able to talk to each other sensibly about these extremely difficult issues over the past. As a political group, we have problems with the readmission agreements, particularly when they are linked to questions of trade, because the readmission agreement is about individuals – human beings – and how we actually treat them. In terms of an integrated approach, I think you are right. The European Union is very good at having a sort of piecemeal approach, but it has not looked at how these approaches actually work together, either for the benefit of the individuals concerned, or indeed for that of the societies in which they are moving.

 Madam President, I would like to start by paying tribute to our rapporteur on this topic. Ria Oomen-Ruijten is very well known in this House – and indeed outside it – as a champion of the rights of cross-border workers. She will be sorely missed in Parliament in the future. I thoroughly agree with her when she talks about the need for those taking up the right to free movement not to be penalised, and to be able to maintain occupational pension rights. But we have seen the difficulties caused by long vesting periods and the implications this also has for age limits on cross-border transfer. We have also seen the irony – I remember from one all-party group meeting on pensions in this House – of the pensions expert addressing us being somebody who, because of his work patterns – two years here, three years there in particular Member States – had actually no acquired occupational pension rights whatsoever. What we have on the table here, while it is certainly not what many of us might have wished for, is nevertheless better. It is better in terms of the age dimension, the shorter vesting period and informed consent – the information that workers have to have – and certainly fairer in terms of the treatment of dormant rights. It has taken us a long time to get to this point. I think many of us would hope that we will see greater possibilities for transferability from one pension scheme to another – being able to take cash across and actually pay it into another scheme so that we avoid this kind of chopping, this fragmentation into different schemes. Nevertheless I think what we have before us is welcome, and about time too. Jean Lambert,  
on behalf of the Verts/ALE Group

 Mr President, I too would like to thank the rapporteur and others who have worked on this. It is true that when we are looking at issues around unemployment, questions about quality and information coming from the administrations have a really important role in this. This has a real impact on people’s lives. We should remember that access to high-quality public services is a strong part of the active inclusion agenda, so it is right that we learn from each other’s experience and really benefit from that. I think that the involvement of all Member States is extremely important and, frankly, I find that the arguments that we have been having over this have been totally dispiriting. We have made a turf war out of something which really should be common sense, namely that we do need to be developing the experience and to be giving people a better experience, whether that is dealing – as people have mentioned – with the Youth Guarantee and youth employment or questions about long-term unemployment and also particularly in relation to vulnerable groups. I think we all believe that cooperation with relevant stakeholders will also add something to this network. That will include not only the regional and local employment offices but also organisations which, for example, represent the unemployed and vulnerable workers. So we hope that we can get over this hiccup at the start and move on to have something that is going to be very constructive. Jean Lambert  (Verts/ALE

 I abstained on the final vote as regards this report for a number of reasons. The large number of separate and split votes, conducted at speed, means there are points where the text is probably no longer coherent with itself. In order to be coherent with my own vote on the Honeyball report at the last Strasbourg session, I find it difficult to support the outcome here. While there is much to support in this report – the need for the Council to break the deadlock on the Maternity Leave Directive, an ongoing commitment to access to care for undocumented women, a repetition of the EP’S commitment to gender budgeting to name but three examples – there were other points which were rejected and mean we left out important issues. I find it difficult to believe that the EPP voted against the right of women to be mothers and workers, or that the EP rejected the need to mainstream gender equality in our work with developing countries. I believe we need to rethink how we approach these reports in the face of determined, regressive attitudes coming from a section of the EP. Women’s rights and progress can no longer be taken for granted. Jean Lambert  (Verts/ALE
). - 
 Mr President, I too would like to thank the rapporteur and the shadow rapporteurs for the work done on this. We have heard mentioned today the checks and balances which are supposed to be there in terms of oversight of security services. It has become clear yet again, for those of us who remember ECHELON, that these are not operational or are being ignored, or that they certainly need changing, to move away from deference to security agencies and the light-touch approach. We have laws in place to limit general phishing expeditions, and we know that there are real questions about the efficiency of mass information. But the relevant checks and balances are clearly not operating, and we have governments making new powers out of vague laws. This working-round: what is on-shore, what is offshore, what is foreign? ‘If I hand you this bit of information and you hand me that about our respective citizens, well, we are legally OK, but we are not actually within the spirit of the law. Another question that is raised here is the inclusion of private companies acting within the state security services. What is the protection for the workers, and what are the rules under which they operate? Finally, I really think that if we are simply looking at a nice diplomatic, cosy chat with the United States as a result of this, it makes you wonder what has to happen before we actually take some definitive action. Jean Lambert  (Verts/ALE
). - 
 Mr President, I would also like to concentrate on the Gutiérrez Prieto report. When our committee decided our position on that, we were very pleased to support the report. It emphasises the social mess that we are in because of the way the crisis has been handled. We have heard about increasing unemployment and increasing poverty. Marian Harkin spoke very movingly on that subject, and it is clear that, at the moment, it looks as if we have no hope in hell of achieving the EU 2020 goals by that date. This does not mean we should walk away from the targets, of course. We are also very pleased that the demand for an interinstitutional agreement has not been included in this report. That discontent about the lack of democracy, about the real influence of this House – as the people’s representatives – on the Annual Growth Survey and on the country-specific recommendations, is broadly felt here, and in our view a Treaty change is not needed to have this interinstitutional agreement. Our feeling is that the Commission and Council should be grabbing this with both hands. I would really like to ask their representatives here whether they are going to take action on the issue and start negotiating such an agreement or not? It is also clear that, if we want the EU 2020 process, the Semester, to have democratic legitimacy, we need to involve civil society and social partners much more strongly.  At the European level, we have seen a coalition of civil society organisations working very hard over the last few years to gain a meaningful role, and with some success.  But we need to see this embedded structurally into this whole process – at national level too. In the UK, we have seen civil society social partners really squeezed out of the process since the change from the past coordination method. We really need to feel that people are on board with this process to actually have a say and to shape it. Jean Lambert,

 Mr President, I should like to say on behalf of my group that we very much welcome the proposals in Parliament’s response on this particular issue. I think a number of us will have met or heard from students, from researchers, who have been hit by the current difficulties, who do not get a reply on time to their applications where the research grant is running out and who will then find themselves in a situation where they cannot take up the offer, which is a problem for them and their working lives. It is also a problem, of course, for the research institutes, the research bodies that thought this was the best person to come in and help their research. We also very much welcome the introduction of the cross-border element in this. We are seeing more and more research being conducted in the European Union across borders. It seems only right that those people conducting that research should also be able to move in order to make the most of the possibilities of what it is they have come to do.  We were concerned that we did not, in this proposal, go back over some of the rights which are already there, for example in terms of family reunification for researchers, and we very much welcome the extension of this to students. We are also pleased to see the increased possibilities for volunteering. I think we need to see this as part of a lifelong learning experience, an experience in terms of capacity-building and indeed in terms of learning from those coming to us for those opportunities; the greater clarity and protection for au pairs is something we also welcome in this proposal.

I sometimes wonder if people have read the report. The Third World was referred to, and I am sure the Member will know the major countries that actually supply researchers and university students to the European Union at the moment. So I am sure that Mr Brons will inform us as to which of the countries are sending the largest number of students and researchers at the moment. Jean Lambert  (Verts/ALE
). - 
 Mr President, as we have heard, my Group also welcomes the Directive and the work of the rapporteur and the negotiating team, and we thoroughly agree with what has been said about the importance of decent work. I would also like to explain to my confused UK colleague that the UK is actually not signing up to this Directive, so some of what was said simply does not apply in this case. But in terms of the important sectors of the workforce listed here, one of which is agriculture, we go to a lot of effort to produce food in the European Union and we are rightly concerned about food waste, yet we have seen a situation where it can be left to rot in the fields because we cannot get a local workforce necessary to complete the harvest. That applies even in some Member States with high unemployment rates and high regional rates. As people have said, there is a long-standing concern here about the conditions for workers in seasonal work, whether EU nationals or third-country nationals. The risk of exploitation, the lack of effective inspection and redress and, at times, an unclear migration status are also a barrier to protection. This gives that clear set of social rights – including accommodation, which has been a major issue and where we have seen people expected to live in horrendous conditions and then charged effectively the whole of their income for it. Like others, we would like to have seen more within this Directive, but we think it is important for the possibilities and the protection it offers. We look forward to its full and effective implementation. Jean Lambert  (Verts/ALE

Mr President, I am very pleased that we have been talking about many of the rules this afternoon, because I think that, for a number of us in our Member States, the way in which this debate is conducted is as if there are no rules and no regulations. People turn up, and from day one – hallelujah! – the money is showered upon you and you do not have to anything for it. This is a total load of lies and an absolute misrepresentation, but of course it suits some to have a fact-free zone, because facts can be very uncomfortable. Yes, there is evidence that there are problems. Looking at the citizenship reports from the European Union that the Commission has produced, we know that there is a lack of information for people when they move about how things work, what their entitlements are and how they actually fit into systems. We know there is a lack of information about rights, such as rights at work. These are the sort of things that allow the exploitation of people. This is why we discussed labour inspection this week, partly as a direct response to some of the issues that have arisen through people moving within the European Union. We should deal with those difficulties, and we should also deal with the gaps that there are in protection. But the principle is clear. If you move, there is equal treatment with the nationals of the state that you are in. This means that if you are contributing, you have entitlements. And I am really concerned about some of the actions calling into question the entitlements of people who have contributed to a system, so that they are actually going to get nothing for something – the opposite of what is often said.

Mr President, we would very much like to thank the rapporteur, Kinga Göncz, on the rights, equalities and citizenship dossier for the very close cooperation we enjoyed from our committee. For us, one of the issues that we wanted to raise was certainly in terms of anti-discrimination. We know that we have the legislation on the statute books – much of it directly, of course, relevant to employment – but we know that in the world of work itself there is still a lot of work to be done in terms of a real understanding of what equalities mean: for those whom we are serving, but also for our colleagues.  Certainly in terms, for example, of disability we know that at the moment it is virtually impossible for people with disabilities to really be fairly treated in the workplace. So that was a major issue for us. Also in terms of data protection: how that will affect people in the workplace directly was of course an area of concern. But I was also working on this for my political group and there I think that, given that it is International Human Rights Day, talking about this programme is extremely important. We welcome it but, as people have said, it is modest; it is in many respects a small programme which is having to deal with very big tasks. We know too that hate speech is on the increase, whether that is against people with disabilities, or people of a different skin colour or background or sexual orientation.  So we really want to see some work done on that. We know that a lot of the national organisations which exist under the current legislation are seeing their budgets dramatically cut. We know that Equinet too is important in this role and therefore we really want to see some work done on promotion and delivery on very strong issues of anti-discrimination. As has been said, this also encompasses the old Daphne programme and again organisations are seeing their support cut at the moment but domestic violence is increasing at a time of crisis. So we want to be able to continue the ground-breaking work that we have seen in a number of places from organisations working on these issues.  Childrenʼs rights, of course, come in as a newer dimension. We know from other work we have done in this Parliament about the difficulties, for example, in providing real legal guardianship for children within the European Union. So we can see that this programme might well also be able to help deliver something very positive for our children. Jean Lambert  (Verts/ALE

I voted against both of the alternative motions to this report. I find it deeply hypocritical that we are willing to engage in supporting these vital services to those in other parts of the world but are not willing to consider their role in our own Member States. There was much lobbying on the original report and much of that lobbying was either ill-informed or deliberately misleading and sensationalist. This Parliament has, rightly, spent time legislating to protect children and young people from abuse, but they need to know how to protect themselves and that is why sex education is important. No one has been advocating abortion as a form of contraception – indeed, it is often a failure of contraception which raises the issue. However, we know from years of experience that the availability of safe abortion is better than the backstreet alternative. No one in this House has advocated compulsory termination of pregnancy, yet those of us who wished to support the original Committee on Women’s Rights report have been accused of that. I believe the success of the EPP/ECR motion is a retrograde step for this House – hence my vote against their motion. Jean Lambert  (Verts/ALE

I voted against this report, which contains many good proposals, as Amendment 62 on Article 9 was narrowly defeated. This concerned the banning of trawling and gillnets below a depth of 600 metres, thus protecting deep-sea species. Deep-sea environments are increasingly ecologically fragile: things happen slowly there due to the cold and lack of light, yet they are ecologically diverse. Disruption of that environment means it takes a long time to recover – just as high-mountain environments take a long time to recover when they are damaged. Deep-sea trawling trashes the environment necessary for ecological diversity, creating long-term damage for a short-term return. This House has missed a valuable opportunity to further help the marine environment (which is increasingly under threat from climate change) by deferring a decision to stop deep-sea trawling. Hence my decision to vote against this report. Jean Lambert,

Mr President, as others have said, the 2008 elections in Bangladesh saw real progress. The concern many of us have here is that the next election should not go back on what was a very positive election, where all parties could actually accept the results. There are issues about the interim arrangements. On our last delegation visit there – I chair that delegation – we made it very clear that we felt that interim measures had to be put in place well in advance and agreed well in advance, and of course that has not happened. This is part of the problem that we are now seeing, with parties that did not originally like the caretaker government now wanting it, and those that did like it originally now having overseen its removal from the constitution. We are talking about the confidence of all parties in an interim measure. The problem, of course, is that there is no confidence between the leaders of the two main parties. This is why the people of Bangladesh find themselves in a difficult position. We would all agree that we want to see as wide a choice as possible in those next elections. That is what the people of Bangladesh want. That is what they deserve. There is a vibrant civil society in Bangladesh. We are really concerned at the moment that what we are seeing is a bit of a clampdown on some of those who dare to criticise some of the things happening there. We would call, therefore, for those who are currently being charged to be released and to be allowed back into civil society. Jean Lambert  (Verts/ALE
). -  
Mr President, people have spoken about their areas. London, which I represent, is home to one million EU nationals, and many will tell you that one of the problems is a lack of awareness of rights, not people abusing them. Also, free movement is one of the most popular rights of the European Union, which may explain why certain people are so busy attacking it at the moment. I wanted to say a couple of words about coordination of social security, given that I worked on that for 10 years in this Parliament. It is about the same rights as nationals; it is about the same qualifying periods as nationals; it has been the practice for years – possibly the sixth piece of legislation ever put in place by the European Union – and the current rules were passed by unanimity in Council. We have heard a lot about why people move. It is not just about salaries, when they take that into account – it is also the cost of living. So do not assume that a higher salary automatically means that people get a better quality of life if they choose to move. Jean Lambert,

Mr President, I am speaking also as a trustee of Solidarity Network in the UK and chair of the Delegation for South Asia, which covers a number of the countries concerned.  I obviously want to support what my colleagues have said about the need to oppose caste-based, descent-based discrimination and that no-one should have to change their faith to be accepted in society, no-one should be refused water in a disaster because of their caste and everyone should be able to benefit from education and use their talents. Particularly, in the week when we celebrate International Day of the Girl Child, I think this has a particular relevance for the Dalits. We have seen recent legislation in Nepal which has challenged discrimination. We have seen EU projects there which have made an enormous difference but, as people have said, unless this is taken up and becomes part of a real cultural shift, all we are doing is supporting some people. This is extremely valuable and shows what it is we are trying to do, but we need to have these rights entrenched, not just in the Constitution, but in implementation in the law. We also need to look at our own Member States. The UK has recently brought caste discrimination into its anti-discrimination legislation, but we are seeing deliberate moves by a particular Home Office minister to prevent the implementation of that change. So this is something we need to be aware of in our own countries, as well as in the values that we promote internationally. Jean Lambert  (Verts/ALE

I voted in favour of the final report, although I have many reservations. However, we need to improve the current situation. This report provides the bare minimum: we voted to include Indirect Land Use Change (ILUC) factors reflecting the climate impact due to displacement of food production of different feedstocks on greenhouse gas accounting from 2020, and adopted a cap of 6 % on land-based biofuels including energy crops as a safeguard for 2020. My Group opposed the 10 % biofuels target when it was first proposed, but found no majority in the EP. We have now seen the damage that the current target is doing in terms of removing land for food production and transferring its use to fuel production. I deeply regret the attitude of some Members, who have sought to weaken the Commission’s proposal and who now seek to delay agreement with a view to weakening Parliament’s position and doing in negotiations what they could not do in the vote. Jean Lambert  (Verts/ALE

– I voted against this report. Not a single proposal from the Committee on Employment and Social Affairs was taken on board: there is nothing that seems to imply that the Services Directive has done anything that might be negative. ‘Only open up our markets and jobs and prosperity will follow’ seems to be its message. This House would not even confirm its previous position, enshrined in the Directive, to preserve the exclusion of welfare services from its scope. Overriding reasons of general interest must be available to local authorities if they are to be able to develop their local economy. I also deeply resent being told that if I vote against this Directive, I am voting against jobs – especially when the report contains no analysis of the effect of the Directive on job loss or job quality. There is much we can do to create employment but a blind faith in opening up markets and further competition does not amount to a job creation strategy. Jean Lambert,  
rapporteur
. − 
Mr President, I want to start by warmly thanking colleagues from the different political groups who have worked on this report with me in an extremely constructive atmosphere. I also want to thank the many individuals and organisations – whether professional associations, non-governmental organisations or voluntary bodies – that have provided their direct experience and evidence about what is happening on the ground at the moment in our Member States to those who are particularly vulnerable. We have tried to reflect their voices in this report and provide some ways forward. We take as our starting point the declaration that all human beings are born free, with equal dignity and equal rights, and we believe that it is the responsibility of Member States to promote and guarantee those rights. We are also saying that the fundamental values of the European Union should be respected even in a crisis situation, and access to care, healthcare and social assistance should be seen as a basic right for all within the European Union. We know that times are hard in many countries, but we have also heard how political choices are making things harder. We have heard much in this Parliament about the dire situation of young people without employment. Yet some Member States stop health insurance after a certain period of time out of work. It is the European Year of Citizens, yet some Member States are making it more difficult for EU nationals to access healthcare to which they are entitled. The EU has a Roma strategy, yet we still have many examples of prejudice affecting access to healthcare despite the existing EU legislation. The Parliament welcomed the Commission recommendation on children and the recognition of the need to invest in early years to enhance life chances, yet we are seeing an increasing number of children taken into care linked to family poverty, and others going without basic vaccinations. Rising costs, falling income and cuts in services make it difficult to maintain the preventative services to which our governments have signed up, and we are storing up longer-term problems. We heard about those providing and receiving care: many of them informal carers, many becoming a vulnerable group in themselves. People with disabilities told us that not only are some places going back to old models of institutional care rather than supporting independent living, but the levels of hate crime against people with disabilities are rising as they are increasingly viewed as burdens. They are not the only groups now experiencing harassment or even violence. So the list of problems is long, but we also try to look at some solutions. Some are straightforward, such as the provision of accurate and understandable information. Tackling discrimination and extending the legal framework at EU level would also be seen as useful. But we have also called for Member States to carry out social impact assessments on austerity measures and to address the shortfalls. The Commission and Member States, in cooperation with all relevant stakeholders, and that means vulnerable people themselves, should monitor and address – that is the active part in national reform plans – which policies run counter to the EU’s 2020 poverty reduction targets. We want the Commission to include social safeguards protecting care and social services and social protection systems in agreements with countries in receipt of financial assistance. Many of us find it incredible that that has not already been done. We want to see support for carers and are asking the Commission to bring forward proposals for a carers’ leave directive. A social dialogue for the care sector could also help raise standards for the workforce. There are many other proposals in our report and I am sure we will hear those in the debate this morning. Once again, I thank colleagues for their very active input and support in this important issue. Jean Lambert,  
rapporteur
. − 
Madam President, my thanks to colleagues who have taken part in today’s discussion. I think we have a great deal of consensus here. I just want to reiterate certain of the points, such as the issue of the social impact assessment of cuts that have been made. I think this is coming through as something which people feel is extremely important. I know that it was said that it was almost as if we were demanding of Member States that they do additional homework that we should not be asking them to do. Well, in my earlier life I was a teacher, so maybe I am used to asking people to do homework, but it is also the fact that our Member States have signed up and made a number of commitments.  It was pointed out that they signed up to the UN Convention on the Rights of People with Disabilities. That carries certain responsibilities and implications with it but, even in terms of the national reform plans, there are certain things there which our Member States have agreed to do and agreed to share, and therefore the issue – whether it is about benchmarking, impact assessment or whatever – is about taking account of what they are doing and looking at how they are going to deal with the effects of that in terms of the anti-poverty targets, in terms also, as many have stressed, of the issues of human dignity and indeed what we consider to be solidarity within the European Union and acceptable standards, which I think is extremely important. The issue about the growing inequalities is also something that I think we should really be concerned about. We are well aware of what the adverse impacts of health inequalities are for people’s life chances. There is a lot I think that can be done, even if you are not looking at particularly radical reform: at least close the gaps in systems that allow people to fall through them and lose their right to access care – people who were maybe working on temporary contracts or whatever and who therefore do not actually gain the health benefits that they might otherwise have done in full-term contracts. There are things that can be done to reduce the gaps, to reduce the barriers in terms of access to care.  A lot of points have been made, as well, about the role of carers themselves. It is true – we have heard the figures from all of our Member States about what it actually saves public services when people are caring on an informal basis – but that does need to be recognised. People should not be asked to give up their opportunities to work – their own work-life balance, as it were – to provide that ongoing service without some form of recognition. Recognition within the pension system was mentioned, but it is also extremely important in terms of the support and the care of carers.  There is more that can be done as well, we believe, in terms of actually improving the quality, the decent work side, of those who are providing care on a paid basis. Given the future demands that we have seen, we need to address that very rapidly. Yes, there is money there from the Cohesion Fund, not as much as many of us would have liked, but again that was a political choice made by our national governments, and indeed some in Parliament, but we ought to make sure that this money is spent effectively and to the maximum. Thank you again for the debate and we look forward to the follow-up action on this. Jean Lambert  (Verts/ALE
). -  
Mr President, I have a couple of questions, but firstly I would like to make it absolutely clear that it is scandalous that we even have to look at having a food distribution programme in the European Union and that people are living in poverty and, secondly, that if we are going to, I certainly would support such a Fund. However, I would like some clarification. If each country is expected to participate but does not use the allocated money, what happens to that money as foreseen under this proposal? Is it reallocated within the Fund or does it go back to the general budget?  Secondly, in some accounts of the allocation that I have seen, the UK and Germany, for example, could do very well out of this Fund in terms of getting significant amounts of money and other countries, some of whom have been dependent on this Fund, such as Spain and Portugal, would actually have a lower allocation of monies as a result of Germany and the UK, etc. getting so much. Is that correct?  Thirdly, does one presume, given that this financing is coming from the European Social Fund envelope, that if countries are taking money for the Food Aid Fund from that envelope, they will have less to use from the Social Fund for other things?

 Mr President, we did manage to get in something positive about gender identity and the Qualifications Directive. In terms of the common European asylum system, we are not there yet. Certainly with this latest round of recasts we have seen the limits of the recast system. Many of us feel we fought for every bit of progress that we have managed to get in this package, against a number of Member States that certainly did not want to move.  We can see that we do not yet have a common system if you look at what is happening with one and a half million refugees from Syria, a relatively small number of them in the European Union. Yet when you see the examination of their claims, some countries appear to be doing the job properly, others are not and virtually all claims are being rejected. One of the things that this Parliament, and certainly my Group, wanted was the genuine examination of every claim. We wanted to see high standards of human rights, we wanted to see a higher standard of consistency across Member States, not the lottery that Ms Guillaume has referred to, and we wanted to see the respect of the dignity of individuals, not treating people as criminals and automatically locking them up in closed centres simply because they dared to claim asylum.  So what progress do we have against those benchmarks? My colleagues will speak of Eurodac and procedures. It is true that on Dublin we have made quite a bit of progress compared to the current Dublin II Regulation. A number of the concerns raised in the latest report from a Jesuit refugee service will be addressed, and the recent Court case will be really important. We do not want children left at airports because they have not been picked up by people from the social services of the country to which they are being returned again.  On reception, my judgment would be that we have made marginal progress and that a number of safeguards in terms of levels of support, and indeed safeguards in terms related to detention, really do not take us very far forward. I am sorry to say that. Jean Lambert,

 Mr President, while we broadly welcome the social investment package we felt that much of it was very ‘soft’, and almost a reworking of a number of things which we have heard before. Obviously, we are pleased that we are looking at social investment and the importance of an economic stabiliser being recognised as part of our social protection system. But the issue of adequacy, I think, is still one that many of us are really concerned about. We are seeing more people in poverty now than ever, and we also seem to be losing track of any idea of actually trying to create greater equality in our societies by reducing the gap between rich and poor, not simply looking at how we raise those at the bottom.  The quality of public services is important, obviously, and there is a real area for investment there, including in jobs. But I also want to say something about the recommendation on children. Many people are very worried about demographics in the European Union, and here we have a recommendation which is a very strong one in terms of the focus on early intervention.  We are concerned about nutrition globally, in terms of poverty reduction measures and making the best of children’s futures, and we are seeing a growing need for emergency food aid here. We are seeing vaccination programmes here under threat. We know what happens to children’s life chances if they are in poor housing. The high-quality child care model set out in the Barcelona targets seems to be really mouldering. So where do we really see the action coming on this, not just the policy? What can we expect from the Member States in terms of a range of ministers really working with the economic ministers who seem to be totally in charge of things at the moment?

It is equality within states and between Member States. If you look at some of the impact there at the moment from various social systems, you can see that there are Member States within which there is a greater equality – both newer and older Member States.  It is as much to do with the systems and the values that you put in place as anything else. Therefore the issue of making sure that you have a level of social security which means that people are not left in poverty becomes absolutely crucial. It is not only about older and newer. There are lessons to be learned from, say, the Czech Republic just as there are from Sweden or Denmark. Jean Lambert,

Madam President, I am also speaking in my capacity as Chair of the Delegation for relations with South Asia, which covers Bangladesh. In that capacity, I have also issued a statement of condolence to the families of those tragically killed. A few days ago, Bangladesh moved over 1 million people out of danger from an approaching cyclone. There we saw 13 deaths, mainly people hit by trees, and loss of property. Why am I mentioning this? Well, because I think that it shows what can be done to reduce disasters and risks when government and civil society work together with international help. We need the same determined attitude to risk reduction in the textiles sector, and I could add shipbreaking as well. In the textiles sector we have over 4 million people, mainly women, who ought to be able to feel that they can return home safely after the end of a working day having earned a decent living wage. That has implications – as others have mentioned – for the prices actually paid by the buyers. These recent tragedies have no doubt raised the issue’s profile, and they have certainly raised political pressure. We are seeing a concerted response at the moment, and I am really pleased that the ILO is in there and that the European Union is also offering its support. The accord on fire and building safety, which brings together the trade unions, NGOs, government and the textile retailers, is important. I do not think that we should step back from naming companies who have yet to sign up. That public pressure is really important and, as my colleague has said, it is the coordinated holistic response, not a series of parallel inspections, that is really needed. Equally, some of the other measures that we have talked about, in terms of corporate social responsibility, need to be enforced. So my group will not be supporting the amendments to write these issues out of this resolution. The action plan is certainly to be welcomed. That strengthened role for trade unions, I think we would all agree, is extremely important within this, as is their ability to organise freely and to hold management to account. Management responsibility in Rana Plaza was desperately lacking. Bringing in additional inspectors who have to be able to do their job properly without interference is also important. We would also echo that GSP should be an incentive: yes, there are obviously consequences if you don’t move forward on it, but let us start with the incentive first and across all countries. This is something we should also be considering in the India Free Trade Agreement, as India also has a big textile sector that needs attention. Jean Lambert,

Mr President, I am speaking both in my capacity as Chair of the delegation for South Asia and as a Group member. The European Parliament has supported the need for war crimes trials in Bangladesh, given the atrocities committed during the liberation war 40 years ago and the shadows still cast over the country by those events. Commitment to hold such trials was part of the Awami League manifesto in the last general election, the result of which was widely accepted, and that party is now in government. Many of us have mixed feelings in relation to the issue. We recognise the need for the trials, but deplore that the death penalty is still on the statute books. We understand the political dimension of the trials, but believe it is essential for the courts to be fully in control and that political interference from any quarter is unacceptable and must be resisted for the outcome to be trusted. We understand the desire of Bangladesh to deal with its past, but that should not mean that such trials fall below national and international standards, and there is cause for concern at present. Recent changes to the rules on appeal are particularly worrying. We recognise that public passions will run high but, as the war crimes trials themselves bear witness, there has been enough death, violence and intimidation. It is an absolute tragedy to see the numbers of recent dead, targeting of minorities, hacking to death of law enforcement officers and the use of live ammunition against civilians. So we call on all sides and all those in positions of power and influence to call a halt to the violence. Jean Lambert,

Mr President, I too would like to thank the rapporteur for the good cooperation on this report. I can agree with her introductory remarks and, indeed, those of the Commission and most of the others we have heard this evening, though not quite all.  Her report is important because it recognises that integration is an active policy. It also recognises migrants as individuals, with different needs and, therefore, different programmes that need to work for those individuals if they are going to contribute to our societies and we are also going to contribute to their lives; we do not want people leaving the European Union at any stage having lost skills, having their talents under-used, or indeed not having their lives developed.  In that respect, it is also very important, in terms of the workplace being a key point of integration, to make sure that our anti-discrimination measures are working, that equality of treatment applies and indeed that we have in place a social security system that actually recognises those contributions once people have left the European Union. Jean Lambert,  
on behalf of the Verts/ALE Group
. – 
Mr President, I very much welcome the opportunity to address these questions to the Commission. We are well aware in this Parliament of unemployment across the European Union, but of course young people with disabilities are likely to have the greatest difficulty of all in getting their first job in any sector, even the new ones. So the accessibility proposal mentioned by the Commissioner would be welcome, but we would also like to see a really strong and active implementation of the anti-discrimination directives already on the statute books. Cuts – as we know – are reducing the possibility for independence and social inclusion, even in those countries which have been most progressive. Indeed, as my colleague Marian Harkin has said, there is mounting evidence that people with disabilities face growing hostility in a number of Member States. A recent poll by the UK charity Scope showed that two-thirds of respondents had recently experienced hostility – up by 40% in just four months. This is being stoked by parts of the press, even quality papers like The Telegraph

 Mr President, I also speak in my capacity as Chair of the delegation of the European Parliament which covers Bangladesh, among other countries. Along with others from my group, we would like to express our condolences to the families of those who have died in fires and other accidents in various textile factories and elsewhere. It is an issue, as we have said, which spreads beyond Bangladesh, even though that is our primary focus today. We are well aware that squeezed profit margins do not only lead to pressure on wages but can also lead to shortcuts in safety, and we are concerned that many of the major companies who had contracts with the Tazreen factory did not want to acknowledge that at the time of the tragedy, even though the building had recently passed an evaluation by one of those major contractors. We also welcome the response from the governments in Pakistan and Bangladesh in terms of compensation and commitment to the victims and their families, and we welcome the contribution that has been made by some overseas companies as well; we only wish there were more of them. My colleague has just referred to the outcome of the tripartite meeting yesterday: the ILO, the government, the employers and workers should be seen as positive in terms of commitment to act, to abide by the existing laws, regulations and procedures, and to see that those are properly implemented and that there are consequences if that does not happen. That is a clear responsibility: government. It is also important, in our view, that there are active trade unions and labour rights’ activists such as Aminul Islam, who was recently murdered. It is essential to this process, as our history has shown, to have active trade unions on the ground working with health and safety committees and able to blow the whistle on employers who do not live up to their obligations. But those who have contracts there also have a crucial role in improving standards, and we regret that certain companies – Walmart is one that has been mentioned in the press – have been less than forthcoming and active in that role. As consumers we should be confident that the clothes we wear have not put someone’s life at risk wherever they work, and I welcome what has been done by our delegation in Bangladesh and in other countries to improve labour standards and make sure that everybody is safe at work.

Mr President, we have seen that it is not so easy to stand up against forces like the Taliban when one personally, one’s family and those close to one are actually being threatened, and indeed murdered. We in this Parliament commend Malala’s bravery and that of Hina Khan and countless others – those girls, and boys, who attend education even when they are under threat. There has been political and public outcry in Pakistan over this tragic event, and we should be supporting that outcry. The women’s caucus in the parliament has been instrumental in changing the laws in Pakistan. The problem will now be the implementation, because for some, like the Taliban, education is a threat to the power structure. We have seen almost 1 000 attacks on schools in that area of Pakistan, so we know it is crucially important for the government to invest in universal education and an open curriculum. We should be supporting it in every way we can to stand up against the forces of oppression. Jean Lambert  (Verts/ALE

 I abstained on this vote. There are significant monies to be paid for commitments made over this financial period which are now being requested – and a number of them are late. As the EU cannot carry over monies unspent from previous years, we have been unable to build up any provision for these requests. However, Member States have had those unspent monies returned to their national budgets, where they can carry forward unspent monies: they are now unwilling to restore that money to the EU budget in order to meet commitments made – ironically, largely to Member States. I doubt if they will be willing to forgo those payments and will thus still expect payment. The monies owed are larger than the additional amount requested by Commission and Parliament. I was also angered during the vote by the hypocrisy of some Members who, while arguing for a reduced budget, then voted for additional and continuing funding for the ITER project which is, in my opinion, a waste of Union resources. We also failed to have a qualified majority to end export and tobacco subsidies, when we could find money by ending such damaging projects. Jean Lambert,

. – Mr President, my thanks as well to the rapporteur, not least for trying to push through a wider vision of what the European Year of Citizens should be about, rather than just focusing on the rights to free movement. These rights do need to be better understood. We know that they are crucially important and that for many citizens they are seen as the key indicator of equality within an EU setting, along with coordination of social security rights – maybe this is why certain governments and parties feel that to help make the European Union less acceptable they have to call those rights into question at the moment. As our rapporteur says, the EU needs to be able to answer the bigger questions about what role citizens are playing in decision-making in the European Union. The current crisis certainly makes many feel that they are on the receiving end of decisions made elsewhere, and that decisions are being made to suit unaccountable markets rather than individuals and families living with the consequences. Maybe one of the outcomes we should be looking at for this European Year is to have a real citizens’ charter. Jean Lambert  (Verts/ALE

 I supported the Rapporteur today in his proposal to reject ACTA. The Greens have been an integral part of the campaign to raise awareness of the problems we see within this Treaty, for individual rights and the protection of some of those most in need. Concerns about the draconian and disproportionate penalties linked to copyright infringement in the proposed Treaty are well-known. I am deeply concerned that governments and the Commission have put themselves in the position where ACTA is the subject of an ECJ ruling concerning its compatibility with Fundamental Human Rights. I am also concerned at the potential problems arising for generic medicines – essential for improved healthcare for some of the world’s poorest people. I look forward to future Treaties being given the same rigorous scrutiny as ACTA has received. Jean Lambert  (Verts/ALE

 I regret that the alternative motion for a resolution was not passed as it contained strong guarantees in relation to cloning and transport times for live animals. However, I supported the resolution which was eventually passed as it is a positive step forward. The EU urgently needs to address the effective implementation of existing legislation, not least with regard to the Zoos Directive, and Member States need to increase their rate and standard of inspection in relation animal welfare. It seems that many of my colleagues believe that high welfare standards reduce competitiveness: it is true that those producers who cut costs by cutting standards are a problem: they need to be tackled by making sure rules are kept, where they exist. But we also need to address the rules of international trade, so that methods of production can be made explicit and also used to ban low-welfare imports. Jean Lambert  (Verts/ALE

 I welcome today’s resolution on basic bank accounts, and the Commission’s response during the debate, as being important steps towards greater social inclusion. An estimated 30 million European citizens do not have a bank account and approximately 7 million have been refused access to one. While some may choose not to be within the banking system (and, given current events, who can be surprised at their decision?), many others do not have a choice. They then find it difficult to take out contracts for housing or other essential services, and may find themselves paying higher prices for domestic utilities as companies effectively charge a premium for what they view as ‘high-risk’ groups: the poorest are often hit hardest. I look forward to the Commission’s proposal on legislation later this year. Jean Lambert  (Verts/ALE

Madam President, I think that some of this debate is profoundly depressing when we are talking about how to keep the European Union out of human rights provisions. This is about accession to the European Convention, the European Court, rights for all within the European Union. It closes the gap which is there at the moment and which leaves EU legislation and actions outside the European Court of Human Rights. So the purpose of the Convention, the purpose of the Court, is that it requires governments to meet certain standards – just as many of us want it to require the EU to meet certain standards and to call governments and other authorities to account. Now there may be judgments from the European Court that we do not like. There are some that I am not too happy about. But the whole point is that it is not a pick-and-mix. You do not simply take those judgments that you like and put them into practice, while with others you simply say: I did not like the judges who made that. If you do not like the judges, argue for the reform and training of the judges, and then when you are making those arguments, also remember that a lot of court findings are against countries such as Russia and Ukraine, the very places we have heard complaints about. This is about the rule of law, within a human rights context; about how governments and other authorities respond to being held to account. That is something I want to see brought in for the European Union, not left outside. (The speaker agreed to take a blue-card question under Rule 149(8)) Jean Lambert  (Verts/ALE

 Maybe this would be an argument for actually having the European Union within the European Court of Human Rights framework? Then you could actually bring those cases there, could you not? Jean Lambert,  
on behalf of the Verts/ALE Group. 
– Mr President, I, too, would like to thank the rapporteur for the work that has been done on this. As has been said, it is a highly technical document, but it is an extremely important one for individuals within the European Union. As people have said, this is the latest update of what is – in many ways – one of the earliest pieces of legislation put in place by the European Union. It has been extensively revised – a job that we finished in 2009 – and this is now the update. Very soon, we will be seeing how the new electronic system that underpins this is coming into effect, and hopefully it will be able to deal with citizens’ concerns more rapidly. This concerns the maintenance of rights for people who move across borders for whatever reason or who work in border areas. It deals with the areas of core social security, health care, unemployment, pensions, family benefits, etc. It is extremely important that those rights are upheld. I think we have got quite a citizen-friendly outcome from this first reading agreement. As we have been saying, it is designed to uphold the rights of individuals who are covered by social security systems. It was not put in place to provide an opportunity for businesses – particularly those with mobile workers – to cut costs by providing them with an opportunity to choose the cheapest place to register their workers for social security purposes. I am very pleased that we have actually managed to close that particular loophole within this revision, because to find yourself registered in a country where you feel you have no connection and to seek health care treatment, for example, in the country where you are resident, is bound to lead to confusion and a lot of difficulties for the individual. Even though the company concerned may feel that it is doing a good deal for itself and its shareholders, it is not playing fair by its workers. So we are very pleased to have got the ‘home base’ definition in there, bringing it into line with other legislation to make it very clear to individuals exactly where it is that they are registered and therefore what rights they can expect. I think we have achieved a very good outcome, and we are very pleased to see it going through at first reading. Jean Lambert  (Verts/ALE
). - 
 Mr President, I very much welcome the opportunity, at long last, to have a debate on Nigeria. It is a major country, as we have heard, which is extremely important in the region and potentially internationally. I very much regret that the only way we seem to be able to discuss events in Nigeria is via yet another resolution which has taken religion as its focus. I want to respond to some of what has been said today. Let us be clear here that, while Boko Haram is the major force behind the violence, they are not killing only Christians. Muslims have died too. They have also assassinated Muslims who do not agree with them. However, there have also been Muslim deaths where Christians – or so-called Christians – have retaliated. We have also seen these events being condemned by political and faith leaders from a variety of different perspectives. It is very important to remember what has been said about what links this country, and not just what divides it. Yes, corruption is an issue. There is more that we could be doing. I, for one, very much welcome the recent trial in British courts of Ibori, a former governor of Delta State, which put him in jail. There is more that our own countries can do to deal with corruption. The people of Nigeria want a government that is fit for purpose. That is why, as we have heard, they were willing to stand for hours in the sun waiting to vote. However, I believe that the European Union, too, needs to change its relationship with Nigeria and that this Parliament should be strengthening its relationships with the Nigerian Parliament. Jean Lambert  (Verts/ALE
).  
– Mr President, we know that this is a difficult debate. It was difficult the first time round. Indeed, at that time, some of us who were in the House felt that the directive that we are currently discussing was too flexible and we launched a case before the ECJ concerning a couple of the provisions of the directive. Unfortunately, from the point of view of some of us, the ECJ found in the wrong way, but nevertheless it upheld two of the issues, not least about children joining their families. So while there are those who argue that this directive is unnecessarily lax, I think that we can see within the directive how we look differently at issues of flexibility. At present, four Member States covered by the directive are using it in a more and more restrictive manner, despite the rulings of the European Court of Justice. I think that is an issue that the Commission needs to look at. As someone said, the whole goal of this directive was in favour of family reunification as a measure of integration. Integration measures were meant to be part of the goal, not a barrier to family reunification. We know about people being asked to take language courses abroad when those courses do not exist and we know about highly restrictive costs in terms of coming to join family members. All of these measures are put in place to actually erect barriers. I believe, and my group believes, that those certainly need to be challenged. We are also hearing a great deal about issues of marriage and whether marriages are genuine or not. This is, of course, incredibly difficult to determine, not least when you look at the divorce rates of some EU nationals. But, nevertheless, there are ways in which we can deal with this. Some Member States already have legislation in place on issues relating to forced marriage, rather than arranged marriage. The EU has programmes in third countries looking at the empowerment of young women and girls and indeed trying to change family attitudes on the issue. There are also measures that you can take at interview stage to try to establish whether it is a forced marriage or not. I am really interested that people are so concerned about this because a number of us in this House want to bring forward measures looking at the question of forced marriage. We look forward to support from some unusual sources in terms of women’s rights on this. There is flexibility in the directive. We know that. As I say, we have seen ECJ rulings that have tried to put a limit on certain parts of the flexibility, but I think that, rather than looking to open up the directive, we need to ask the Commission what it has been doing in terms of infringement proceedings. In 2008, they said this directive was inadequately transposed and inadequately implemented in a number of Member States. What has happened since to improve that situation? Jean Lambert  (Verts/ALE

 I have voted for this resolution, not because I am enamoured of the content of the so-called six-pack (I voted against much of it) or because the euro is the way forward for all – it is not. I am supporting it because I want decision making on matters of direct interest to the EU to be taken within a clear legal framework and on a clear legal basis. I regret the British Government’s refusal to support concerted EU action and thus assist a push towards this new arrangement. An intergovernmental agreement can inhabit a grey zone, out of clear parliamentary oversight. We need clear parliamentary oversight: from both the EP and national parliaments, and this resolution states that clearly. The proposed intergovernmental agreement also sees governments stepping back from decisions made a few weeks ago, and this does not increase confidence or legal certainty. As the resolution clearly states, we need investment, not just austerity. We need a change of direction – towards a different future, based on reducing the gap between rich and poor and on new investment to help us work within environmental limits. The intergovernmental agreement is a distraction and provides no real solutions. Jean Lambert,

 Mr President, I think it is clear that for all of us the legislation that we are talking about this evening maybe is not the most perfect that we would have hoped for. However I think many of us see it as a positive step forward, and certainly analysis of it that has been done says that it may be positive in terms of integration for the many thousands of people affected by the legislation. It is a simplification in terms of putting together the residence and work permit as a single piece of paperwork. That, we know, was controversial, as well in the way in which it was discussed. But it should be a simplification and, as has been pointed out, there is a due requirement of time so that these applications should not be left sitting on desks as they so often are in many of our Member States. In terms of the rights section of it – which the Committee on Employment and Social Affairs was largely dealing with – I think we have made some progress there. The most important part of it is that we are looking at equality of treatment with Member State nationals in a large number of places, not least in terms of pay, rights of freedom of association and the right to educational/vocational training so that people are actually able to improve their skills base, which is for their own benefit and for the benefit of the company with which they work. The social security dimension is also important and I think that the changes that Parliament managed to make on pensions is one which we should be proud of. Jean Lambert  (Verts/ALE

Blue-card question

 Mr Batten, my understanding is that the UK is not actually signing up to this, so I do not quite understand what you said. Why do you assume that people are going to be flooding to a country which is not actually covered by this directive? Jean Lambert  (Verts/ALE
).  
– Madam President, I, too, would like to thank the rapporteur for this extremely comprehensive report, which I think should be compulsory reading for every Finance Minister. As my colleague, Ms Harkin, has just been saying, what we are seeing at the moment is a disconnect between macro-economic policy and the effect that it actually has on people’s lives on the ground. I want to respond to one or two points made by other colleagues this morning – it is a pity they are not still here. The bailouts are not charity. They are about solidarity, and they come with interest rates attached. The ESF itself is about solidarity, and that is why many of us in this House would like to see an increase in the monies going to other countries to help them combat poverty. In terms of the root causes of poverty, I for one do not believe that it is about a lack of opportunity. In some Member States where, for example, every job vacancy is being pursued by at least five unemployed people – before you even begin to look at skills mismatches and geographical mismatches – I think it is a little bit difficult to say that we are going to cut the benefits of people who have not found a job when those jobs are not there. Investment in social protection, as this report makes very clear, makes sound economic sense. It is an economic stabiliser; it helps recovery; it reduces future costs where we have to pick up the pieces of people whose health has deteriorated and whose educational opportunities have been lost; and it keeps the local economy moving. But I also want to see a reduction in the gap between rich and poor. That is what the ‘Occupy’ movement is about – the power of the 1% as against the other 99% – and that is why issues about a living wage and adequate income are essential in this debate. Jean Lambert,  
on behalf of the Verts/ALE Group.

 Mr President, my group would also like to thank the rapporteur and the shadows for the good cooperation in difficult negotiations. Whilst we certainly welcome the offence of online grooming being created, I must admit we found the attitude of Council in not wanting to incorporate grooming in all senses into this on the grounds that it already exists in national legislation a little surprising, given that many of the other offences here also exist in national legislation. My group, too, welcomes the inclusion for the first time in EU legislation of sex tourism related to children and the jurisdiction over nationals travelling for the purposes of child abuse, but we also agree with the Commission that it is a pity that we have not been able to find a solution on those enjoying habitual residence. We also welcome the recognition of the need to deal with the associated advertising and facilitation of such travel. We, too, welcome the measures to deal with the exclusion of convicted offenders from employment involving direct and regular contact with children. We welcome the move to make it possible for employers to request information about the potential employees for professional or organised voluntary activities with children, according to national law. Article 25 relating to websites was particularly difficult to negotiate, as has already been said, and obviously the priority must
 be to protect children. However, there are legitimate concerns that measures employed for this crucial purpose become co-opted for other purposes of state control. The solution reached in this directive is important and has the full support of my group. We also welcome support for survivors knowing the tragic consequences that such abuse has for so many children throughout their lives. Finally, we welcome the recognition, too, of the difference for consensual sexual activity between young people, whom we do not want to criminalise for behaviour that may be foolish but which is certainly not exploitative. Jean Lambert,  
rapporteur.

 Madam President, I would like to start by thanking all the shadows on this report, the staff members from the three institutions – not least my own office – the Presidencies concerned and the Commission for their interest, effort and commitment over the time we have been negotiating the revision of this directive. I would also like to thank the experts who have supported us. This year marks the 60th anniversary of the Geneva Convention on Refugees. At EU level, it is this directive which sets out the standards for qualification for international protection: for those classic refugees who have a well-founded fear of persecution – such as many of those who dared to oppose Colonel Gadaffi and thus qualified for refugee status; and for those at risk of serious harm – perhaps a teenage girl facing the death penalty in Iran for having sexual intercourse outside marriage, who could then perhaps qualify for subsidiary protection. As well as setting out such criteria, the directive deals with the content of such protection, such as access to healthcare or education. The revision of the directive is limited; it is a recast. The Committee on Civil Liberties, Justice and Home Affairs would like to have dealt with such issues as ‘actors of protection’, where the majority of us believe this should only be the state. That is why we have cited Article 7 as one we think should be looked at in the next review, as should the definition of ‘family members’. I also wish to put on record my own concern at the lack of change in Article 10(1)(d), where the cumulative definition of a social group was maintained by the Commission rather than being offered as an alternative. I trust, at least, that the ten Member States operating in the optional perspective will continue to do so. However, some progress has been made. The definition of a social group which could suffer persecution must now include due consideration of gender-related aspects. We have also included a reference to legal tradition and customs in Recital 30. We also include sexual orientation and, for the first time, gender identity. We should not expect people to deny their identity throughout their lifetime in the hope that this will make them safe from persecution. As concerns children – the topic of the last debate – Recital 18 lays down some principles, though not an exhaustive list, to help in determining the best interests of the child. This principle is also linked to entitlement to benefits. In Article 31 we have sought to improve the tracing of family for unaccompanied minors, across the asylum process. With regard to the content of protection, we have tried to ensure the same treatment for all beneficiaries of international protection and have achieved this in many areas, notably in terms of recognition of qualifications and access to employment. People want to contribute to the country that is providing protection. However, a few Member States have insisted on being able to maintain certain differences between the two groups. This seems to be based on the misapprehension that those at risk of serious harm will need protection for a shorter period of time than those at risk of serious persecution. Our fight – maybe I should say our debate – over the length of residence permits yielded a small victory. However, we would invite the Member States most concerned in relation to difference of treatment to reflect as to whether an annual consideration of status is a good use of public money, and whether it reduces administrative burdens or provides a better context for integration than a period of at least three years. After all, there is a possibility of using cessation provisions if a need for protection changes. To conclude, this revised directive takes small, but important, steps towards a common European asylum policy, but the system is only as common as the consistent high quality of its implementation across all participating Member States. We hope that movement on this directive will help provide impetus for the remaining measures and show that progress is possible. Jean Lambert,  
rapporteur.

 Mr President, I would like to thank all who have participated in the debate today. It is true that we have difficulties with our asylum system; we know that the results can be very different from country to country, and we are also aware that this one step forward is not going to solve all the problems – although we know that it will give greater clarity in certain areas and hopefully provide a stronger base for Member States to build on the good practice which exists in some and to share that with the others. We have heard a number of regrets. Well, we all have a few but, then again, maybe not too few to mention on this occasion. Certainly in terms of the correlation tables: yes, we would like to have seen those. We would have liked to see Member States being very clear about their implementation but, on the other hand, what I think we are more interested at this point is actually moving forward in terms of the content and the common asylum system. I think it says a lot that the rapporteurs from the other asylum dossiers have all been present tonight at this debate, and many have spoken. The willingness of Parliament to move forward is extremely clear, because this is a team effort. I thank people for their warm words, but this is a team effort and involves compromise and solidarity amongst us in Parliament to try and move things in Council. As we have heard, we hope that the movement on this directive – and I hope that groups will be voting in favour of it tomorrow (and maybe one or two groups might like to reconsider their abstentions) – will help provide impetus for the remaining measures and show that progress is possible, and that quality and consistency build confidence among the Member States and the public and deliver sound humanitarian protection for those in need. I think that is what we need to have at the front of our minds when we are looking at this asylum package. Jean Lambert,  
rapporteur for the opinion of the Committee on Employment and Social Affairs

 Madam President, let us hope that, when we come to review this directive, we can do it on a different legal basis. Our committee took the view that the legal basis should be Article 153 of the Treaty, as this matter directly concerns health and safety. We also underlined the importance of providing information and genuine consultation with workers concerning the safety case and safety assessments, not only of sites dealing with spent fuel and radioactive waste, but also as regards how these should be transported, and the need for a rigorous and effective inspection regime with sanctions that are effective, dissuasive and proportionate. We also want to see that all licence holders ensure thorough and ongoing training of all involved in dealing with these substances, including subcontractors – potentially a weak link in the safety chain – casual workers and all others working on site, whatever their job. We also took the view that there was no easy divide between civil and military waste, given that civilians may well handle military waste these days. Jean Lambert,  
on behalf of the Verts/ALE Group. 
– Madam President, I, too, would like to congratulate Ms Berès for taking the initiative on this oral question and resolution. I would also like to thank the Commissioner for his answer. It is all too rare that we get a very specific response from Commissioners to questions in an oral question. My group very much welcomes the proposal from the ILO for the Convention and the recommendation on domestic workers. We are aware that at least 20 of our own Member States have already commented on the draft and been actively involved in this. We look forward to early ratification by those Member States and, indeed, some interesting implementation. People have talked very much about how this group of workers is particularly vulnerable. A lot of the work is done behind closed doors; it is invisible. Often, the workers themselves are isolated, and access to trade unions is often very difficult in this situation. Quite often, if you are taken on as a live-in employee, you can be seen as being on call 24/7. We know in this House that on-call working is a very controversial issue and something that we do not particularly welcome. As has been said, domestic work is often undervalued, or seen as traditional women’s work that ‘anybody can do’, but we have also made the point that a lot of it is actually quite skilled. It can quite often involve nursing care and various aspects of child development. Domestic workers often occupy a real position of trust. While many employers value that, there are only too many who do not. For example, in the UK we have seen a recent case of somebody actually ending up with a prison sentence on a charge of trafficking for domestic servitude. The young woman involved lost four years of her life to her employer, who received a nine-month sentence. So we need to look at how we identify that form of trafficking. Migrant female workers are very vulnerable indeed. We have come across cases, for example, of workers entering the country with diplomats and having their passport taken away; people in that situation have virtually no freedom, have no access to assistance and do not know about their rights. I want to raise one issue concerning Article 17 in the proposed Convention, which is about the role of agencies. I think this is something that we really should be looking at at European level because, increasingly, it is being seen as a weak link in many of the issues that we are facing. Jean Lambert  (Verts/ALE
).  
– Mr President, I speak as Chair of the delegation which covers Pakistan, and I must say that some real crocodile tears have been shed here tonight by people expressing views which are about 180 degrees away from those they normally express. When we have discussed this issue here in the past, we have been assured by the Commission that the items in question have been carefully assessed to ensure they do not clash with EU exports. Has this changed? We have been asked: why textiles from Pakistan? The answer is: because textiles are a major export for them. You cannot expect them to conjure up something within a few months. We, too, had our doubts about the potential effect of this measure in the flood-stricken areas. We raised this matter when we were in Pakistan, and we heard directly from Members of Parliament there that the measure would be of benefit to industry in their constituencies, so I really think that we should consider the message we send if we do not support this measure. Jean Lambert,  
on behalf of the Verts/ALE Group. 
– Madam President, I am very pleased that the Commissioner reminded us that the overwhelming amount of movement in the region has been in North Africa itself. The UNHCR estimates that over 400 000 people have already left Libya. That is something that, having listened to the debate on the Procedures Directive earlier, some of our Members would do well to remember: the majority of people are moving within North Africa. We very much welcome the support given to the UNHCR and other bodies in assisting those displaced. A lot of concern, however, has been voiced at the pressure on Malta and Lampedusa, and quite rightly. It is significant, but not equivalent to what is happening in Tunisia and Egypt. However, there is growing concern about what is happening to minors – unaccompanied or separated at arrival. There is concern that they are not being properly supported or identified. We hope that the Commission will look at their situation and at the situation of those others considered particularly vulnerable at this point. We also welcome the willingness to consider using the Temporary Protection Directive. Could the Commissioner please outline what criteria she will be using in making that assessment as to whether to bring forward a recommendation? Jean Lambert,  
author. 
– Mr President, I think all of us have been very deeply shocked and appalled by the assassination of Minister Shahbaz Bhatti, not least because he is someone known to us in this Parliament: he has visited here, he has met many of us; but also because this is another highly symbolic killing, striking at someone who was looking for reconciliation and work across all minorities in Pakistan. We should also add our condolences not only to his family, but also to all the families of those who have been killed in terrorist attacks in Pakistan. This week, we have seen two such attacks, which have killed and injured more people than, for example, the London bombings. The whole population is suffering, and intimidation is undermining democracy in Pakistan. We are seeing a change in the demographics of certain constituencies, for example, Quetta, as intimidation works to force people out. Our resolution is important in terms of wanting to continue and support the work, in terms of tolerance and mutual understanding. I would like to make the point that we need that in the European Union, too, where certain recent ministerial statements, in my view, have not helped that. So we expect leadership in Pakistan and in the European Union. Jean Lambert,  
on behalf of the Verts/ALE Group. 
– Madam President, I, too, would like to add my voice to that of others who thanked our rapporteur for the very good work that has been done on this report. We are all aware there are national differences, as well as differences within our own political groups, and to come up with anything that gains a significant level of support is quite something. My group is especially pleased that the report before us recognises the importance of first-pillar pensions, the commitment to an adequate level, the issue of being able to provide a decent life. After all, we spent all of last year, 2010, dealing with questions of poverty. And, of course, this is also, for many people, a fixed income, an essential guarantee. Like others, we also welcome the recognition that we need to tackle decent pension provision here for women. We also recognise the importance of tackling discrimination against older workers and using other measures to help people stay in work. For us, too, the portability of pension rights is a crucial issue. More and more people are not working for one company throughout their working life. Indeed, they are working for several, and not always in the same country. And we need to avoid this fragmentation of pension provision, so there is an essential role for the European Union there. We are also pleased to see that this report contains a commitment for second-pillar provision, that it should be available without discrimination on grounds of age, gender and work contract. We would agree as well – and are pleased to see it there – that we need to be adopting more of a life course approach that deals with the different rhythms and patterns of modern working lives, both positive and negative. And again we recognise the importance of solidarity in that first pillar, not least for those whose working lives are involved with more casual labour, short-term contracts and so on. We are concerned at any effort to push third-pillar private pension provision and we agree that it is crucial that people have adequate and clear information. We would also welcome the fact that this report contains – if there is going to be a change in pension provision – adequate time for adaptation for people to reconsider their financial futures. Jean Lambert,  
author.
 – Mr President, I think all of us would want to express our condolences to the family and friends of Salmaan Taseer, the Governor of Punjab put in place by the government of Pakistan, and we are remembering here today his clear support for Asia Bibi – a position he knew to be controversial and indeed dangerous. We are rightly distressed by his murder and the reaction to it by part of the population of Pakistan, but we should not forget, as well, that many have mourned him and have done that in public as a public act. It is an act we should be commending, like, for example, the action taken by the media regulator against certain media with regard to their coverage of the alleged murderer. However, as we know, the blasphemy law in Pakistan puts the lives of Pakistani citizens at risk: Muslim, Christian and others alike, as many speakers have said this afternoon. We are aware that Pakistan is a new democracy, that it is facing conflict on its borders, and that it has faced the disaster of the recent flood, as well as the earthquake only this week. We know that the government is struggling, but we also recognise that it needs our support in terms of developing democracy within Pakistan, not least in the political battle against extremism and for universal human rights, and it is our role as democratic parliamentarians to support all those who are working for positive change and to give them the voice that others would deny them. We are also asking for action by the government of Pakistan, not least to remove the reservations on the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights – which they ratified with a large number of reservations – and we urged this in our recent delegation visit to Pakistan. We want them, as well, to continue the efforts to change the blasphemy law because this is a law that is more abused than properly used. Jean Lambert,  
on behalf of the Verts/ALE Group. 
– Mr President, many in this House will remember that at first reading, this was an extremely hot topic, and I think we are hearing only some of the differences between us. There were concerns about whether market forces would win out over services of general interest; and that people who were concerned about patients’ rights to choose, and to travel, were being pitted against those who were asking which patients would actually exercise that choice. I think what we have, at the end of the day, is a reasonable compromise. As people have pointed out, in cases where things are medically necessary, with a need for urgent treatment, we already have a system in place under social security coordination. This directive is more concerned with the market system, with choice, and with people’s ability to choose where to go, and to have money follow them. So we have clarity now, in that Member States can put in place systems to enable them to ensure that needs can be met. This directive should also be welcomed because it deals with issues around the legal dimension and legal certainty: with where responsibility for follow-up treatment lies; with the question of redress if there are problems; and with issues around ensuring that procedures are carried out by qualified medical professionals. On the issue of rare diseases, we have also achieved a compromise that is better than what we were pursuing first time round. As people have said, for many patients, this will work well, but we also need to take care of our patients in our own Member States. Jean Lambert,  
on behalf of the Verts/ALE Group. 
– Madam President, we, too, have a concern about the variable labour market that we already have across 27 Member States and within those 27 Member States, but our concern is how we move away from this towards something which is more comprehensive and stronger. We want to be sure that we have an agreed basis of rights for the majority of third-country nationals, as originally set out by the Commission and generally improved in the Committee on Employment and Social Affairs. We do not want to see these rights increasingly restrained and constrained, so we will support the widest possible and strongest range of rights in tomorrow’s vote. We want to remind the Council that we are concerned here with individuals who should be able to develop their skills and education, benefit from the social security contributions they make and look forward to claiming their pension entitlements, given, as is recognised in the proposal, that their work supports our economies and indeed our societies. For our group, the commitment to circular migration is also important in Article 11(a). The scope is a vexed issue because we have other existing instruments under discussion which, at times, come into tension. We are also fooling ourselves if we think that what is on the table here is actually going to meet the needs of each and every migrant worker within the European Union. We need a more nuanced approach to ensure that migration works for them, so we are not going to be voting, for example, to include beneficiaries of humanitarian protection. Jean Lambert  (Verts/ALE
).  
– Madam President, I just want to respond to some of the comments which have been made. What Pakistan is trying to do at this point is actually to help itself out of the mess that it is in after the devastating floods. If the factories were in flood-hit areas, they would not be able to produce, so it is not surprising that the factories concerned are not in flood-hit areas. The direct aid that could be put in is miniscule compared to what the need actually is. Distribution of the income from the additional exports is important – we know that for infrastructure, for energy supplies, for schools, for roads, etc. – while there are indeed responsibilities that lie with the democratically elected government of Pakistan in terms of its effectiveness, of income, of tax revenue and so on. People have also talked about the need for greater diversity. If Pakistan had a greater diversity of industrial sectors, we would not be concentrating so much on textiles. I appeal to Members to offer that country this opportunity to help itself out of this disaster. Jean Lambert  (Verts/ALE
).  
– Madam President, I think we are all aware of the importance of minimum income schemes across the European Union, although not all Member States have them in place yet. We also know that there are very big variations in effectiveness, that there is often no clear basis for the amounts that are paid, and that the amounts paid do not necessarily keep pace with rising costs. Some Member States have a very poor take-up, so people are not getting their entitlements, and some also time-limit these income schemes, which seems very bizarre for something that is meant to be a safety net. I believe very strongly that we need a common framework across the European Union that gives clear principles for how we develop these schemes and a clear methodology for working on them. We are not talking about the same level of payment in each Member State and to keep saying this is to perpetuate something which is deeply untrue. We do need to develop these schemes so that everybody in the EU can live in dignity. Jean Lambert,  
on behalf of the Verts/ALE Group. 
– Madam President, as has been said, what is happening in Pakistan at the moment is a real tragedy and will require long-term commitment on behalf of the people of Pakistan and its democratically-elected government for some time to come. I very much welcome the Commissioner’s response, and indeed her longer-term perspective, not least the link to climate resilience. I share the concerns she has voiced about long-term funding for such disasters. I think we would all urge the international community to intensify its response. We would certainly like to welcome India’s increased contribution to the UN fund, because that sends an important political signal. In our view, the international community could go further. It could release more of Pakistan’s own money by taking action to relieve Pakistan’s international debt, much of which was incurred under military regimes. In 2008, Pakistan spent USD 3 billion on debt repayment: this dwarfs the international aid effort. France and Germany are important bilateral donors. I think we should look with some concern at the repayment terms that may be on offer for the loans that are currently being put forward. I would also like to mention that I think it is important to have a similar response from within Pakistan, not least from rich landowners who could, for example, offer some sort of rent relief for poor tenant farmers who are not going to be able to pay their rent for some time to come. Jean Lambert,  
on behalf of the Verts/ALE Group. 
– Madam President, I would very much like to thank Mrs Lynne for the opportunity for us to be debating this tonight, and I welcome a lot of what the Commissioner has said. Indeed, I found quite a lot of it quite encouraging in some ways. You will have recognised, of course, that a number of our questions concern the issues about the vulnerability of older people and a very strong feeling that we have that it is crucially important that people can feel safe with those providing care. While I take your point about the issues about what is a Member State competence, nevertheless, the open method of coordination exists to help Member States work together on something which, while it is not a competence of the European Union, nevertheless is seen as something of common importance. I think certain of the issues, even about basic care, nutrition, etc., are very important within this. I am also wondering what further steps the Commission might take to persuade Member States of the cost-effectiveness of supporting informal carers. There are certainly figures from the UK that recognise that this is a contribution of billions saved in our economy, because the care is being given by close friends or relatives rather than by the state, and that in fact, investing in something like a carer’s allowance and support mechanisms for carers really is worth doing, rather than having people totally worn out, isolated and suffering their own health and mental health problems because they have been caring for hours without background support. I am also interested in what you are saying about the possibilities of improving the qualifications of carers. Part of that issue, of course, is not only that this concerns women, it often concerns migrant women, and therefore a particular sort of investment is needed. But our resolution also talks about the need for contracts to stipulate at least a minimum income, a minimum wage. I would welcome your comments on that. Jean Lambert,  
rapporteur. 
– Mr President, I am not sure that inspiration is going to be what is on offer but this is obviously a very controversial topic that many Members in this House were terrified to come and speak about, so those of us who are brave enough to be here must seize the moment. I want to start firstly by thanking very much all the shadows who worked on this report for their very active involvement and our ability to find a common negotiating position and act as something of a team. I also want to thank the two Presidencies involved – the Czech and particularly the Swedish Presidency – for their more open attitude on this than we have seen in some negotiations, as we were able to negotiate rather than feel we were there to do what Council wanted – well, sometimes anyway. So, what did we achieve? The aim of the common European asylum support system is to deliver consistent high-quality decision making for those in need of protection, and it really can be a matter of life or death for those in need. It is well known that the system is not delivered in a consistent way across Member States. Differences at times are so great between the best and the worst that there is a lack of confidence which can lead to those who try to deliver objective decisions feeling undermined by those who do not. And those who suffer at the end of the day are those in need of protection. There is also a very strong feeling from some Member States under particular pressure that there is a lack of solidarity from others, that their need for support is not given a real practical response. Under the refugee fund, there has been a funding strand for cooperation between Member States which has led to some positive developments, but it has also become clear that there are limits to this more piecemeal approach. The Asylum Support Office is therefore being set up to provide ongoing support to enhance a consistent approach and to provide active support for countries under particular pressure. Specific tasks are already being assigned to it via other legislation. The key points for the European Parliament during the negotiations have been the role of the European Parliament itself in relation to the Asylum Support Office, how to achieve greater solidarity between the Member States, and the role of civil society and UNHCR with the Office. The issues about the role of Parliament have centred around our relationship with the Director in terms of his or her appointment and ongoing links. We have eventually settled on the European Parliament hearing the recommended candidate, offering a confidential opinion and receiving feedback on how that is being taken into account. The Director will also present the annual report to the relevant committee – I cannot quite believe we had to fight for that, but still – and we can also invite the Director to report on the performance of certain tasks. The role of Parliament in relation to agencies is now a topic for discussion in the interinstitutional working group, and I am now a member of the European Parliament team on that – partly due to my experiences and a certain sense of frustration with the negotiations on the Asylum Support Office. As regards solidarity between the Member States, Parliament wanted binding mechanisms, Council wanted to entrench the voluntary nature of cooperation, and the final language is more neutral, but we do have an external evaluation of the Asylum Support Office to look forward to, which will cover the Support Office’s impact on practical cooperation on asylum. On the role of the consultative forum, there is a lot of real expertise available to Member States, and it seemed obvious to us that such expertise could be valuable. We know that some Member States have active relationships with NGOs, and we wanted as well to make sure that local authorities, which often deliver much of what is required under the common system, also had an opportunity to be included. So we are pleased to have been able to breathe a little more life into this body. In conclusion, we feel that the Asylum Support Office could play a very valuable role in developing a common system. We hope it will be of high quality – even if we could not quite get that into the final text – and help engender a sense of mutual confidence and support. I would also ask the Member States involved to be more open to what other institutions, elected authorities and civil society can contribute, because, while this is about cooperation between Member States, it is not entirely intergovernmental. It is a European institution we are creating. Jean Lambert,  
rapporteur. 
– Mr President, I would like to just take an opportunity to clear up one or two questions which have arisen, although it is a pity that some of those asking the questions are not around for the answers. Asylum obligations are clearly set out under international conventions which all Member States have individually signed up to. That is not the same as an immigration policy, and people really should recognise the difference. For those who are concerned about the money – if I may make a party political and national political point here – if certain of our Member States stopped creating asylum seekers from Iraq and Afghanistan, I am sure we could save a lot more money and indeed save people a lot more misery. As regards some of the other points which were raised, it is hoped that improving the quality of the system in certain Member States will be able to increase confidence between Member States and deblock some of the other parts of the asylum system, as well as helping Member States feel that there is support when they are facing particular burdens. As others have pointed out, while some of our Member States do have considerable geographical pressures on them from the flows which arrive, many of the over-burdened countries are actually not in the European Union at all but are elsewhere. I was very interested to hear a colleague arguing for additional support out there, in terms of the Asylum Support Office, but I am afraid I missed the amendments which he tabled on that topic. I also want to be clear that the Asylum Support Office is not there to determine status; it is not taking over the role of Member States in that field. All in all, I welcome the kind comments made by colleagues, I welcome the active involvement of those who have helped me very much on this report, and I am sure that we are all looking forward – or most of us anyway – to being there in Valletta when the ribbon is cut on the Asylum Support Office and we can begin work. Jean Lambert,  
on behalf of the Verts/ALE Group. 
– Mr President, I would like to move an oral amendment which would become paragraph 7a (new). It is signalled on the voting list and my understanding is that it has the support of the political groups co-signing this resolution. It becomes the consequence of paragraph 7. So the new paragraph 7a would read: ‘Hence, calls once again on the Commission to develop a comprehensive European Strategy for Roma Inclusion as the instrument for combating social exclusion and discrimination of Roma in Europe’. Jean Lambert,  
on behalf of the Verts/ALE Group. 
– Mr President, I would like to echo the calls that have been made for a comprehensive strategy here. As has been pointed out, we are now in the European Year for Combating Poverty and Social Exclusion, which we know is difficult in times of recession, and that is why we have been asking for social conditionality on rescue packages so that those who are the most excluded do not find themselves falling even further behind. We have heard already that the gap is widening, which is why our EU 2020 strategy also needs to take into account the need to reduce the gaps between rich and poor. The changes in the regional development funds are important. Local authorities, we would agree with the Council, are important because that is so often where discrimination is most closely felt, on housing and the specific needs of the Roma people there, on education, and on the police whose job it is to protect and not simply to criminalise, as seems to be the way in some Member States. And we want to see high-quality public services. Council will remember its recommendation on the active inclusion of those furthest from the labour market where high-quality public services are seen as crucial. We are interested to know whether the Council and Commission are happy with the absorption rate being shown for funds at the moment. I would also welcome the context change that was strongly put out by the Commission in terms of anti-racism and xenophobia, and would hope that every Member State government would commit itself to those ideals. Jean Lambert  (Verts/ALE
).  
– Mr President, Mr Barroso talked earlier on about wanting an ambitious strategy, and it is true that there are parts of the document EU 2020 which are ambitious, but certainly the greenhouse gas emission figure is not ambitious: it is pathetic, and it is not going to get us where we want to go. We should be looking at 40% by 2020. Of course, the issue is not only about climate but also about resource availability and increasing resource efficiency. There is a lot, as well, that we seem to have seen before in this strategy, not least about economic growth coming through more and more as a goal rather than an indicator. It should not be the goal of a strategy. The EU has many areas where we have tried to decouple growth from transport, energy use, whatever, and it has long been decoupled from jobs. So, can we please not talk as if, somehow, growth is going to deliver jobs? We also need to be looking not just at reducing poverty but reducing inequalities, because that has known demonstrable benefits, and we need to make sure that our financial institutions do not undermine the ambitious goals that we might put in place. Jean Lambert,  
on behalf of the Verts/ALE Group. 
– Mr President, I too would like to thank Stephen Hughes and Liz Lynne for their work on this and indeed to welcome this action, although we would like to have seen it earlier. As has been pointed out, the USA has had legislation in place since 2001. We can now see such legislation in certain parts of the European Union, and at last we are catching up, but, of course, not before many people will already have been affected by this problem. In terms of the risk, the World Health Organisation estimates that, while 90% of exposures to this risk are in the developing world, 90% of reports about occupational infection occur in the United States and the European Union. We know that there is a major issue of under-reporting sharps injuries: estimates range between 40% and 75% and that is huge. Therefore I think we should welcome the fact that, in the social partners’ agreement, clause 11 talks about the duty to report under a no-blame culture. But I think we also need to ask why people are not reporting. Presumably part of it is that they do not understand the risks or that they fear the consequences – not least, perhaps, to their future employment – of reporting such an injury. Indeed in some places we have reports of ineffectual follow-up, in other words, even where people do report, nothing very much happens. Certainly they are not getting even the medical support that they need, let alone the emotional support – or indeed, in some cases, alternative employment, if it is considered that, when they have contracted something like HIV, there may be a risk to patients. We have research which shows that health workers working outside hospitals are more likely to be dissatisfied with the response of employers. People have spoken about the scope of this action. Of course it covers the healthcare sector, and we are very pleased that the agreement covers trainees and subcontractors. I am not entirely sure whether that includes cleaning staff, and I would welcome some clarification on that. But it does not yet cover workers in other professions at risk, so we hope Member States could look at that. The training obligations are extremely important, and I hope Member States will take this seriously: both the giving and receiving of training should be mandatory, as should induction for all new and temporary staff – because I think there is a feeling that if you train people once you never have to look at that issue again. At the moment there is a lack of training even where employers have training policies in place. An issue was raised about the cost. There are estimates that training and preventative measures, including safer devices, account for about a third of the cost of dealing with sharps injuries. That is an important saving in cash-strapped times, as well as being an important issue both for the people concerned and employers, who may indeed find themselves at risk of legal action if they are not taking action to prevent such injuries. Jean Lambert,  
on behalf of the Verts/ALE Group. 
– Madam President, I think there are certain things to be welcomed in the action plan but, as colleagues have correctly pointed out, there are a number of questions there that have not been answered. I think that, when we are looking at this, we are always looking at it from the point of view of the problem that we have and sometimes tend to underestimate the daily reality for people in both Afghanistan and Pakistan of the many deaths, the targeted killings of the Hazara population, for example, in parts of Pakistan, the attacks on girls’ schools, on the police and so many others. The Afghan police were described to us recently as basically cannon fodder for the Taliban. I think many of us are still wondering, really, what it was that we ever thought we would achieve by going in. In terms of the international response, I welcome hearing the Commissioner talking about kick-starting cooperation and particularly mentioning India. The regional approach is important, and I look forward to hearing how we are going to deal with other areas of real tension, such as Kashmir, which the Afghan Ambassador told us the other day really provides a problem for everything that people try to do in the region. We also need, in Pakistan particularly, to be looking at what effective support we are offering in terms of the many thousands of displaced people, and learn from our lack of engagement with those who were displaced to the borders of Pakistan and Afghanistan in the past that a vacuum will be filled. Therefore, we really need to be paying attention to education and meeting the needs of the population who are also looking after those displaced people. Keith Taylor  (Verts/ALE

 Mr President, I speak with a request to postpone the vote on the maritime spatial planning item, from Tuesday, to allow for an accurate translation into Swedish. I am told that the existing translation is at best opaque and at worst misleading and incorrect. I am not aware of any problems with other languages, but that is not surprising. I have spoken with Ms Meissner, the rapporteur, who is in agreement with a postponement of the vote to allow more time for an accurate translation. I am sure you will agree that this is an important point. Members must be fully aware of the details and understand properly what they are voting on. So with that, I would like to formally ask for a delay on that vote. Keith Taylor,

 Mr President, I was the shadow for the Green Group on this. There was good technical harmonisation about connections, which was very welcome. I note average results from what I basically see as a fairly flawed regulation. Member States now have reasonable freedom to decide how and where they want to have the infrastructure and an extended amount of time to decide. The bad result is the lost opportunity to tie greenhouse gas emissions and pollution emissions to the alternative fuels. It is rather technologically blind. There is no reference to renewable energies or to public transport. We need to remember that we started off by trying to reduce emissions, but that does not really seem to feature in the ambition of this report. More could have been done, but the Greens will nevertheless support it from the point of view of technical harmonisation. Keith Taylor  (Verts/ALE
). - 
 Mr President, speaking as the Green shadow rapporteur on the De Backer report, we agree that any measures to improve road safety should be seriously investigated. The terrible death toll on European roads throws down a stark challenge to reduce deaths and injuries. However, our Group is not convinced that a mandatory EU-wide eCall system as currently prescribed is the best alternative. More lives could be saved, for example, if speed limits were cut by 10 km/hour. Such a policy would also be cheaper and would achieve real casualty reductions.  We have concerns about the possibility of the EU having to co-fund the system, about data protection issues, and the increased likelihood of false alarms through the automated systems. Finally, the suggestion that the driver of the vehicle should be able to turn off the machine seems to undermine and complicate the entire idea. My Group will not be supporting either of the reports.

 Mr President, colleagues, I speak to you today as the rapporteur on last year’s report on Regulation (EU) 261/2004 and Regulation (EU) 1008/2008 and also as the Green shadow for Mr Bach’s report today. I would like to thank the rapporteur for his very constructive approach, and I am very pleased to say that we have been able to change the emphasis in the Commission proposal from one which was largely pro-industry – pro-airline – to one which is much more pro-passenger, and that is the version we will vote on today. Although my Group’s view that compensation should be paid after one hour was not carried, a compromise of three hours was, and that also mirrors the European Court of Justice’s position of three hours as the trigger. So this is considerably better than the starting point of the Commission, which was five hours. We are also able to support the narrowing of the extraordinary circumstances to stop airlines hiding behind this excuse to avoid paying compensation to travellers to whom it is due. I am pleased to see the recommendations about better communication with passengers, and I also hope that implementation can be improved. In that regard, I think that our suggestion of independent mediation bodies will prove very useful.  Also, the environmental impact and energy efficiency of passengers’ travel will be provided on the website and on the tickets for the journey. We cannot expect people to be more responsible about carbon emissions if they do not know what the effect of their activities will be.  All in all I am very pleased to be able to support this report, and I would like to thank Mr Bach once more for his constructive approach. Keith Taylor  (Verts/ALE

 I supported this own-initiative report on Blue Growth. However, I regret that the report presents the view that the marine environment is only a section for consideration within Blue Growth, instead of presenting a healthy marine ecosystem as a fundamental prerequisite within which any other sectoral ‘blue’ policies operate. This disagreement with the report is a fundamental one, but I hope this issue is better addressed in other legislative proposals (e.g. on maritime spatial planning).  Whilst amendments which called for a ban on Arctic oil and gas exploration, and for ship emission limits, were not supported in TRAN, most of the report is fine, underlining the importance of key issues for the Green/EFA group: smart, sustainable and inclusive growth, based on an eco-system approach; using the precautionary principle to assess proposals; protecting sustainable maritime sea basin strategy and developing island and coastal tourism.  The report goes on to call for the development of opportunities for ‘clean ships’ that are more energy-efficient and produce less emissions, the construction of a North Sea Offshore Grid for renewable energy, more efficient use of resources and enhanced recycling policies (as an alternative to sea mining), and notes the employment opportunities this approach presents.

 Mr President, as the Greens’ shadow on this file I would like to thank the rapporteur, Brian Simpson, for his effective work. This was a standard procedure to adopt the Maritime Labour Convention (MLC) of 2006 into EU law and in so doing to secure seafarers’ rights and protection. We are going to be supporting this first reading agreement in view of the rapporteur’s call for non-regression. That means no existing standards of social legislation should be allowed to be lowered due to the adoption of this piece of legislation. The recommendations on non-ratification did not go as far as we wanted – our proposal wanted to put ships from flag States not signing the MLC into a higher risk category but this was not accepted. We did at least get an agreement that non-flag vessels would get ‘no more favourable treatment’ than ones sailing under the convention; in Article 3 of the amended directive. Keith Taylor,

 Madam President, the existing MDG framework has helped to galvanise development efforts and guide global and national priorities. Not all the targets have been met, but we have heard some significant targets have been met and that NGOs have found it very useful to have MDGs so that they can encourage their Member State governments to achieve better results. The current MDGs do not, however, sufficiently address the root causes of poverty, such as inequalities within and among countries, as well as issues such as social exclusion, biodiversity and governance.  We need a new approach post-2015 that embraces global governance, with a strong focus on policy coherence for development and the provision of global public goods. By that I mean understanding that global public goods will include international trade, environmental and financial architecture within the context of global governance. It is also important to have a human rights approach, and I am in agreement with most of what the report says. We need a more holistic approach reflecting the outcome of the Rio+20 Conference on sustainable development, and we need to develop the concept of development effectiveness: a combination of development aid, assistance for the provision of global goods and adaptation of governance structure. It is important that the global goals and targets are tailored and adapted to national and regional contexts. In conclusion, is important to say, with regard to recipient countries, that I am very pleased to see the Commissioner is saying we should stick to the 7% GNI target for overseas development aid. Keith Taylor  (Verts/ALE

 Madam President, the question from the Chair of the Committee on Transport and Tourism is timely and I suspect there is frustration behind it. There were no fewer than three separate reports which included reference to passengers’ hand luggage adopted in 2012. I was the author of the first report which concerned the functioning and application of established rights of people travelling by air and that report was adopted by a large majority.  Concerning hand luggage, we called on the Commission to propose measures which make it possible to harmonise commercial practice so as to protect passengers against excessive restrictions and to allow them to carry on board a reasonable amount of hand luggage. We have heard the horror stories of the travelling public; the Parliament has expressed its wishes. If I heard the Commissioner right, he is going to leave it up to the market and possibly the courts. I simply do not think that is good enough and I really want the Commission to respond to those three separate reports calling for a proactive action. Keith Taylor  (Verts/ALE

 I am bitterly disappointed that Parliament voted to endorse ACAA. I do not accept the disingenuous argument of the majority of the PPE and ALDE that this was a purely technical matter. It is clearly a political one. and this vote will send out the message that the EU favours increased trade with Israel over the welfare of hundreds of thousands of Palestinians who are daily subjected to a blockade of Gaza, illegal settlements on their territories, an apartheid wall and property evictions and demolitions. Trade can be a useful tool in development and peacemaking, but voting to accept ACAA is tantamount to endorsing the ongoing violations of international humanitarian and human rights law that Israel is inflicting on the Palestinian territories and people. Through this failure to provide consistency in the application of its fundamental principles, and only weeks after the EU was awarded the Nobel Peace Prize, Parliament is undermining its own, and the EU’s, credibility as a force for good in the world. It makes no sense. I will continue to contribute to peaceful settlement in this troubled region, and strive for justice for all. Keith Taylor  (Verts/ALE

 I did not support the vote to approve Parliament’s resolution on the 2013 EU Budget. Although there were measures within the budget I did support, the overall budget’s net increase of 6.8% over the 2012 levels at a time when states all over the EU are imposing austerity measures is something I cannot condone. I have previously voted to limit additional Member State contributions to the rate of inflation, and suggest a reappraisal of spending priorities for specific budget lines with any unspent money reallocated. Such funds could also be used to meet extra commitments resulting from new post-Treaty of Lisbon measures. A favourite area for funding cuts is the billions of euros spent on the ITER nuclear fusion budget. I believe this selective approach to be a more appropriate method for directing spending in times of financial hardship, rather than approving across-the-board blanket percentage increases. Keith Taylor,  
on behalf of the Verts/ALE Group. 
– Mr President, I should like to thank Mr Kazak for his report. The Greens appreciate that the Commission has come forward with this proposal for a general regulation on MFA. We have been asking for such a regulation for the last five years and now the question arises whether this proposal is still in time. Given that Parliament is about to start the revision of the existing financial instruments for the period 2014-2020, and given the limited size and importance of the MFA instrument, we wonder whether it might not be wise to integrate the MFA into the new European Neighbourhood Instrument from 2014 onwards. This instrument already provides for budget support and could accommodate conditionality. We would only need to integrate the MFA elements when blending grants and loans into the ENI framework, but this should be possible. For Greens this would seem to be the most elegant way to signal to our neighbourhood partners that we are still willing to support their balance of payments stability while solving the problem of how to make MFA more of a true EU structural adjustment programme. We sadly did not receive the support of the other political groups over this idea. Hence we will go with the rapporteur and we will be abstaining in the vote later on.

– I am extremely pleased that this report has been adopted, as it strengthens passenger rights across the board. However, in my original draft report, I urged the Commission to propose an obligation on air carriers to provide a final guarantee covering their liabilities towards passengers in the event of insolvency, bankruptcy or removal of an operating licence. The reference to a final guarantee was weakened at the vote in the Transport and Tourism Committee, confining the proposal to support for stranded passengers to be repatriated in the event of insolvency, bankruptcy, ceased operations or removal of an operating licence. Although I welcome this measure, it is not as strong as the original wording, and I call on the Commission to look into the possibility of proposing a final guarantee to protect passengers when they revise Regulation No 261/2004.

 Mr President, as the standing rapporteur for (sound disappears
), I am particularly concerned by the situation in Kazakhstan where, as we are hearing from many other speakers, fundamental rights continue to be violated. I find it completely unacceptable that, following his recent meeting here in Strasbourg with MEPs to discuss the tragedy in Zhanaozen, Vladimir Kozlov, the leader of the opposition political party, Alga, was arrested by the Kazakh Committee of National Security on his return to the country. Mr Kozlov, as well as other political opponents of the government, was sentenced and put in prison. More recently, I have also met with some Kazakh civil society activists, including Mrs Kozlov, and I was extremely concerned to hear that Mr Kozlov has recently undergone surgery while in prison but that his current state of health is not known. Nobody, including his wife, is allowed any contact with him. Journalists I have also met have been intimidated and threatened with arrest if they write anything against the regime in Kazakhstan. So I think we should call on the Kazakh authorities to end the clampdown on the political opposition and independent media in the country and to immediately release all people incarcerated on politically motivated grounds.

 Madam President, Parliament started to draft a resolution on this, led by the Committee on Transport and Tourism, for which I am the Green shadow. We recognise that maritime piracy is an extremely complicated and problematic issue, but we also believe that it is a horizontal one, incorporating development, security and foreign affairs aspects, while the link with transport issues is more secondary. I am given to understand that the reason why the Transport Committee is the leading committee is because the Commission’s Directorate-General for Mobility and Transport wants to lead on this instead of DG Development. Greens are completely against this shift, as solutions to maritime piracy do not lie primarily with changes to transport policy. Therefore, we welcome the fact that this resolution was taken off the agenda for this plenary session. If Parliament is determined to have a resolution on this, we think it should be led by another committee such as the Subcommittee on Security and Defence, as well as being better timed in order to tie in with the external work and developments. Apart from the fact that we do not think that the Transport Committee should be leading on this issue, the solutions in the draft resolution are not in line with previous Parliament resolutions on piracy, Somalia and the Horn of Africa. Furthermore, they are too militarily based. We are against further militarisation and strongly in favour of strengthening the criminal justice approach to piracy, as advocated by the United Nations Special Advisor on Piracy, Mr Jack Lang. This, ultimately, would also need a change in any future resolution from this place on this issue. Keith Taylor,

– Mr President, the end of the death penalty has been achieved in 96 countries across the world and only 23 countries actually carried out executions in 2010. To see any reduction in the numbers of legal killings is encouraging, but hearing about the possibility that executions in Japan will restart under a new Minister of Justice is a matter of great disappointment, both for me and for my political group, the Greens, who are completely opposed to the death penalty. According to reports from Amnesty and the UN Committee on Torture, most of those people sentenced to death in Japan have given confessions under extreme duress. That duress could include physical abuse or sleep deprivation or denial of food and water and the use of a toilet and not being told of the date of their execution until the day itself arrives. But the death penalty is not fail-safe. You cannot acquit someone if they have already been killed. So I think the death penalty is abhorrent and cruel; it degrades both Japanese society and morality and it further punishes the prisoners’ families, who are innocent of any crime. So please join us in voting for a moratorium and the reactivation of the Japanese study group to stop death penalties. Keith Taylor  (Verts/ALE

 I voted for this joint resolution concerning the 8-9 December 2011 Summit as it: suggested that financial and economic consolidation could be achieved through EU law, not Intergovernmental Agreements (IA) or EU treaties; recognised the draft IA did not reflect European Parliament (EP) priorities; supported a stronger role for democratic input from the EP and welcomed inclusion of a parliamentary working group and gave all EU members (including the UK) participation rights in discussions. The draft IA is still being developed, and already there are moves from Member States to dilute the fiscal requirements identified at the December summit (including the so-called ‘golden rule’). For the Single Currency to work there needs to be strong economic and fiscal union between Eurozone (EZ) members. I am not yet convinced that the EZ states will finally agree to necessary strict controls, and I am glad the UK is not part of it. I believe it is in the UK’s best interests to have a strong and stable euro, given that 40% of our trade is with EZ countries. For that reason, and the fact it was the only option achievable at this stage, I supported the resolution. Keith Taylor,  
on behalf of the Verts/ALE Group. 
– Madam President, I would like to take this opportunity on behalf of the Green Group to thank Mr Fleckenstein and other political shadows for the very positive way in which this report developed. There was much to agree on and little to dispute, and that was because we believe that EMSA is doing a very good job. I was particularly pleased to see three elements in this report. The first was an increased role for the European Maritime Safety Agency in the monitoring of offshore oil and gas installations; the second, increased preparedness to provide a response to maritime accidents; and the third, an increase in partnership working to deliver maritime surveillance, including the SafeSeaNet programme, hopefully linking up with some of the policies recently approved in our integrated maritime policy. I did attend an EMSA conference in their new centre in Lisbon, and I must say I was very impressed with the breadth of their operations and their commitment to delivering safety on the sea. I commend this report to you and thank Mr Fleckenstein. Keith Taylor,  
on behalf of the Verts/ALE Group. 
– Mr President, the Greens on the Committee on International Trade fully support the report’s position, which is calling for Uzbekistan to take concrete and convincing measures to eradicate child labour before the Parliament can give consent to textiles being covered by the Partnership and Cooperation Agreement. I think it is perfectly right that we should be withholding European Parliament consent to this Protocol with Uzbekistan until those breaches have been stopped. In relation to the textiles, there is clear evidence of state-sanctioned, systematic and widespread forced labour in the Uzbek cotton fields. Schools are being closed during the harvest period and thousands upon thousands of school children are being forced to work in the fields collecting cotton. This is not the treatment that any child should have to tolerate. We would not tolerate it for our children. Those children in Uzbekistan are our children; we should have a responsibility for them. Keith Taylor,  
on behalf of the Verts/ALE Group.
 – Madam President, the Greens support the measures contained in the Koumoutsakos report today, and welcome the opportunity we have for an agreement at first reading. It is necessary – as has been so eloquently pointed out by other speakers – to provide some interim funding so that proper allocations can start from 2013. As it happens, we were unable to secure the amount originally envisaged, but nevertheless there is EUR 40 million available from unspent budget allocations. That money will go towards integrating maritime policy around the development of short sea shipping, the detection of illegal fishing, the integration of sea-basin strategies and maritime surveillance and, importantly, protection of the marine environment. We have particularly enjoyed working with the rapporteur. We now welcome the opportunity to work in partnership with other agencies, notably the European Maritime Safety Agency with its SafeSeaNet programme. Colleagues, please use your vote later today to support this jolly good idea. Keith Taylor  (Verts/ALE

 I did not support the vote to approve the EU Budget 2012 resolution in the EP this week. Within the budget there were measures I supported, such as increased funding for the EU 2020 work, the greening of the CAP, and for Palestine, as well as reducing business flights and freezing MEPs’ daily allowances. However, the overall budget net increase of 5.3% over 2011 levels, at a time when States all over the EU are imposing austerity measures, is something I cannot condone. I voted in June 2011 to limit increases in Member State contributions in line with inflation, and suggested specific budget lines should be revised, and unspent money reallocated. I remain of this view. Keith Taylor,

 Madam President, I rise to speak in favour of Ms Koppa’s resolution. Like many others, I have witnessed the twists and turns in the quest for Palestinian statehood in the United Nations, and like many others I wish them well and hope for a fair and just solution. In speaking today on the Koppa report it is, for me, not a question of being anti-Israel or pro-Palestine. No: it is more one of championing justice and fair play. We must hope that peace soon comes to this troubled region. I spent a few days in the Gaza Strip this summer seeing for myself the abject poverty in which Gazans have to live. I listened to the pleas of mothers and fathers unable to feed or educate their children properly, and of doctors and workers who have to work with the most basic of materials. I listened to teachers and their students, refugees and NGOs, and I heard countless stories of stalled business deals, of jobs lost through lack of raw materials, of social breakdown and the strangulation of trade by the Israeli blockade. It became very clear to me that in Gaza and in the West Bank economic recovery and social recovery go hand in hand. We have some misgivings in our Group about the nature of the agreement, the dislocation of development in social and environmental protection, and some of the practical difficulties around identifying the sources of products. The Koppa report will not solve all the problems between Israel and Palestine; but it is an important marker along the way. As the rapporteur states, opening the EU market to Palestinian products is only the first stage in the construction of a Palestinian state. I urge you to join us in the vote tomorrow in Parliament. Keith Taylor  (Verts/ALE

Madam President, I would just like to say thank you to Dieter Koch for the way we have been able to develop these road safety ideas in shadows’ meetings. Halving the casualty figures is a commendable target. As has just been said, every single death is a personal tragedy for someone. I am particularly pleased that we have managed to tackle the three major causes of accidents: alcohol, drugs and speed. We have got here a uniform blood-alcohol level for the whole EU; we have a strong recommendation for 20 mile-an-hour zones or 30 kilometre-an-hour zones in urban areas; we have got safe routes to schools; we have got measures to avoid lorry blind spots. We all have a chance to improve road safety for all road users. Please vote tomorrow to make that happen. Keith Taylor,

 Mr President, earlier in this session we heard a moving statement about the tenth anniversary of the terrible attack on the World Trade Centre. The other anniversary is that of the start of the Doha Round of negotiations towards a trade agreement. I would say that this in fact has killed millions of people – the people in the greatest poverty – or shortened their lives. I think that if we look at the responsibility for that, we see that the WTO has not fulfilled its aspirations to meet the Millennium Development Goals. It has failed the less developed countries in its belief in free trade. What we have in this resolution today is recognition that the Doha Round is dead in the water. It needs to be concluded as swiftly as possible with a package for the less developed countries. We need to concentrate on multilateral agreements because every single bilateral or plurilateral agreement tends to put trade into smaller regional or subregional blocks, and this undermines the multilateral direction which this Parliament believes is the right way to go. Furthermore, I am very pleased to see that the resolution calls for a reform of the WTO, because it is simply no longer fit for purpose. It needs to be revised around the principles of democracy and – bearing in mind that the WTO has never taken a single vote on anything, as it is all done by consensus – it needs to have transparency and accountability. Our Group believes that the wholesale enthusiasm for free trade has ultimately not delivered the promised benefits. We believe that we should be basing WTO reform around trade justice and sustainable development, which should be the watchwords as we develop a new trade body for the planet. Keith Taylor,  
on behalf of the Verts/ALE Group.

 Madam President, this motion is badly needed. Even though we have the 2006 directive, it is plain that it is not working as well as it should. The companies we have heard of exist solely to swindle unsuspecting and sometimes over-stretched organisations, and I find that particularly outrageous when they are damaging community enterprises, often with limited budgets. Using tactics like those of bully-boys and racketeers, they dangle promises in front of unsuspecting people, but I think the message has got to be that if an offer seems to be too good to be true, then most probably it is. These companies are like predatory sharks and they should be stopped. Certainly, our group welcomes this resolution, it is very timely and we will be supporting it, as it calls on the Commission to require Member States to adequately enforce the directive. Keith Taylor  (Verts/ALE
),

– I will be supporting an amendment in the Multiannual Financial Framework (MFF) report which limits Member State EU contributions to the rate of inflation (currently 3.2%) or below, as suggested by the Heads of State of the UK, France, Germany, Netherlands and Finland. The MMF Garriga Report seeks to increase funding from Member States for the period 2014-2020 by 5%, and this I cannot support at a time when extreme adversity is being experienced in the UK from the government’s dangerous and socially divisive austerity measures. I do support many of the measures promoted in the report and in the Green’s amendments, particularly around the Green New Deal, the end of national rebates and Own Resources for the EU, and am mindful that part of the above-inflation increase is needed to meet obligations under the Lisbon Treaty. There are, however, many expensive budget lines remaining in the MFF that shouldn’t be supported, and I’m thinking of the EUR 6.6 billion to be spent on nuclear fusion as just one example. My argument is that if there isn’t enough funding after inflation-only increases in Member State contributions, ways should be found to re-allocate budget lines to meet any shortfalls. Keith Taylor,  
on behalf of the Verts/ALE Group. 
– Madam President, as others have mentioned, Canada is indeed a solid trading partner for the EU. The abolition of the tariffs now being negotiated in the CETA framework is, on the whole, acceptable to our group. But sadly, CETA does come up with some other demands and political goals which we find deeply worrying. I will mention two of the most troublesome, the first being the negative list in the negotiations on trade liberalisation. Normally, in negotiating FTAs, you name the services that you are ready to liberalise. But under these proposals, all services are open, except those specifically excluded at the outset. As Greens, we think there are some services, particularly those dealing with the general public interest, which are too sensitive and too potentially vulnerable to be negotiated under this ‘negative list’ approach. We have lodged some amendments and we are looking forward to some support from fellow Members. The other area of concern is around procurement. We are concerned about the impact that CETA will have on procurement. To give just one example, the Ontario Green Energy Act would be illegal under CETA. That Act promotes the production and feeding of renewable energies and directs investments into local economies. That is just one example of how CETA will interfere with domestic policy in Canada. Although Canada is one of our oldest trading partners, we cannot deny that occasionally, we do have differences of opinion. Canada is, for instance, opposed to the EU’s GMO policies. It is starting WTO action against the EU import ban on seals, in addition to its barbaric annual seal cull, and do not forget that it is fighting the EU Fuel Quality Directive to protect its exports of tar sands to the EU. I believe that it is important that we voice all these concerns and urge the Commission to remain firm in the principles and policies of this place. Keith Taylor  (Verts/ALE
),

 When we first heard in October 2010 of the Commission’s plans to help Pakistan recover from its awful flooding by removing some customs tariffs, Greens were enthusiastic to help. We still are, but a once-simple idea has become over-complicated and unworkable. Originally the scheme was for 3 years, although we wanted longer to increase investor confidence. But after various business and interest groups had got involved the proposal was reduced to 12 months only – with quarterly reviews! Further, any deal needs a waiver from the World Trade Organisation, which they haven’t approved as some member countries (notably India) are worried about the effect that duty-free Pakistani textiles would have on their own markets. There has been no progress in 5 months, and it’s unlikely we’ll see any soon, if ever. In Plenary today I supported an amendment to send the whole report back to committee for re-working. In doing so I wasn’t voting against helping Pakistan, but I was recognising the report before us simply wouldn’t deliver what Pakistan needs. For me, a major stumbling block has been the WTO. I believe this organisation needs comprehensive reorganisation into a properly democratic, accountable and transparent body. Keith Taylor,  
on behalf of the Verts/ALE Group. 
– Mr President, I, like many others in this House, share the concern for, and the sympathy with, the people affected by the terrible floods in Pakistan. I did so at the time and I do now. However, when I look at how the political will has been lacking, how the corporate interests have interfered and how the WTO has procrastinated, what I see before us are recommendations that dilute the original proposals put forward at such short notice by the Commission. Mention has already been made of the short timescale for the trade preference relaxation, reduced from three years to one year: Pakistan is prevented from maintaining or increasing duties or charges within that time. Moreover, it is proposed to seek not only an annual report on a one-year programme but also quarterly reports on the application and implementation of the measures. This adds up to a huge bureaucracy being created, only to come to an end within one year. So I have a great deal of sympathy with the proposal, which is Amendment 43, to send this back to the committee so that we can come up with something which will actually deliver the help we want to give to Pakistan. Finally, I think this really does point to the acute need to look at how the WTO works and to transform it into a properly democratic body whose proceedings are transparent and whose members are accountable. Keith Taylor,  
on behalf of the Verts/ALE Group. 
– Madam President, it is quite desirable to review the trading arrangements that we have with other countries and it is quite understandable that Japan sees the FTA as particularly attractive in relation to the recent Korea FTA. There is a lot that we can support in the EPP-ALDE-ECR resolution but I think that they are making a mistake to ‘strongly support’ an FTA. That is a direct quote from paragraph 2. I think that is premature support when we do not have impact assessments on the environmental and social effects of an FTA. They are predicting the answer before identifying the effects of implementing the solution. Many people have commented about the non-tariff barriers and the work that has yet to be done by the high-level group. I think that needs a positive step forward. When we bear in mind the importance of Japan as a trading partner – with bilateral trade with the EU standing at EUR 120 billion a year, and with the EU being the number three trading partner for Japan and the number two investor in Japan – I think we recognise that any bilateral agreement runs the risk of undermining multilateral agreements with the rest of the world and, in particular, with the developing countries. So I think that strong unconditional support for an FTA needs to be revised. Finally, I would like to say that, whilst we have every sympathy with Japan, future trade policies simply cannot be based on who has had the most recent natural disaster. Keith Taylor  (Verts/ALE
).  
– Mr President, I rise to speak in favour of the financial transaction tax (FTT). The FTT provides an opportunity to redress the balance and the damage caused by the austerity measures, the deficit and the measures adopted to repay it. It is important, though, to introduce taxation which is relevant to the current circumstances since, in the UK for example, Barclays Bank only paid GBP 113 million in corporation tax in 2009, at well below the UK rate of 28%, while the Royal Bank of Scotland allocated EUR 25 billion to tax avoidance schemes that year and cost the British and US exchequer EUR 500 million in lost revenue. In the UK, a group has been formed to support the FTT. It is called the Robin Hood Tax group, after the legendary figure who stole from the rich and gave to the poor. I support its campaign, and I urge Parliament to do likewise. Keith Taylor,  
on behalf of the Verts/ALE Group. 
– Mr President, I was the Green/EFA shadow for both the Saïfi and the Désir reports. We welcome these as important steps forward to secure better human rights and social and environmental standards in the countries that are our trading partners. If those countries want to sell on the lucrative EU markets, we should encourage them to adopt decent and sustainable standards at home. Securing improvement through mandatory clauses and requirements in trade agreements is one way to achieve this. Mrs Saïfi, who did an excellent job as rapporteur, discusses constructively the different levels and aspects of human rights, and environmental and social standards at differing levels. We agree with Ms Saïfi’s suggestion that a world environment organisation be formed and that the ILO status should be strengthened. We liked the sustainable development chapter in FTAs but wish those standards to be binding, not voluntary. Similarly, the GSP schemes should be given proper teeth and be enforceable. But we could not agree with the rapporteur that the human rights clause in the FTA with Colombia was satisfactory. In fact we thought that was a meaningless, formulaic human rights clause that makes a mockery of the aspirations of this House in that regard. Turning to Mr Désir’s report, we could not agree more with him when he names the transnational corporations as a source of negative effects on the environment and on our social standards. They have profited from trade liberalisation and they have exploited cheap labour – and, all too often, cheap materials – but failed to adequately redistribute the wealth they have created at others’ expense. We have successfully amended both reports, and will be supporting both of them when it comes to the vote. In closing, I would very quickly stress that more needs to be done in specifying the human rights and social responsibilities we want to prioritise. We should do so in terms of obligatory requirements and not rely on voluntary codes. Keith Taylor,  
on behalf of the Verts/ALE Group. –
 Mr President, on behalf of the Verts/ALE Group I would like to thank the rapporteur, Mrs Meissner, for drawing together this report and developing it alongside the other political groups. As 71% of the Earth’s surface is covered with water, it really does make sense to try and develop an integrated maritime policy. Europe, of course, has 305 000 kilometres of coastline. That was the Commission’s intent back in 2009 when it announced a more horizontal policy approach on areas such as maritime transport, the marine environment and regional and fisheries policies. Today we see the response of the Committee on Transport and Tourism to this fresh direction, in the shape of Mrs Meissner’s report. We will be supporting this report. It is a useful step in the right direction towards caring for, and the sustainable use of, our maritime resource. However, we believe there is still much work to be done. We welcome the report’s suggestions on maritime governance, on sea basin initiatives and strategies, on maritime spatial planning and surveillance, a maritime research framework and observation and data network, and a fund for maritime infrastructure. I am particularly pleased that the report now includes the integration of carbon emission reduction targets and support for renewable solar and wind energies on board vessels. When it comes to the votes later on today, I would particularly like to ask Members to support the rapporteur’s amendment which seeks to include the option of including emission trading schemes in the EU and IMO rules. This was an issue over which the Committee on Transport was evenly split, with 20 votes each side, so it is perfectly right that Mrs Meissner has brought it here today for plenary to vote on. I would ask Members to show some ‘20-20 vision’ and vote for the rapporteur’s amendment, which recognises that these measures sit squarely alongside our wider strategic objectives around CO2
 reduction and the Europe 2020 project. Keith Taylor  (Verts/ALE
),

– I voted in favour of a legislative proposal guaranteeing enhanced and extended paternity/maternity pay in Parliament today. I did so after lobbying from supporters and opponents. I am well aware of the financial conditions in the UK, which will be further worsened by recent budget announcements of more spending cuts. Nevertheless, the European Parliament was in favour of 20 weeks’ maternity leave at full salary, and 2 weeks’ paternity leave, and I believe that this is a sensible investment in the economy, helping reach the EU target of 75% labour participation by 2020. It improves the health of babies and protects the health and welfare of mothers. It is a step to close the existing gender pay gap. On average, in the EU, women earn 17% less than men. If we do not guarantee decent wages during maternity leave, women are punished in their earnings for having children. It is also a positive encouragement to increase fathers' involvement in caring for children. Apart from death and taxes, birth is the only certainty in life. Our children are the future and the improvements voted through today will provide a better and more secure start to their lives. Keith Taylor  (Verts/ALE
).  
– Madam President, I would like to add my support for this oral question, as I find it totally unacceptable for the United States, Canada and Mexico to be seeking to challenge the inclusion of aviation in the EU emissions trading system. In any event, many people believe those aviation conditions from 2012 to be modest in comparison to what we should and could have been able to achieve. For example, this sector will still be allowed to access carbon credits from other industries, and the cap on aviation emissions is nowhere near as challenging as that demanded from other sectors. Including aviation here is at least a step in the right direction, and ends the legislative vacuum it has enjoyed for too long, to the extent that it is the fastest growing source of carbon emissions. Surely the principle of the polluter pays has never been more well deserved than in this instance. In closing, I would say that we must not let established EU decisions be jeopardised by third countries. I urge the Commission and the Council to clearly state that they intend to fully respect the properly adopted EU law in the upcoming ICAO discussions. Keith Taylor  (Verts/ALE

 I welcome the decision of MEPs from across the political spectrum to support this strong resolution condemning Israel for its unprovoked and disproportionate attacks on the Free Gaza humanitarian aid flotilla. I understand that this was the strongest position that Parliament could adopt as a whole, due to differences in position between and within different political groups, and to have such a unified position sends a very clear and unambiguous message to Israel and the international community. Despite voting in favour of the resolution, however, I would have liked it to go even further. Immediately following the attack on the flotilla, I wrote to Commissioner Cathy Ashton, calling for an immediate suspension of the EU Israel Association agreement. Israel has consistently breached the human rights clause of this agreement and its latest move should not be tolerated. I believe that we need actions as well as words from the EU to show that the international community deplores both the siege on Gaza and Israel’s attack on the Free Gaza flotilla. I will continue to call for the suspension of this agreement whenever the opportunity arises, until Israel can demonstrate that it is upholding its human rights obligations towards Palestine.Caroline Lucas,  
on behalf of the Verts/ALE Group. 
– Mr President, let me say how delighted I am that we are finally discussing the Goldstone report in plenary, because it is a vitally important issue, and to date, the EU has been shamefully absent in these issues. It is quite unacceptable that the Council still has not endorsed the recommendations of the Goldstone report. The Commission says it is taking it very seriously, but that is not good enough: we want an explicit endorsement. The Presidency says that it backs it: well, it should back it publicly and explicitly and make sure that the rest of the Council does as well. Against that backdrop, I have to say I am pleased that in Parliament’s motion for a resolution on the Human Rights Council, which we will vote on tomorrow, we have two very strong paragraphs calling on the High Representative and on Member States to publicly demand the implementation of the report’s recommendations. The resolution further calls on them to actively monitor the implementation of the recommendations for consultation of EU external missions and with NGOs in the field, because the evidence we have so far is that neither the Israeli authorities nor Hamas are taking their responsibilities sufficiently seriously. In Israel, the investigations into targets and tactics used during Operation Cast Lead have been carried out by army commanders or military police, severely compromising the independence of the findings, and from the Hamas side there is still a failure to address adequately the firing of rockets into southern Israel. In the light of these failures, it is clear that the EU should put pressure on the UN Secretary-General to prepare a genuinely independent assessment. Finally, given the ongoing humanitarian crisis in Gaza, I call again on the Council and the High Representative to put far more pressure on Israel to lift the siege which is preventing reconstruction and exacerbating the suffering. Caroline Lucas,  
on behalf of the Verts/ALE Group. 
– Mr President, I would like to welcome the statements from both the Council and the Commission, but my question to them both is when are we are going to go beyond the fine words – which I very much agree with – when are we going to have real action? We have heard the same words over and again that we need to ensure that Israel does this or does that, but we need the real leverage to make that happen, otherwise Israel will simply ignore us, as it continues to do. My question is what practically can you do to make sure that we see real movement and progress here? To my mind that has to involve issues like the suspension of the EU-Israel Association Agreement. Focusing on the situation in East Jerusalem, I welcome very much the Swedish Presidency’s initiative and its clarity over the role of Jerusalem as a capital of two states and your firmness about the importance of Israel freezing its settlement activity in East Jerusalem. I also pay tribute to the authors of the EU Heads of Mission report on East Jerusalem itself. That report speaks with a clarity and vision which is all too often absent in these debates. It sets out how Israel’s policy of illegal annexation of East Jerusalem is deliberately designed to weaken the Palestinian community in the city and prevent Palestinian development. But the Heads of Mission called on the Council to adopt a whole range of recommendations as a result of that report, and I believe that we need to see urgent action from the Council to do exactly that. If the EU is serious about its commitment to a two-state solution, it needs to be doing everything possible to preserve and strengthen the Palestinian character and identity of East Jerusalem. The Heads of Mission statement and report show practical ways of doing so. Caroline Lucas  (Verts/ALE
).  
– Madam President, there is a new film on climate change called The Age of Stupid
. It is set in 2055 and focuses on a lone survivor of climate catastrophe. I am haunted by some words from that film, where the actor, looking back to 2009 – looking back to now – says ‘Why, knowing what they knew then, didn’t they act when there was still time?’ In other words, why have we failed to galvanise sufficient political will? Partly it is because we do not talk enough about the benefits of shifting to a post-carbon world – the millions of jobs in green energy, the better-insulated homes, the improved public transport. That is the message the EU must champion. Yet even the most ambitious target the EU is currently proposing – a 30% cut by 2020 – will give us only a 50/50 chance of avoiding the worst of climate change. If you were told that a plane that you were about to get on had a 50/50 chance of crashing, you probably would not get on. And yet the stakes we are playing for in Copenhagen are a lot higher than that. So my message to you is: please, be more ambitious. Do not let the epitaph for Copenhagen be that this was the Age of Stupid. Jean Lambert  (Verts/ALE

 Mr President, I trust our excitable friend is now lying down in a darkened room. I was one of those who negotiated the Return Directive. Certainly the section on detention was an extremely difficult one and I think that the results are not results which we should necessarily be proud of, but the directive is extremely clear that any detention shall only be maintained as long as removal arrangements are in progress and executed with due diligence. So that means that things have to be moving, people have to be informed of what is happening and if that is not the case they should not be in detention. The courts are clear on this, UNHCR has raised questions about the changes going on in Greece, but I think we also have some issues here in terms of the follow-up to the Stockholm Programme, in what we are doing that actually helps make returns sustainable in terms of preparation, prospects and indeed follow-up, to find out what actually does happen to people on return. We have reports – verified reports – of people tortured on return, for example to Sri Lanka and indeed other countries. I think we also need to be paying more attention to those who cannot be returned, either because of the lack of cooperation of the country of return or the situation in that country and of those who are actually stateless. We have to avoid deliberately making people destitute and potential victims of criminals who prey on the vulnerable.

 I think we have at least been able to talk to each other sensibly about these extremely difficult issues over the past. As a political group, we have problems with the readmission agreements, particularly when they are linked to questions of trade, because the readmission agreement is about individuals – human beings – and how we actually treat them. In terms of an integrated approach, I think you are right. The European Union is very good at having a sort of piecemeal approach, but it has not looked at how these approaches actually work together, either for the benefit of the individuals concerned, or indeed for that of the societies in which they are moving.

 Madam President, I would like to start by paying tribute to our rapporteur on this topic. Ria Oomen-Ruijten is very well known in this House – and indeed outside it – as a champion of the rights of cross-border workers. She will be sorely missed in Parliament in the future. I thoroughly agree with her when she talks about the need for those taking up the right to free movement not to be penalised, and to be able to maintain occupational pension rights. But we have seen the difficulties caused by long vesting periods and the implications this also has for age limits on cross-border transfer. We have also seen the irony – I remember from one all-party group meeting on pensions in this House – of the pensions expert addressing us being somebody who, because of his work patterns – two years here, three years there in particular Member States – had actually no acquired occupational pension rights whatsoever. What we have on the table here, while it is certainly not what many of us might have wished for, is nevertheless better. It is better in terms of the age dimension, the shorter vesting period and informed consent – the information that workers have to have – and certainly fairer in terms of the treatment of dormant rights. It has taken us a long time to get to this point. I think many of us would hope that we will see greater possibilities for transferability from one pension scheme to another – being able to take cash across and actually pay it into another scheme so that we avoid this kind of chopping, this fragmentation into different schemes. Nevertheless I think what we have before us is welcome, and about time too. Jean Lambert,  
on behalf of the Verts/ALE Group

 Mr President, I too would like to thank the rapporteur and others who have worked on this. It is true that when we are looking at issues around unemployment, questions about quality and information coming from the administrations have a really important role in this. This has a real impact on people’s lives. We should remember that access to high-quality public services is a strong part of the active inclusion agenda, so it is right that we learn from each other’s experience and really benefit from that. I think that the involvement of all Member States is extremely important and, frankly, I find that the arguments that we have been having over this have been totally dispiriting. We have made a turf war out of something which really should be common sense, namely that we do need to be developing the experience and to be giving people a better experience, whether that is dealing – as people have mentioned – with the Youth Guarantee and youth employment or questions about long-term unemployment and also particularly in relation to vulnerable groups. I think we all believe that cooperation with relevant stakeholders will also add something to this network. That will include not only the regional and local employment offices but also organisations which, for example, represent the unemployed and vulnerable workers. So we hope that we can get over this hiccup at the start and move on to have something that is going to be very constructive. Jean Lambert  (Verts/ALE

 I abstained on the final vote as regards this report for a number of reasons. The large number of separate and split votes, conducted at speed, means there are points where the text is probably no longer coherent with itself. In order to be coherent with my own vote on the Honeyball report at the last Strasbourg session, I find it difficult to support the outcome here. While there is much to support in this report – the need for the Council to break the deadlock on the Maternity Leave Directive, an ongoing commitment to access to care for undocumented women, a repetition of the EP’S commitment to gender budgeting to name but three examples – there were other points which were rejected and mean we left out important issues. I find it difficult to believe that the EPP voted against the right of women to be mothers and workers, or that the EP rejected the need to mainstream gender equality in our work with developing countries. I believe we need to rethink how we approach these reports in the face of determined, regressive attitudes coming from a section of the EP. Women’s rights and progress can no longer be taken for granted. Jean Lambert  (Verts/ALE

 Mr President, I too would like to thank the rapporteur and the shadow rapporteurs for the work done on this. We have heard mentioned today the checks and balances which are supposed to be there in terms of oversight of security services. It has become clear yet again, for those of us who remember ECHELON, that these are not operational or are being ignored, or that they certainly need changing, to move away from deference to security agencies and the light-touch approach. We have laws in place to limit general phishing expeditions, and we know that there are real questions about the efficiency of mass information. But the relevant checks and balances are clearly not operating, and we have governments making new powers out of vague laws. This working-round: what is on-shore, what is offshore, what is foreign? ‘If I hand you this bit of information and you hand me that about our respective citizens, well, we are legally OK, but we are not actually within the spirit of the law. Another question that is raised here is the inclusion of private companies acting within the state security services. What is the protection for the workers, and what are the rules under which they operate? Finally, I really think that if we are simply looking at a nice diplomatic, cosy chat with the United States as a result of this, it makes you wonder what has to happen before we actually take some definitive action. Jean Lambert  (Verts/ALE

 Mr President, I would also like to concentrate on the Gutiérrez Prieto report. When our committee decided our position on that, we were very pleased to support the report. It emphasises the social mess that we are in because of the way the crisis has been handled. We have heard about increasing unemployment and increasing poverty. Marian Harkin spoke very movingly on that subject, and it is clear that, at the moment, it looks as if we have no hope in hell of achieving the EU 2020 goals by that date. This does not mean we should walk away from the targets, of course. We are also very pleased that the demand for an interinstitutional agreement has not been included in this report. That discontent about the lack of democracy, about the real influence of this House – as the people’s representatives – on the Annual Growth Survey and on the country-specific recommendations, is broadly felt here, and in our view a Treaty change is not needed to have this interinstitutional agreement. Our feeling is that the Commission and Council should be grabbing this with both hands. I would really like to ask their representatives here whether they are going to take action on the issue and start negotiating such an agreement or not? It is also clear that, if we want the EU 2020 process, the Semester, to have democratic legitimacy, we need to involve civil society and social partners much more strongly.  At the European level, we have seen a coalition of civil society organisations working very hard over the last few years to gain a meaningful role, and with some success.  But we need to see this embedded structurally into this whole process – at national level too. In the UK, we have seen civil society social partners really squeezed out of the process since the change from the past coordination method. We really need to feel that people are on board with this process to actually have a say and to shape it. Jean Lambert,

 Mr President, I should like to say on behalf of my group that we very much welcome the proposals in Parliament’s response on this particular issue. I think a number of us will have met or heard from students, from researchers, who have been hit by the current difficulties, who do not get a reply on time to their applications where the research grant is running out and who will then find themselves in a situation where they cannot take up the offer, which is a problem for them and their working lives. It is also a problem, of course, for the research institutes, the research bodies that thought this was the best person to come in and help their research. We also very much welcome the introduction of the cross-border element in this. We are seeing more and more research being conducted in the European Union across borders. It seems only right that those people conducting that research should also be able to move in order to make the most of the possibilities of what it is they have come to do.  We were concerned that we did not, in this proposal, go back over some of the rights which are already there, for example in terms of family reunification for researchers, and we very much welcome the extension of this to students. We are also pleased to see the increased possibilities for volunteering. I think we need to see this as part of a lifelong learning experience, an experience in terms of capacity-building and indeed in terms of learning from those coming to us for those opportunities; the greater clarity and protection for au pairs is something we also welcome in this proposal.

I sometimes wonder if people have read the report. The Third World was referred to, and I am sure the Member will know the major countries that actually supply researchers and university students to the European Union at the moment. So I am sure that Mr Brons will inform us as to which of the countries are sending the largest number of students and researchers at the moment. Jean Lambert  (Verts/ALE
). - 
 Mr President, as we have heard, my Group also welcomes the Directive and the work of the rapporteur and the negotiating team, and we thoroughly agree with what has been said about the importance of decent work. I would also like to explain to my confused UK colleague that the UK is actually not signing up to this Directive, so some of what was said simply does not apply in this case. But in terms of the important sectors of the workforce listed here, one of which is agriculture, we go to a lot of effort to produce food in the European Union and we are rightly concerned about food waste, yet we have seen a situation where it can be left to rot in the fields because we cannot get a local workforce necessary to complete the harvest. That applies even in some Member States with high unemployment rates and high regional rates. As people have said, there is a long-standing concern here about the conditions for workers in seasonal work, whether EU nationals or third-country nationals. The risk of exploitation, the lack of effective inspection and redress and, at times, an unclear migration status are also a barrier to protection. This gives that clear set of social rights – including accommodation, which has been a major issue and where we have seen people expected to live in horrendous conditions and then charged effectively the whole of their income for it. Like others, we would like to have seen more within this Directive, but we think it is important for the possibilities and the protection it offers. We look forward to its full and effective implementation. Jean Lambert  (Verts/ALE

Mr President, I am very pleased that we have been talking about many of the rules this afternoon, because I think that, for a number of us in our Member States, the way in which this debate is conducted is as if there are no rules and no regulations. People turn up, and from day one – hallelujah! – the money is showered upon you and you do not have to anything for it. This is a total load of lies and an absolute misrepresentation, but of course it suits some to have a fact-free zone, because facts can be very uncomfortable. Yes, there is evidence that there are problems. Looking at the citizenship reports from the European Union that the Commission has produced, we know that there is a lack of information for people when they move about how things work, what their entitlements are and how they actually fit into systems. We know there is a lack of information about rights, such as rights at work. These are the sort of things that allow the exploitation of people. This is why we discussed labour inspection this week, partly as a direct response to some of the issues that have arisen through people moving within the European Union. We should deal with those difficulties, and we should also deal with the gaps that there are in protection. But the principle is clear. If you move, there is equal treatment with the nationals of the state that you are in. This means that if you are contributing, you have entitlements. And I am really concerned about some of the actions calling into question the entitlements of people who have contributed to a system, so that they are actually going to get nothing for something – the opposite of what is often said.

Mr President, we would very much like to thank the rapporteur, Kinga Göncz, on the rights, equalities and citizenship dossier for the very close cooperation we enjoyed from our committee. For us, one of the issues that we wanted to raise was certainly in terms of anti-discrimination. We know that we have the legislation on the statute books – much of it directly, of course, relevant to employment – but we know that in the world of work itself there is still a lot of work to be done in terms of a real understanding of what equalities mean: for those whom we are serving, but also for our colleagues.  Certainly in terms, for example, of disability we know that at the moment it is virtually impossible for people with disabilities to really be fairly treated in the workplace. So that was a major issue for us. Also in terms of data protection: how that will affect people in the workplace directly was of course an area of concern. But I was also working on this for my political group and there I think that, given that it is International Human Rights Day, talking about this programme is extremely important. We welcome it but, as people have said, it is modest; it is in many respects a small programme which is having to deal with very big tasks. We know too that hate speech is on the increase, whether that is against people with disabilities, or people of a different skin colour or background or sexual orientation.  So we really want to see some work done on that. We know that a lot of the national organisations which exist under the current legislation are seeing their budgets dramatically cut. We know that Equinet too is important in this role and therefore we really want to see some work done on promotion and delivery on very strong issues of anti-discrimination. As has been said, this also encompasses the old Daphne programme and again organisations are seeing their support cut at the moment but domestic violence is increasing at a time of crisis. So we want to be able to continue the ground-breaking work that we have seen in a number of places from organisations working on these issues.  Childrenʼs rights, of course, come in as a newer dimension. We know from other work we have done in this Parliament about the difficulties, for example, in providing real legal guardianship for children within the European Union. So we can see that this programme might well also be able to help deliver something very positive for our children. Jean Lambert  (Verts/ALE

I voted against both of the alternative motions to this report. I find it deeply hypocritical that we are willing to engage in supporting these vital services to those in other parts of the world but are not willing to consider their role in our own Member States. There was much lobbying on the original report and much of that lobbying was either ill-informed or deliberately misleading and sensationalist. This Parliament has, rightly, spent time legislating to protect children and young people from abuse, but they need to know how to protect themselves and that is why sex education is important. No one has been advocating abortion as a form of contraception – indeed, it is often a failure of contraception which raises the issue. However, we know from years of experience that the availability of safe abortion is better than the backstreet alternative. No one in this House has advocated compulsory termination of pregnancy, yet those of us who wished to support the original Committee on Women’s Rights report have been accused of that. I believe the success of the EPP/ECR motion is a retrograde step for this House – hence my vote against their motion. Jean Lambert  (Verts/ALE

I voted against this report, which contains many good proposals, as Amendment 62 on Article 9 was narrowly defeated. This concerned the banning of trawling and gillnets below a depth of 600 metres, thus protecting deep-sea species. Deep-sea environments are increasingly ecologically fragile: things happen slowly there due to the cold and lack of light, yet they are ecologically diverse. Disruption of that environment means it takes a long time to recover – just as high-mountain environments take a long time to recover when they are damaged. Deep-sea trawling trashes the environment necessary for ecological diversity, creating long-term damage for a short-term return. This House has missed a valuable opportunity to further help the marine environment (which is increasingly under threat from climate change) by deferring a decision to stop deep-sea trawling. Hence my decision to vote against this report. Jean Lambert,

Mr President, as others have said, the 2008 elections in Bangladesh saw real progress. The concern many of us have here is that the next election should not go back on what was a very positive election, where all parties could actually accept the results. There are issues about the interim arrangements. On our last delegation visit there – I chair that delegation – we made it very clear that we felt that interim measures had to be put in place well in advance and agreed well in advance, and of course that has not happened. This is part of the problem that we are now seeing, with parties that did not originally like the caretaker government now wanting it, and those that did like it originally now having overseen its removal from the constitution. We are talking about the confidence of all parties in an interim measure. The problem, of course, is that there is no confidence between the leaders of the two main parties. This is why the people of Bangladesh find themselves in a difficult position. We would all agree that we want to see as wide a choice as possible in those next elections. That is what the people of Bangladesh want. That is what they deserve. There is a vibrant civil society in Bangladesh. We are really concerned at the moment that what we are seeing is a bit of a clampdown on some of those who dare to criticise some of the things happening there. We would call, therefore, for those who are currently being charged to be released and to be allowed back into civil society. Jean Lambert  (Verts/ALE

Mr President, people have spoken about their areas. London, which I represent, is home to one million EU nationals, and many will tell you that one of the problems is a lack of awareness of rights, not people abusing them. Also, free movement is one of the most popular rights of the European Union, which may explain why certain people are so busy attacking it at the moment. I wanted to say a couple of words about coordination of social security, given that I worked on that for 10 years in this Parliament. It is about the same rights as nationals; it is about the same qualifying periods as nationals; it has been the practice for years – possibly the sixth piece of legislation ever put in place by the European Union – and the current rules were passed by unanimity in Council. We have heard a lot about why people move. It is not just about salaries, when they take that into account – it is also the cost of living. So do not assume that a higher salary automatically means that people get a better quality of life if they choose to move. Jean Lambert,

Mr President, I am speaking also as a trustee of Solidarity Network in the UK and chair of the Delegation for South Asia, which covers a number of the countries concerned.  I obviously want to support what my colleagues have said about the need to oppose caste-based, descent-based discrimination and that no-one should have to change their faith to be accepted in society, no-one should be refused water in a disaster because of their caste and everyone should be able to benefit from education and use their talents. Particularly, in the week when we celebrate International Day of the Girl Child, I think this has a particular relevance for the Dalits. We have seen recent legislation in Nepal which has challenged discrimination. We have seen EU projects there which have made an enormous difference but, as people have said, unless this is taken up and becomes part of a real cultural shift, all we are doing is supporting some people. This is extremely valuable and shows what it is we are trying to do, but we need to have these rights entrenched, not just in the Constitution, but in implementation in the law. We also need to look at our own Member States. The UK has recently brought caste discrimination into its anti-discrimination legislation, but we are seeing deliberate moves by a particular Home Office minister to prevent the implementation of that change. So this is something we need to be aware of in our own countries, as well as in the values that we promote internationally. Jean Lambert  (Verts/ALE

I voted in favour of the final report, although I have many reservations. However, we need to improve the current situation. This report provides the bare minimum: we voted to include Indirect Land Use Change (ILUC) factors reflecting the climate impact due to displacement of food production of different feedstocks on greenhouse gas accounting from 2020, and adopted a cap of 6 % on land-based biofuels including energy crops as a safeguard for 2020. My Group opposed the 10 % biofuels target when it was first proposed, but found no majority in the EP. We have now seen the damage that the current target is doing in terms of removing land for food production and transferring its use to fuel production. I deeply regret the attitude of some Members, who have sought to weaken the Commission’s proposal and who now seek to delay agreement with a view to weakening Parliament’s position and doing in negotiations what they could not do in the vote. Jean Lambert  (Verts/ALE

– I voted against this report. Not a single proposal from the Committee on Employment and Social Affairs was taken on board: there is nothing that seems to imply that the Services Directive has done anything that might be negative. ‘Only open up our markets and jobs and prosperity will follow’ seems to be its message. This House would not even confirm its previous position, enshrined in the Directive, to preserve the exclusion of welfare services from its scope. Overriding reasons of general interest must be available to local authorities if they are to be able to develop their local economy. I also deeply resent being told that if I vote against this Directive, I am voting against jobs – especially when the report contains no analysis of the effect of the Directive on job loss or job quality. There is much we can do to create employment but a blind faith in opening up markets and further competition does not amount to a job creation strategy. Jean Lambert,

Mr President, I want to start by warmly thanking colleagues from the different political groups who have worked on this report with me in an extremely constructive atmosphere. I also want to thank the many individuals and organisations – whether professional associations, non-governmental organisations or voluntary bodies – that have provided their direct experience and evidence about what is happening on the ground at the moment in our Member States to those who are particularly vulnerable. We have tried to reflect their voices in this report and provide some ways forward. We take as our starting point the declaration that all human beings are born free, with equal dignity and equal rights, and we believe that it is the responsibility of Member States to promote and guarantee those rights. We are also saying that the fundamental values of the European Union should be respected even in a crisis situation, and access to care, healthcare and social assistance should be seen as a basic right for all within the European Union. We know that times are hard in many countries, but we have also heard how political choices are making things harder. We have heard much in this Parliament about the dire situation of young people without employment. Yet some Member States stop health insurance after a certain period of time out of work. It is the European Year of Citizens, yet some Member States are making it more difficult for EU nationals to access healthcare to which they are entitled. The EU has a Roma strategy, yet we still have many examples of prejudice affecting access to healthcare despite the existing EU legislation. The Parliament welcomed the Commission recommendation on children and the recognition of the need to invest in early years to enhance life chances, yet we are seeing an increasing number of children taken into care linked to family poverty, and others going without basic vaccinations. Rising costs, falling income and cuts in services make it difficult to maintain the preventative services to which our governments have signed up, and we are storing up longer-term problems. We heard about those providing and receiving care: many of them informal carers, many becoming a vulnerable group in themselves. People with disabilities told us that not only are some places going back to old models of institutional care rather than supporting independent living, but the levels of hate crime against people with disabilities are rising as they are increasingly viewed as burdens. They are not the only groups now experiencing harassment or even violence. So the list of problems is long, but we also try to look at some solutions. Some are straightforward, such as the provision of accurate and understandable information. Tackling discrimination and extending the legal framework at EU level would also be seen as useful. But we have also called for Member States to carry out social impact assessments on austerity measures and to address the shortfalls. The Commission and Member States, in cooperation with all relevant stakeholders, and that means vulnerable people themselves, should monitor and address – that is the active part in national reform plans – which policies run counter to the EU’s 2020 poverty reduction targets. We want the Commission to include social safeguards protecting care and social services and social protection systems in agreements with countries in receipt of financial assistance. Many of us find it incredible that that has not already been done. We want to see support for carers and are asking the Commission to bring forward proposals for a carers’ leave directive. A social dialogue for the care sector could also help raise standards for the workforce. There are many other proposals in our report and I am sure we will hear those in the debate this morning. Once again, I thank colleagues for their very active input and support in this important issue. Jean Lambert,  
rapporteur

Madam President, my thanks to colleagues who have taken part in today’s discussion. I think we have a great deal of consensus here. I just want to reiterate certain of the points, such as the issue of the social impact assessment of cuts that have been made. I think this is coming through as something which people feel is extremely important. I know that it was said that it was almost as if we were demanding of Member States that they do additional homework that we should not be asking them to do. Well, in my earlier life I was a teacher, so maybe I am used to asking people to do homework, but it is also the fact that our Member States have signed up and made a number of commitments.  It was pointed out that they signed up to the UN Convention on the Rights of People with Disabilities. That carries certain responsibilities and implications with it but, even in terms of the national reform plans, there are certain things there which our Member States have agreed to do and agreed to share, and therefore the issue – whether it is about benchmarking, impact assessment or whatever – is about taking account of what they are doing and looking at how they are going to deal with the effects of that in terms of the anti-poverty targets, in terms also, as many have stressed, of the issues of human dignity and indeed what we consider to be solidarity within the European Union and acceptable standards, which I think is extremely important. The issue about the growing inequalities is also something that I think we should really be concerned about. We are well aware of what the adverse impacts of health inequalities are for people’s life chances. There is a lot I think that can be done, even if you are not looking at particularly radical reform: at least close the gaps in systems that allow people to fall through them and lose their right to access care – people who were maybe working on temporary contracts or whatever and who therefore do not actually gain the health benefits that they might otherwise have done in full-term contracts. There are things that can be done to reduce the gaps, to reduce the barriers in terms of access to care.  A lot of points have been made, as well, about the role of carers themselves. It is true – we have heard the figures from all of our Member States about what it actually saves public services when people are caring on an informal basis – but that does need to be recognised. People should not be asked to give up their opportunities to work – their own work-life balance, as it were – to provide that ongoing service without some form of recognition. Recognition within the pension system was mentioned, but it is also extremely important in terms of the support and the care of carers.  There is more that can be done as well, we believe, in terms of actually improving the quality, the decent work side, of those who are providing care on a paid basis. Given the future demands that we have seen, we need to address that very rapidly. Yes, there is money there from the Cohesion Fund, not as much as many of us would have liked, but again that was a political choice made by our national governments, and indeed some in Parliament, but we ought to make sure that this money is spent effectively and to the maximum. Thank you again for the debate and we look forward to the follow-up action on this. Jean Lambert  (Verts/ALE
). -  
Mr President, I have a couple of questions, but firstly I would like to make it absolutely clear that it is scandalous that we even have to look at having a food distribution programme in the European Union and that people are living in poverty and, secondly, that if we are going to, I certainly would support such a Fund. However, I would like some clarification. If each country is expected to participate but does not use the allocated money, what happens to that money as foreseen under this proposal? Is it reallocated within the Fund or does it go back to the general budget?  Secondly, in some accounts of the allocation that I have seen, the UK and Germany, for example, could do very well out of this Fund in terms of getting significant amounts of money and other countries, some of whom have been dependent on this Fund, such as Spain and Portugal, would actually have a lower allocation of monies as a result of Germany and the UK, etc. getting so much. Is that correct?  Thirdly, does one presume, given that this financing is coming from the European Social Fund envelope, that if countries are taking money for the Food Aid Fund from that envelope, they will have less to use from the Social Fund for other things?

 Mr President, we did manage to get in something positive about gender identity and the Qualifications Directive. In terms of the common European asylum system, we are not there yet. Certainly with this latest round of recasts we have seen the limits of the recast system. Many of us feel we fought for every bit of progress that we have managed to get in this package, against a number of Member States that certainly did not want to move.  We can see that we do not yet have a common system if you look at what is happening with one and a half million refugees from Syria, a relatively small number of them in the European Union. Yet when you see the examination of their claims, some countries appear to be doing the job properly, others are not and virtually all claims are being rejected. One of the things that this Parliament, and certainly my Group, wanted was the genuine examination of every claim. We wanted to see high standards of human rights, we wanted to see a higher standard of consistency across Member States, not the lottery that Ms Guillaume has referred to, and we wanted to see the respect of the dignity of individuals, not treating people as criminals and automatically locking them up in closed centres simply because they dared to claim asylum.  So what progress do we have against those benchmarks? My colleagues will speak of Eurodac and procedures. It is true that on Dublin we have made quite a bit of progress compared to the current Dublin II Regulation. A number of the concerns raised in the latest report from a Jesuit refugee service will be addressed, and the recent Court case will be really important. We do not want children left at airports because they have not been picked up by people from the social services of the country to which they are being returned again.  On reception, my judgment would be that we have made marginal progress and that a number of safeguards in terms of levels of support, and indeed safeguards in terms related to detention, really do not take us very far forward. I am sorry to say that. Jean Lambert,

 Mr President, while we broadly welcome the social investment package we felt that much of it was very ‘soft’, and almost a reworking of a number of things which we have heard before. Obviously, we are pleased that we are looking at social investment and the importance of an economic stabiliser being recognised as part of our social protection system. But the issue of adequacy, I think, is still one that many of us are really concerned about. We are seeing more people in poverty now than ever, and we also seem to be losing track of any idea of actually trying to create greater equality in our societies by reducing the gap between rich and poor, not simply looking at how we raise those at the bottom.  The quality of public services is important, obviously, and there is a real area for investment there, including in jobs. But I also want to say something about the recommendation on children. Many people are very worried about demographics in the European Union, and here we have a recommendation which is a very strong one in terms of the focus on early intervention.  We are concerned about nutrition globally, in terms of poverty reduction measures and making the best of children’s futures, and we are seeing a growing need for emergency food aid here. We are seeing vaccination programmes here under threat. We know what happens to children’s life chances if they are in poor housing. The high-quality child care model set out in the Barcelona targets seems to be really mouldering. So where do we really see the action coming on this, not just the policy? What can we expect from the Member States in terms of a range of ministers really working with the economic ministers who seem to be totally in charge of things at the moment?

It is equality within states and between Member States. If you look at some of the impact there at the moment from various social systems, you can see that there are Member States within which there is a greater equality – both newer and older Member States.  It is as much to do with the systems and the values that you put in place as anything else. Therefore the issue of making sure that you have a level of social security which means that people are not left in poverty becomes absolutely crucial. It is not only about older and newer. There are lessons to be learned from, say, the Czech Republic just as there are from Sweden or Denmark. Jean Lambert,

Madam President, I am also speaking in my capacity as Chair of the Delegation for relations with South Asia, which covers Bangladesh. In that capacity, I have also issued a statement of condolence to the families of those tragically killed. A few days ago, Bangladesh moved over 1 million people out of danger from an approaching cyclone. There we saw 13 deaths, mainly people hit by trees, and loss of property. Why am I mentioning this? Well, because I think that it shows what can be done to reduce disasters and risks when government and civil society work together with international help. We need the same determined attitude to risk reduction in the textiles sector, and I could add shipbreaking as well. In the textiles sector we have over 4 million people, mainly women, who ought to be able to feel that they can return home safely after the end of a working day having earned a decent living wage. That has implications – as others have mentioned – for the prices actually paid by the buyers. These recent tragedies have no doubt raised the issue’s profile, and they have certainly raised political pressure. We are seeing a concerted response at the moment, and I am really pleased that the ILO is in there and that the European Union is also offering its support. The accord on fire and building safety, which brings together the trade unions, NGOs, government and the textile retailers, is important. I do not think that we should step back from naming companies who have yet to sign up. That public pressure is really important and, as my colleague has said, it is the coordinated holistic response, not a series of parallel inspections, that is really needed. Equally, some of the other measures that we have talked about, in terms of corporate social responsibility, need to be enforced. So my group will not be supporting the amendments to write these issues out of this resolution. The action plan is certainly to be welcomed. That strengthened role for trade unions, I think we would all agree, is extremely important within this, as is their ability to organise freely and to hold management to account. Management responsibility in Rana Plaza was desperately lacking. Bringing in additional inspectors who have to be able to do their job properly without interference is also important. We would also echo that GSP should be an incentive: yes, there are obviously consequences if you don’t move forward on it, but let us start with the incentive first and across all countries. This is something we should also be considering in the India Free Trade Agreement, as India also has a big textile sector that needs attention. Jean Lambert,

Mr President, I am speaking both in my capacity as Chair of the delegation for South Asia and as a Group member. The European Parliament has supported the need for war crimes trials in Bangladesh, given the atrocities committed during the liberation war 40 years ago and the shadows still cast over the country by those events. Commitment to hold such trials was part of the Awami League manifesto in the last general election, the result of which was widely accepted, and that party is now in government. Many of us have mixed feelings in relation to the issue. We recognise the need for the trials, but deplore that the death penalty is still on the statute books. We understand the political dimension of the trials, but believe it is essential for the courts to be fully in control and that political interference from any quarter is unacceptable and must be resisted for the outcome to be trusted. We understand the desire of Bangladesh to deal with its past, but that should not mean that such trials fall below national and international standards, and there is cause for concern at present. Recent changes to the rules on appeal are particularly worrying. We recognise that public passions will run high but, as the war crimes trials themselves bear witness, there has been enough death, violence and intimidation. It is an absolute tragedy to see the numbers of recent dead, targeting of minorities, hacking to death of law enforcement officers and the use of live ammunition against civilians. So we call on all sides and all those in positions of power and influence to call a halt to the violence. Jean Lambert,

Mr President, I too would like to thank the rapporteur for the good cooperation on this report. I can agree with her introductory remarks and, indeed, those of the Commission and most of the others we have heard this evening, though not quite all.  Her report is important because it recognises that integration is an active policy. It also recognises migrants as individuals, with different needs and, therefore, different programmes that need to work for those individuals if they are going to contribute to our societies and we are also going to contribute to their lives; we do not want people leaving the European Union at any stage having lost skills, having their talents under-used, or indeed not having their lives developed.  In that respect, it is also very important, in terms of the workplace being a key point of integration, to make sure that our anti-discrimination measures are working, that equality of treatment applies and indeed that we have in place a social security system that actually recognises those contributions once people have left the European Union.

Mr President, I very much welcome the opportunity to address these questions to the Commission. We are well aware in this Parliament of unemployment across the European Union, but of course young people with disabilities are likely to have the greatest difficulty of all in getting their first job in any sector, even the new ones. So the accessibility proposal mentioned by the Commissioner would be welcome, but we would also like to see a really strong and active implementation of the anti-discrimination directives already on the statute books. Cuts – as we know – are reducing the possibility for independence and social inclusion, even in those countries which have been most progressive. Indeed, as my colleague Marian Harkin has said, there is mounting evidence that people with disabilities face growing hostility in a number of Member States. A recent poll by the UK charity Scope showed that two-thirds of respondents had recently experienced hostility – up by 40% in just four months. This is being stoked by parts of the press, even quality papers like The Telegraph

 Mr President, I also speak in my capacity as Chair of the delegation of the European Parliament which covers Bangladesh, among other countries. Along with others from my group, we would like to express our condolences to the families of those who have died in fires and other accidents in various textile factories and elsewhere. It is an issue, as we have said, which spreads beyond Bangladesh, even though that is our primary focus today. We are well aware that squeezed profit margins do not only lead to pressure on wages but can also lead to shortcuts in safety, and we are concerned that many of the major companies who had contracts with the Tazreen factory did not want to acknowledge that at the time of the tragedy, even though the building had recently passed an evaluation by one of those major contractors. We also welcome the response from the governments in Pakistan and Bangladesh in terms of compensation and commitment to the victims and their families, and we welcome the contribution that has been made by some overseas companies as well; we only wish there were more of them. My colleague has just referred to the outcome of the tripartite meeting yesterday: the ILO, the government, the employers and workers should be seen as positive in terms of commitment to act, to abide by the existing laws, regulations and procedures, and to see that those are properly implemented and that there are consequences if that does not happen. That is a clear responsibility: government. It is also important, in our view, that there are active trade unions and labour rights’ activists such as Aminul Islam, who was recently murdered. It is essential to this process, as our history has shown, to have active trade unions on the ground working with health and safety committees and able to blow the whistle on employers who do not live up to their obligations. But those who have contracts there also have a crucial role in improving standards, and we regret that certain companies – Walmart is one that has been mentioned in the press – have been less than forthcoming and active in that role. As consumers we should be confident that the clothes we wear have not put someone’s life at risk wherever they work, and I welcome what has been done by our delegation in Bangladesh and in other countries to improve labour standards and make sure that everybody is safe at work.

Mr President, we have seen that it is not so easy to stand up against forces like the Taliban when one personally, one’s family and those close to one are actually being threatened, and indeed murdered. We in this Parliament commend Malala’s bravery and that of Hina Khan and countless others – those girls, and boys, who attend education even when they are under threat. There has been political and public outcry in Pakistan over this tragic event, and we should be supporting that outcry. The women’s caucus in the parliament has been instrumental in changing the laws in Pakistan. The problem will now be the implementation, because for some, like the Taliban, education is a threat to the power structure. We have seen almost 1 000 attacks on schools in that area of Pakistan, so we know it is crucially important for the government to invest in universal education and an open curriculum. We should be supporting it in every way we can to stand up against the forces of oppression. Jean Lambert  (Verts/ALE

 I abstained on this vote. There are significant monies to be paid for commitments made over this financial period which are now being requested – and a number of them are late. As the EU cannot carry over monies unspent from previous years, we have been unable to build up any provision for these requests. However, Member States have had those unspent monies returned to their national budgets, where they can carry forward unspent monies: they are now unwilling to restore that money to the EU budget in order to meet commitments made – ironically, largely to Member States. I doubt if they will be willing to forgo those payments and will thus still expect payment. The monies owed are larger than the additional amount requested by Commission and Parliament. I was also angered during the vote by the hypocrisy of some Members who, while arguing for a reduced budget, then voted for additional and continuing funding for the ITER project which is, in my opinion, a waste of Union resources. We also failed to have a qualified majority to end export and tobacco subsidies, when we could find money by ending such damaging projects. Jean Lambert,

. – Mr President, my thanks as well to the rapporteur, not least for trying to push through a wider vision of what the European Year of Citizens should be about, rather than just focusing on the rights to free movement. These rights do need to be better understood. We know that they are crucially important and that for many citizens they are seen as the key indicator of equality within an EU setting, along with coordination of social security rights – maybe this is why certain governments and parties feel that to help make the European Union less acceptable they have to call those rights into question at the moment. As our rapporteur says, the EU needs to be able to answer the bigger questions about what role citizens are playing in decision-making in the European Union. The current crisis certainly makes many feel that they are on the receiving end of decisions made elsewhere, and that decisions are being made to suit unaccountable markets rather than individuals and families living with the consequences. Maybe one of the outcomes we should be looking at for this European Year is to have a real citizens’ charter. Jean Lambert  (Verts/ALE

 I supported the Rapporteur today in his proposal to reject ACTA. The Greens have been an integral part of the campaign to raise awareness of the problems we see within this Treaty, for individual rights and the protection of some of those most in need. Concerns about the draconian and disproportionate penalties linked to copyright infringement in the proposed Treaty are well-known. I am deeply concerned that governments and the Commission have put themselves in the position where ACTA is the subject of an ECJ ruling concerning its compatibility with Fundamental Human Rights. I am also concerned at the potential problems arising for generic medicines – essential for improved healthcare for some of the world’s poorest people. I look forward to future Treaties being given the same rigorous scrutiny as ACTA has received. Jean Lambert  (Verts/ALE

 I regret that the alternative motion for a resolution was not passed as it contained strong guarantees in relation to cloning and transport times for live animals. However, I supported the resolution which was eventually passed as it is a positive step forward. The EU urgently needs to address the effective implementation of existing legislation, not least with regard to the Zoos Directive, and Member States need to increase their rate and standard of inspection in relation animal welfare. It seems that many of my colleagues believe that high welfare standards reduce competitiveness: it is true that those producers who cut costs by cutting standards are a problem: they need to be tackled by making sure rules are kept, where they exist. But we also need to address the rules of international trade, so that methods of production can be made explicit and also used to ban low-welfare imports. Jean Lambert  (Verts/ALE

 I welcome today’s resolution on basic bank accounts, and the Commission’s response during the debate, as being important steps towards greater social inclusion. An estimated 30 million European citizens do not have a bank account and approximately 7 million have been refused access to one. While some may choose not to be within the banking system (and, given current events, who can be surprised at their decision?), many others do not have a choice. They then find it difficult to take out contracts for housing or other essential services, and may find themselves paying higher prices for domestic utilities as companies effectively charge a premium for what they view as ‘high-risk’ groups: the poorest are often hit hardest. I look forward to the Commission’s proposal on legislation later this year. Jean Lambert  (Verts/ALE

Madam President, I think that some of this debate is profoundly depressing when we are talking about how to keep the European Union out of human rights provisions. This is about accession to the European Convention, the European Court, rights for all within the European Union. It closes the gap which is there at the moment and which leaves EU legislation and actions outside the European Court of Human Rights. So the purpose of the Convention, the purpose of the Court, is that it requires governments to meet certain standards – just as many of us want it to require the EU to meet certain standards and to call governments and other authorities to account. Now there may be judgments from the European Court that we do not like. There are some that I am not too happy about. But the whole point is that it is not a pick-and-mix. You do not simply take those judgments that you like and put them into practice, while with others you simply say: I did not like the judges who made that. If you do not like the judges, argue for the reform and training of the judges, and then when you are making those arguments, also remember that a lot of court findings are against countries such as Russia and Ukraine, the very places we have heard complaints about. This is about the rule of law, within a human rights context; about how governments and other authorities respond to being held to account. That is something I want to see brought in for the European Union, not left outside. (The speaker agreed to take a blue-card question under Rule 149(8)) Jean Lambert  (Verts/ALE

 Maybe this would be an argument for actually having the European Union within the European Court of Human Rights framework? Then you could actually bring those cases there, could you not? Jean Lambert,  
on behalf of the Verts/ALE Group. 
– Mr President, I, too, would like to thank the rapporteur for the work that has been done on this. As has been said, it is a highly technical document, but it is an extremely important one for individuals within the European Union. As people have said, this is the latest update of what is – in many ways – one of the earliest pieces of legislation put in place by the European Union. It has been extensively revised – a job that we finished in 2009 – and this is now the update. Very soon, we will be seeing how the new electronic system that underpins this is coming into effect, and hopefully it will be able to deal with citizens’ concerns more rapidly. This concerns the maintenance of rights for people who move across borders for whatever reason or who work in border areas. It deals with the areas of core social security, health care, unemployment, pensions, family benefits, etc. It is extremely important that those rights are upheld. I think we have got quite a citizen-friendly outcome from this first reading agreement. As we have been saying, it is designed to uphold the rights of individuals who are covered by social security systems. It was not put in place to provide an opportunity for businesses – particularly those with mobile workers – to cut costs by providing them with an opportunity to choose the cheapest place to register their workers for social security purposes. I am very pleased that we have actually managed to close that particular loophole within this revision, because to find yourself registered in a country where you feel you have no connection and to seek health care treatment, for example, in the country where you are resident, is bound to lead to confusion and a lot of difficulties for the individual. Even though the company concerned may feel that it is doing a good deal for itself and its shareholders, it is not playing fair by its workers. So we are very pleased to have got the ‘home base’ definition in there, bringing it into line with other legislation to make it very clear to individuals exactly where it is that they are registered and therefore what rights they can expect. I think we have achieved a very good outcome, and we are very pleased to see it going through at first reading. Jean Lambert  (Verts/ALE

 Mr President, I very much welcome the opportunity, at long last, to have a debate on Nigeria. It is a major country, as we have heard, which is extremely important in the region and potentially internationally. I very much regret that the only way we seem to be able to discuss events in Nigeria is via yet another resolution which has taken religion as its focus. I want to respond to some of what has been said today. Let us be clear here that, while Boko Haram is the major force behind the violence, they are not killing only Christians. Muslims have died too. They have also assassinated Muslims who do not agree with them. However, there have also been Muslim deaths where Christians – or so-called Christians – have retaliated. We have also seen these events being condemned by political and faith leaders from a variety of different perspectives. It is very important to remember what has been said about what links this country, and not just what divides it. Yes, corruption is an issue. There is more that we could be doing. I, for one, very much welcome the recent trial in British courts of Ibori, a former governor of Delta State, which put him in jail. There is more that our own countries can do to deal with corruption. The people of Nigeria want a government that is fit for purpose. That is why, as we have heard, they were willing to stand for hours in the sun waiting to vote. However, I believe that the European Union, too, needs to change its relationship with Nigeria and that this Parliament should be strengthening its relationships with the Nigerian Parliament. Jean Lambert  (Verts/ALE
).  
– Mr President, we know that this is a difficult debate. It was difficult the first time round. Indeed, at that time, some of us who were in the House felt that the directive that we are currently discussing was too flexible and we launched a case before the ECJ concerning a couple of the provisions of the directive. Unfortunately, from the point of view of some of us, the ECJ found in the wrong way, but nevertheless it upheld two of the issues, not least about children joining their families. So while there are those who argue that this directive is unnecessarily lax, I think that we can see within the directive how we look differently at issues of flexibility. At present, four Member States covered by the directive are using it in a more and more restrictive manner, despite the rulings of the European Court of Justice. I think that is an issue that the Commission needs to look at. As someone said, the whole goal of this directive was in favour of family reunification as a measure of integration. Integration measures were meant to be part of the goal, not a barrier to family reunification. We know about people being asked to take language courses abroad when those courses do not exist and we know about highly restrictive costs in terms of coming to join family members. All of these measures are put in place to actually erect barriers. I believe, and my group believes, that those certainly need to be challenged. We are also hearing a great deal about issues of marriage and whether marriages are genuine or not. This is, of course, incredibly difficult to determine, not least when you look at the divorce rates of some EU nationals. But, nevertheless, there are ways in which we can deal with this. Some Member States already have legislation in place on issues relating to forced marriage, rather than arranged marriage. The EU has programmes in third countries looking at the empowerment of young women and girls and indeed trying to change family attitudes on the issue. There are also measures that you can take at interview stage to try to establish whether it is a forced marriage or not. I am really interested that people are so concerned about this because a number of us in this House want to bring forward measures looking at the question of forced marriage. We look forward to support from some unusual sources in terms of women’s rights on this. There is flexibility in the directive. We know that. As I say, we have seen ECJ rulings that have tried to put a limit on certain parts of the flexibility, but I think that, rather than looking to open up the directive, we need to ask the Commission what it has been doing in terms of infringement proceedings. In 2008, they said this directive was inadequately transposed and inadequately implemented in a number of Member States. What has happened since to improve that situation? Jean Lambert  (Verts/ALE

 I have voted for this resolution, not because I am enamoured of the content of the so-called six-pack (I voted against much of it) or because the euro is the way forward for all – it is not. I am supporting it because I want decision making on matters of direct interest to the EU to be taken within a clear legal framework and on a clear legal basis. I regret the British Government’s refusal to support concerted EU action and thus assist a push towards this new arrangement. An intergovernmental agreement can inhabit a grey zone, out of clear parliamentary oversight. We need clear parliamentary oversight: from both the EP and national parliaments, and this resolution states that clearly. The proposed intergovernmental agreement also sees governments stepping back from decisions made a few weeks ago, and this does not increase confidence or legal certainty. As the resolution clearly states, we need investment, not just austerity. We need a change of direction – towards a different future, based on reducing the gap between rich and poor and on new investment to help us work within environmental limits. The intergovernmental agreement is a distraction and provides no real solutions. Jean Lambert,

 Mr President, I think it is clear that for all of us the legislation that we are talking about this evening maybe is not the most perfect that we would have hoped for. However I think many of us see it as a positive step forward, and certainly analysis of it that has been done says that it may be positive in terms of integration for the many thousands of people affected by the legislation. It is a simplification in terms of putting together the residence and work permit as a single piece of paperwork. That, we know, was controversial, as well in the way in which it was discussed. But it should be a simplification and, as has been pointed out, there is a due requirement of time so that these applications should not be left sitting on desks as they so often are in many of our Member States. In terms of the rights section of it – which the Committee on Employment and Social Affairs was largely dealing with – I think we have made some progress there. The most important part of it is that we are looking at equality of treatment with Member State nationals in a large number of places, not least in terms of pay, rights of freedom of association and the right to educational/vocational training so that people are actually able to improve their skills base, which is for their own benefit and for the benefit of the company with which they work. The social security dimension is also important and I think that the changes that Parliament managed to make on pensions is one which we should be proud of. Jean Lambert  (Verts/ALE

 Mr Batten, my understanding is that the UK is not actually signing up to this, so I do not quite understand what you said. Why do you assume that people are going to be flooding to a country which is not actually covered by this directive? Jean Lambert  (Verts/ALE
).  
– Madam President, I, too, would like to thank the rapporteur for this extremely comprehensive report, which I think should be compulsory reading for every Finance Minister. As my colleague, Ms Harkin, has just been saying, what we are seeing at the moment is a disconnect between macro-economic policy and the effect that it actually has on people’s lives on the ground. I want to respond to one or two points made by other colleagues this morning – it is a pity they are not still here. The bailouts are not charity. They are about solidarity, and they come with interest rates attached. The ESF itself is about solidarity, and that is why many of us in this House would like to see an increase in the monies going to other countries to help them combat poverty. In terms of the root causes of poverty, I for one do not believe that it is about a lack of opportunity. In some Member States where, for example, every job vacancy is being pursued by at least five unemployed people – before you even begin to look at skills mismatches and geographical mismatches – I think it is a little bit difficult to say that we are going to cut the benefits of people who have not found a job when those jobs are not there. Investment in social protection, as this report makes very clear, makes sound economic sense. It is an economic stabiliser; it helps recovery; it reduces future costs where we have to pick up the pieces of people whose health has deteriorated and whose educational opportunities have been lost; and it keeps the local economy moving. But I also want to see a reduction in the gap between rich and poor. That is what the ‘Occupy’ movement is about – the power of the 1% as against the other 99% – and that is why issues about a living wage and adequate income are essential in this debate. Jean Lambert,  
on behalf of the Verts/ALE Group.

 Mr President, my group would also like to thank the rapporteur and the shadows for the good cooperation in difficult negotiations. Whilst we certainly welcome the offence of online grooming being created, I must admit we found the attitude of Council in not wanting to incorporate grooming in all senses into this on the grounds that it already exists in national legislation a little surprising, given that many of the other offences here also exist in national legislation. My group, too, welcomes the inclusion for the first time in EU legislation of sex tourism related to children and the jurisdiction over nationals travelling for the purposes of child abuse, but we also agree with the Commission that it is a pity that we have not been able to find a solution on those enjoying habitual residence. We also welcome the recognition of the need to deal with the associated advertising and facilitation of such travel. We, too, welcome the measures to deal with the exclusion of convicted offenders from employment involving direct and regular contact with children. We welcome the move to make it possible for employers to request information about the potential employees for professional or organised voluntary activities with children, according to national law. Article 25 relating to websites was particularly difficult to negotiate, as has already been said, and obviously the priority must
 be to protect children. However, there are legitimate concerns that measures employed for this crucial purpose become co-opted for other purposes of state control. The solution reached in this directive is important and has the full support of my group. We also welcome support for survivors knowing the tragic consequences that such abuse has for so many children throughout their lives. Finally, we welcome the recognition, too, of the difference for consensual sexual activity between young people, whom we do not want to criminalise for behaviour that may be foolish but which is certainly not exploitative. Jean Lambert,  
rapporteur.

 Madam President, I would like to start by thanking all the shadows on this report, the staff members from the three institutions – not least my own office – the Presidencies concerned and the Commission for their interest, effort and commitment over the time we have been negotiating the revision of this directive. I would also like to thank the experts who have supported us. This year marks the 60th anniversary of the Geneva Convention on Refugees. At EU level, it is this directive which sets out the standards for qualification for international protection: for those classic refugees who have a well-founded fear of persecution – such as many of those who dared to oppose Colonel Gadaffi and thus qualified for refugee status; and for those at risk of serious harm – perhaps a teenage girl facing the death penalty in Iran for having sexual intercourse outside marriage, who could then perhaps qualify for subsidiary protection. As well as setting out such criteria, the directive deals with the content of such protection, such as access to healthcare or education. The revision of the directive is limited; it is a recast. The Committee on Civil Liberties, Justice and Home Affairs would like to have dealt with such issues as ‘actors of protection’, where the majority of us believe this should only be the state. That is why we have cited Article 7 as one we think should be looked at in the next review, as should the definition of ‘family members’. I also wish to put on record my own concern at the lack of change in Article 10(1)(d), where the cumulative definition of a social group was maintained by the Commission rather than being offered as an alternative. I trust, at least, that the ten Member States operating in the optional perspective will continue to do so. However, some progress has been made. The definition of a social group which could suffer persecution must now include due consideration of gender-related aspects. We have also included a reference to legal tradition and customs in Recital 30. We also include sexual orientation and, for the first time, gender identity. We should not expect people to deny their identity throughout their lifetime in the hope that this will make them safe from persecution. As concerns children – the topic of the last debate – Recital 18 lays down some principles, though not an exhaustive list, to help in determining the best interests of the child. This principle is also linked to entitlement to benefits. In Article 31 we have sought to improve the tracing of family for unaccompanied minors, across the asylum process. With regard to the content of protection, we have tried to ensure the same treatment for all beneficiaries of international protection and have achieved this in many areas, notably in terms of recognition of qualifications and access to employment. People want to contribute to the country that is providing protection. However, a few Member States have insisted on being able to maintain certain differences between the two groups. This seems to be based on the misapprehension that those at risk of serious harm will need protection for a shorter period of time than those at risk of serious persecution. Our fight – maybe I should say our debate – over the length of residence permits yielded a small victory. However, we would invite the Member States most concerned in relation to difference of treatment to reflect as to whether an annual consideration of status is a good use of public money, and whether it reduces administrative burdens or provides a better context for integration than a period of at least three years. After all, there is a possibility of using cessation provisions if a need for protection changes. To conclude, this revised directive takes small, but important, steps towards a common European asylum policy, but the system is only as common as the consistent high quality of its implementation across all participating Member States. We hope that movement on this directive will help provide impetus for the remaining measures and show that progress is possible. Jean Lambert,  
rapporteur.

 Mr President, I would like to thank all who have participated in the debate today. It is true that we have difficulties with our asylum system; we know that the results can be very different from country to country, and we are also aware that this one step forward is not going to solve all the problems – although we know that it will give greater clarity in certain areas and hopefully provide a stronger base for Member States to build on the good practice which exists in some and to share that with the others. We have heard a number of regrets. Well, we all have a few but, then again, maybe not too few to mention on this occasion. Certainly in terms of the correlation tables: yes, we would like to have seen those. We would have liked to see Member States being very clear about their implementation but, on the other hand, what I think we are more interested at this point is actually moving forward in terms of the content and the common asylum system. I think it says a lot that the rapporteurs from the other asylum dossiers have all been present tonight at this debate, and many have spoken. The willingness of Parliament to move forward is extremely clear, because this is a team effort. I thank people for their warm words, but this is a team effort and involves compromise and solidarity amongst us in Parliament to try and move things in Council. As we have heard, we hope that the movement on this directive – and I hope that groups will be voting in favour of it tomorrow (and maybe one or two groups might like to reconsider their abstentions) – will help provide impetus for the remaining measures and show that progress is possible, and that quality and consistency build confidence among the Member States and the public and deliver sound humanitarian protection for those in need. I think that is what we need to have at the front of our minds when we are looking at this asylum package. Jean Lambert,  
rapporteur for the opinion of the Committee on Employment and Social Affairs
. −
 Madam President, let us hope that, when we come to review this directive, we can do it on a different legal basis. Our committee took the view that the legal basis should be Article 153 of the Treaty, as this matter directly concerns health and safety. We also underlined the importance of providing information and genuine consultation with workers concerning the safety case and safety assessments, not only of sites dealing with spent fuel and radioactive waste, but also as regards how these should be transported, and the need for a rigorous and effective inspection regime with sanctions that are effective, dissuasive and proportionate. We also want to see that all licence holders ensure thorough and ongoing training of all involved in dealing with these substances, including subcontractors – potentially a weak link in the safety chain – casual workers and all others working on site, whatever their job. We also took the view that there was no easy divide between civil and military waste, given that civilians may well handle military waste these days. Jean Lambert,  
on behalf of the Verts/ALE Group. 
– Madam President, I, too, would like to congratulate Ms Berès for taking the initiative on this oral question and resolution. I would also like to thank the Commissioner for his answer. It is all too rare that we get a very specific response from Commissioners to questions in an oral question. My group very much welcomes the proposal from the ILO for the Convention and the recommendation on domestic workers. We are aware that at least 20 of our own Member States have already commented on the draft and been actively involved in this. We look forward to early ratification by those Member States and, indeed, some interesting implementation. People have talked very much about how this group of workers is particularly vulnerable. A lot of the work is done behind closed doors; it is invisible. Often, the workers themselves are isolated, and access to trade unions is often very difficult in this situation. Quite often, if you are taken on as a live-in employee, you can be seen as being on call 24/7. We know in this House that on-call working is a very controversial issue and something that we do not particularly welcome. As has been said, domestic work is often undervalued, or seen as traditional women’s work that ‘anybody can do’, but we have also made the point that a lot of it is actually quite skilled. It can quite often involve nursing care and various aspects of child development. Domestic workers often occupy a real position of trust. While many employers value that, there are only too many who do not. For example, in the UK we have seen a recent case of somebody actually ending up with a prison sentence on a charge of trafficking for domestic servitude. The young woman involved lost four years of her life to her employer, who received a nine-month sentence. So we need to look at how we identify that form of trafficking. Migrant female workers are very vulnerable indeed. We have come across cases, for example, of workers entering the country with diplomats and having their passport taken away; people in that situation have virtually no freedom, have no access to assistance and do not know about their rights. I want to raise one issue concerning Article 17 in the proposed Convention, which is about the role of agencies. I think this is something that we really should be looking at at European level because, increasingly, it is being seen as a weak link in many of the issues that we are facing. Jean Lambert  (Verts/ALE
).  
– Mr President, I speak as Chair of the delegation which covers Pakistan, and I must say that some real crocodile tears have been shed here tonight by people expressing views which are about 180 degrees away from those they normally express. When we have discussed this issue here in the past, we have been assured by the Commission that the items in question have been carefully assessed to ensure they do not clash with EU exports. Has this changed? We have been asked: why textiles from Pakistan? The answer is: because textiles are a major export for them. You cannot expect them to conjure up something within a few months. We, too, had our doubts about the potential effect of this measure in the flood-stricken areas. We raised this matter when we were in Pakistan, and we heard directly from Members of Parliament there that the measure would be of benefit to industry in their constituencies, so I really think that we should consider the message we send if we do not support this measure. Jean Lambert,  
on behalf of the Verts/ALE Group. 
– Madam President, I am very pleased that the Commissioner reminded us that the overwhelming amount of movement in the region has been in North Africa itself. The UNHCR estimates that over 400 000 people have already left Libya. That is something that, having listened to the debate on the Procedures Directive earlier, some of our Members would do well to remember: the majority of people are moving within North Africa. We very much welcome the support given to the UNHCR and other bodies in assisting those displaced. A lot of concern, however, has been voiced at the pressure on Malta and Lampedusa, and quite rightly. It is significant, but not equivalent to what is happening in Tunisia and Egypt. However, there is growing concern about what is happening to minors – unaccompanied or separated at arrival. There is concern that they are not being properly supported or identified. We hope that the Commission will look at their situation and at the situation of those others considered particularly vulnerable at this point. We also welcome the willingness to consider using the Temporary Protection Directive. Could the Commissioner please outline what criteria she will be using in making that assessment as to whether to bring forward a recommendation? Jean Lambert,

– Mr President, I think all of us have been very deeply shocked and appalled by the assassination of Minister Shahbaz Bhatti, not least because he is someone known to us in this Parliament: he has visited here, he has met many of us; but also because this is another highly symbolic killing, striking at someone who was looking for reconciliation and work across all minorities in Pakistan. We should also add our condolences not only to his family, but also to all the families of those who have been killed in terrorist attacks in Pakistan. This week, we have seen two such attacks, which have killed and injured more people than, for example, the London bombings. The whole population is suffering, and intimidation is undermining democracy in Pakistan. We are seeing a change in the demographics of certain constituencies, for example, Quetta, as intimidation works to force people out. Our resolution is important in terms of wanting to continue and support the work, in terms of tolerance and mutual understanding. I would like to make the point that we need that in the European Union, too, where certain recent ministerial statements, in my view, have not helped that. So we expect leadership in Pakistan and in the European Union. Jean Lambert,  
on behalf of the Verts/ALE Group. 
– Madam President, I, too, would like to add my voice to that of others who thanked our rapporteur for the very good work that has been done on this report. We are all aware there are national differences, as well as differences within our own political groups, and to come up with anything that gains a significant level of support is quite something. My group is especially pleased that the report before us recognises the importance of first-pillar pensions, the commitment to an adequate level, the issue of being able to provide a decent life. After all, we spent all of last year, 2010, dealing with questions of poverty. And, of course, this is also, for many people, a fixed income, an essential guarantee. Like others, we also welcome the recognition that we need to tackle decent pension provision here for women. We also recognise the importance of tackling discrimination against older workers and using other measures to help people stay in work. For us, too, the portability of pension rights is a crucial issue. More and more people are not working for one company throughout their working life. Indeed, they are working for several, and not always in the same country. And we need to avoid this fragmentation of pension provision, so there is an essential role for the European Union there. We are also pleased to see that this report contains a commitment for second-pillar provision, that it should be available without discrimination on grounds of age, gender and work contract. We would agree as well – and are pleased to see it there – that we need to be adopting more of a life course approach that deals with the different rhythms and patterns of modern working lives, both positive and negative. And again we recognise the importance of solidarity in that first pillar, not least for those whose working lives are involved with more casual labour, short-term contracts and so on. We are concerned at any effort to push third-pillar private pension provision and we agree that it is crucial that people have adequate and clear information. We would also welcome the fact that this report contains – if there is going to be a change in pension provision – adequate time for adaptation for people to reconsider their financial futures. Jean Lambert,

 – Mr President, I think all of us would want to express our condolences to the family and friends of Salmaan Taseer, the Governor of Punjab put in place by the government of Pakistan, and we are remembering here today his clear support for Asia Bibi – a position he knew to be controversial and indeed dangerous. We are rightly distressed by his murder and the reaction to it by part of the population of Pakistan, but we should not forget, as well, that many have mourned him and have done that in public as a public act. It is an act we should be commending, like, for example, the action taken by the media regulator against certain media with regard to their coverage of the alleged murderer. However, as we know, the blasphemy law in Pakistan puts the lives of Pakistani citizens at risk: Muslim, Christian and others alike, as many speakers have said this afternoon. We are aware that Pakistan is a new democracy, that it is facing conflict on its borders, and that it has faced the disaster of the recent flood, as well as the earthquake only this week. We know that the government is struggling, but we also recognise that it needs our support in terms of developing democracy within Pakistan, not least in the political battle against extremism and for universal human rights, and it is our role as democratic parliamentarians to support all those who are working for positive change and to give them the voice that others would deny them. We are also asking for action by the government of Pakistan, not least to remove the reservations on the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights – which they ratified with a large number of reservations – and we urged this in our recent delegation visit to Pakistan. We want them, as well, to continue the efforts to change the blasphemy law because this is a law that is more abused than properly used. Jean Lambert,  
on behalf of the Verts/ALE Group. 
– Mr President, many in this House will remember that at first reading, this was an extremely hot topic, and I think we are hearing only some of the differences between us. There were concerns about whether market forces would win out over services of general interest; and that people who were concerned about patients’ rights to choose, and to travel, were being pitted against those who were asking which patients would actually exercise that choice. I think what we have, at the end of the day, is a reasonable compromise. As people have pointed out, in cases where things are medically necessary, with a need for urgent treatment, we already have a system in place under social security coordination. This directive is more concerned with the market system, with choice, and with people’s ability to choose where to go, and to have money follow them. So we have clarity now, in that Member States can put in place systems to enable them to ensure that needs can be met. This directive should also be welcomed because it deals with issues around the legal dimension and legal certainty: with where responsibility for follow-up treatment lies; with the question of redress if there are problems; and with issues around ensuring that procedures are carried out by qualified medical professionals. On the issue of rare diseases, we have also achieved a compromise that is better than what we were pursuing first time round. As people have said, for many patients, this will work well, but we also need to take care of our patients in our own Member States. Jean Lambert,  
on behalf of the Verts/ALE Group. 
– Madam President, we, too, have a concern about the variable labour market that we already have across 27 Member States and within those 27 Member States, but our concern is how we move away from this towards something which is more comprehensive and stronger. We want to be sure that we have an agreed basis of rights for the majority of third-country nationals, as originally set out by the Commission and generally improved in the Committee on Employment and Social Affairs. We do not want to see these rights increasingly restrained and constrained, so we will support the widest possible and strongest range of rights in tomorrow’s vote. We want to remind the Council that we are concerned here with individuals who should be able to develop their skills and education, benefit from the social security contributions they make and look forward to claiming their pension entitlements, given, as is recognised in the proposal, that their work supports our economies and indeed our societies. For our group, the commitment to circular migration is also important in Article 11(a). The scope is a vexed issue because we have other existing instruments under discussion which, at times, come into tension. We are also fooling ourselves if we think that what is on the table here is actually going to meet the needs of each and every migrant worker within the European Union. We need a more nuanced approach to ensure that migration works for them, so we are not going to be voting, for example, to include beneficiaries of humanitarian protection. Jean Lambert  (Verts/ALE
).  
– Madam President, I just want to respond to some of the comments which have been made. What Pakistan is trying to do at this point is actually to help itself out of the mess that it is in after the devastating floods. If the factories were in flood-hit areas, they would not be able to produce, so it is not surprising that the factories concerned are not in flood-hit areas. The direct aid that could be put in is miniscule compared to what the need actually is. Distribution of the income from the additional exports is important – we know that for infrastructure, for energy supplies, for schools, for roads, etc. – while there are indeed responsibilities that lie with the democratically elected government of Pakistan in terms of its effectiveness, of income, of tax revenue and so on. People have also talked about the need for greater diversity. If Pakistan had a greater diversity of industrial sectors, we would not be concentrating so much on textiles. I appeal to Members to offer that country this opportunity to help itself out of this disaster. Jean Lambert  (Verts/ALE
).  
– Madam President, I think we are all aware of the importance of minimum income schemes across the European Union, although not all Member States have them in place yet. We also know that there are very big variations in effectiveness, that there is often no clear basis for the amounts that are paid, and that the amounts paid do not necessarily keep pace with rising costs. Some Member States have a very poor take-up, so people are not getting their entitlements, and some also time-limit these income schemes, which seems very bizarre for something that is meant to be a safety net. I believe very strongly that we need a common framework across the European Union that gives clear principles for how we develop these schemes and a clear methodology for working on them. We are not talking about the same level of payment in each Member State and to keep saying this is to perpetuate something which is deeply untrue. We do need to develop these schemes so that everybody in the EU can live in dignity. Jean Lambert,  
on behalf of the Verts/ALE Group. 
– Madam President, as has been said, what is happening in Pakistan at the moment is a real tragedy and will require long-term commitment on behalf of the people of Pakistan and its democratically-elected government for some time to come. I very much welcome the Commissioner’s response, and indeed her longer-term perspective, not least the link to climate resilience. I share the concerns she has voiced about long-term funding for such disasters. I think we would all urge the international community to intensify its response. We would certainly like to welcome India’s increased contribution to the UN fund, because that sends an important political signal. In our view, the international community could go further. It could release more of Pakistan’s own money by taking action to relieve Pakistan’s international debt, much of which was incurred under military regimes. In 2008, Pakistan spent USD 3 billion on debt repayment: this dwarfs the international aid effort. France and Germany are important bilateral donors. I think we should look with some concern at the repayment terms that may be on offer for the loans that are currently being put forward. I would also like to mention that I think it is important to have a similar response from within Pakistan, not least from rich landowners who could, for example, offer some sort of rent relief for poor tenant farmers who are not going to be able to pay their rent for some time to come. Jean Lambert,  
on behalf of the Verts/ALE Group. 
– Madam President, I would very much like to thank Mrs Lynne for the opportunity for us to be debating this tonight, and I welcome a lot of what the Commissioner has said. Indeed, I found quite a lot of it quite encouraging in some ways. You will have recognised, of course, that a number of our questions concern the issues about the vulnerability of older people and a very strong feeling that we have that it is crucially important that people can feel safe with those providing care. While I take your point about the issues about what is a Member State competence, nevertheless, the open method of coordination exists to help Member States work together on something which, while it is not a competence of the European Union, nevertheless is seen as something of common importance. I think certain of the issues, even about basic care, nutrition, etc., are very important within this. I am also wondering what further steps the Commission might take to persuade Member States of the cost-effectiveness of supporting informal carers. There are certainly figures from the UK that recognise that this is a contribution of billions saved in our economy, because the care is being given by close friends or relatives rather than by the state, and that in fact, investing in something like a carer’s allowance and support mechanisms for carers really is worth doing, rather than having people totally worn out, isolated and suffering their own health and mental health problems because they have been caring for hours without background support. I am also interested in what you are saying about the possibilities of improving the qualifications of carers. Part of that issue, of course, is not only that this concerns women, it often concerns migrant women, and therefore a particular sort of investment is needed. But our resolution also talks about the need for contracts to stipulate at least a minimum income, a minimum wage. I would welcome your comments on that. Jean Lambert,  
rapporteur. 
– Mr President, I am not sure that inspiration is going to be what is on offer but this is obviously a very controversial topic that many Members in this House were terrified to come and speak about, so those of us who are brave enough to be here must seize the moment. I want to start firstly by thanking very much all the shadows who worked on this report for their very active involvement and our ability to find a common negotiating position and act as something of a team. I also want to thank the two Presidencies involved – the Czech and particularly the Swedish Presidency – for their more open attitude on this than we have seen in some negotiations, as we were able to negotiate rather than feel we were there to do what Council wanted – well, sometimes anyway. So, what did we achieve? The aim of the common European asylum support system is to deliver consistent high-quality decision making for those in need of protection, and it really can be a matter of life or death for those in need. It is well known that the system is not delivered in a consistent way across Member States. Differences at times are so great between the best and the worst that there is a lack of confidence which can lead to those who try to deliver objective decisions feeling undermined by those who do not. And those who suffer at the end of the day are those in need of protection. There is also a very strong feeling from some Member States under particular pressure that there is a lack of solidarity from others, that their need for support is not given a real practical response. Under the refugee fund, there has been a funding strand for cooperation between Member States which has led to some positive developments, but it has also become clear that there are limits to this more piecemeal approach. The Asylum Support Office is therefore being set up to provide ongoing support to enhance a consistent approach and to provide active support for countries under particular pressure. Specific tasks are already being assigned to it via other legislation. The key points for the European Parliament during the negotiations have been the role of the European Parliament itself in relation to the Asylum Support Office, how to achieve greater solidarity between the Member States, and the role of civil society and UNHCR with the Office. The issues about the role of Parliament have centred around our relationship with the Director in terms of his or her appointment and ongoing links. We have eventually settled on the European Parliament hearing the recommended candidate, offering a confidential opinion and receiving feedback on how that is being taken into account. The Director will also present the annual report to the relevant committee – I cannot quite believe we had to fight for that, but still – and we can also invite the Director to report on the performance of certain tasks. The role of Parliament in relation to agencies is now a topic for discussion in the interinstitutional working group, and I am now a member of the European Parliament team on that – partly due to my experiences and a certain sense of frustration with the negotiations on the Asylum Support Office. As regards solidarity between the Member States, Parliament wanted binding mechanisms, Council wanted to entrench the voluntary nature of cooperation, and the final language is more neutral, but we do have an external evaluation of the Asylum Support Office to look forward to, which will cover the Support Office’s impact on practical cooperation on asylum. On the role of the consultative forum, there is a lot of real expertise available to Member States, and it seemed obvious to us that such expertise could be valuable. We know that some Member States have active relationships with NGOs, and we wanted as well to make sure that local authorities, which often deliver much of what is required under the common system, also had an opportunity to be included. So we are pleased to have been able to breathe a little more life into this body. In conclusion, we feel that the Asylum Support Office could play a very valuable role in developing a common system. We hope it will be of high quality – even if we could not quite get that into the final text – and help engender a sense of mutual confidence and support. I would also ask the Member States involved to be more open to what other institutions, elected authorities and civil society can contribute, because, while this is about cooperation between Member States, it is not entirely intergovernmental. It is a European institution we are creating. Jean Lambert,  
rapporteur. 
– Mr President, I would like to just take an opportunity to clear up one or two questions which have arisen, although it is a pity that some of those asking the questions are not around for the answers. Asylum obligations are clearly set out under international conventions which all Member States have individually signed up to. That is not the same as an immigration policy, and people really should recognise the difference. For those who are concerned about the money – if I may make a party political and national political point here – if certain of our Member States stopped creating asylum seekers from Iraq and Afghanistan, I am sure we could save a lot more money and indeed save people a lot more misery. As regards some of the other points which were raised, it is hoped that improving the quality of the system in certain Member States will be able to increase confidence between Member States and deblock some of the other parts of the asylum system, as well as helping Member States feel that there is support when they are facing particular burdens. As others have pointed out, while some of our Member States do have considerable geographical pressures on them from the flows which arrive, many of the over-burdened countries are actually not in the European Union at all but are elsewhere. I was very interested to hear a colleague arguing for additional support out there, in terms of the Asylum Support Office, but I am afraid I missed the amendments which he tabled on that topic. I also want to be clear that the Asylum Support Office is not there to determine status; it is not taking over the role of Member States in that field. All in all, I welcome the kind comments made by colleagues, I welcome the active involvement of those who have helped me very much on this report, and I am sure that we are all looking forward – or most of us anyway – to being there in Valletta when the ribbon is cut on the Asylum Support Office and we can begin work. Jean Lambert,  
on behalf of the Verts/ALE Group. 
– Mr President, I would like to move an oral amendment which would become paragraph 7a (new). It is signalled on the voting list and my understanding is that it has the support of the political groups co-signing this resolution. It becomes the consequence of paragraph 7. So the new paragraph 7a would read: ‘Hence, calls once again on the Commission to develop a comprehensive European Strategy for Roma Inclusion as the instrument for combating social exclusion and discrimination of Roma in Europe’. Jean Lambert,  
on behalf of the Verts/ALE Group. 
– Mr President, I would like to echo the calls that have been made for a comprehensive strategy here. As has been pointed out, we are now in the European Year for Combating Poverty and Social Exclusion, which we know is difficult in times of recession, and that is why we have been asking for social conditionality on rescue packages so that those who are the most excluded do not find themselves falling even further behind. We have heard already that the gap is widening, which is why our EU 2020 strategy also needs to take into account the need to reduce the gaps between rich and poor. The changes in the regional development funds are important. Local authorities, we would agree with the Council, are important because that is so often where discrimination is most closely felt, on housing and the specific needs of the Roma people there, on education, and on the police whose job it is to protect and not simply to criminalise, as seems to be the way in some Member States. And we want to see high-quality public services. Council will remember its recommendation on the active inclusion of those furthest from the labour market where high-quality public services are seen as crucial. We are interested to know whether the Council and Commission are happy with the absorption rate being shown for funds at the moment. I would also welcome the context change that was strongly put out by the Commission in terms of anti-racism and xenophobia, and would hope that every Member State government would commit itself to those ideals. Jean Lambert  (Verts/ALE
).  
– Mr President, Mr Barroso talked earlier on about wanting an ambitious strategy, and it is true that there are parts of the document EU 2020 which are ambitious, but certainly the greenhouse gas emission figure is not ambitious: it is pathetic, and it is not going to get us where we want to go. We should be looking at 40% by 2020. Of course, the issue is not only about climate but also about resource availability and increasing resource efficiency. There is a lot, as well, that we seem to have seen before in this strategy, not least about economic growth coming through more and more as a goal rather than an indicator. It should not be the goal of a strategy. The EU has many areas where we have tried to decouple growth from transport, energy use, whatever, and it has long been decoupled from jobs. So, can we please not talk as if, somehow, growth is going to deliver jobs? We also need to be looking not just at reducing poverty but reducing inequalities, because that has known demonstrable benefits, and we need to make sure that our financial institutions do not undermine the ambitious goals that we might put in place. Jean Lambert,  
on behalf of the Verts/ALE Group. 
– Mr President, I too would like to thank Stephen Hughes and Liz Lynne for their work on this and indeed to welcome this action, although we would like to have seen it earlier. As has been pointed out, the USA has had legislation in place since 2001. We can now see such legislation in certain parts of the European Union, and at last we are catching up, but, of course, not before many people will already have been affected by this problem. In terms of the risk, the World Health Organisation estimates that, while 90% of exposures to this risk are in the developing world, 90% of reports about occupational infection occur in the United States and the European Union. We know that there is a major issue of under-reporting sharps injuries: estimates range between 40% and 75% and that is huge. Therefore I think we should welcome the fact that, in the social partners’ agreement, clause 11 talks about the duty to report under a no-blame culture. But I think we also need to ask why people are not reporting. Presumably part of it is that they do not understand the risks or that they fear the consequences – not least, perhaps, to their future employment – of reporting such an injury. Indeed in some places we have reports of ineffectual follow-up, in other words, even where people do report, nothing very much happens. Certainly they are not getting even the medical support that they need, let alone the emotional support – or indeed, in some cases, alternative employment, if it is considered that, when they have contracted something like HIV, there may be a risk to patients. We have research which shows that health workers working outside hospitals are more likely to be dissatisfied with the response of employers. People have spoken about the scope of this action. Of course it covers the healthcare sector, and we are very pleased that the agreement covers trainees and subcontractors. I am not entirely sure whether that includes cleaning staff, and I would welcome some clarification on that. But it does not yet cover workers in other professions at risk, so we hope Member States could look at that. The training obligations are extremely important, and I hope Member States will take this seriously: both the giving and receiving of training should be mandatory, as should induction for all new and temporary staff – because I think there is a feeling that if you train people once you never have to look at that issue again. At the moment there is a lack of training even where employers have training policies in place. An issue was raised about the cost. There are estimates that training and preventative measures, including safer devices, account for about a third of the cost of dealing with sharps injuries. That is an important saving in cash-strapped times, as well as being an important issue both for the people concerned and employers, who may indeed find themselves at risk of legal action if they are not taking action to prevent such injuries. Jean Lambert,  
on behalf of the Verts/ALE Group. 
– Madam President, I think there are certain things to be welcomed in the action plan but, as colleagues have correctly pointed out, there are a number of questions there that have not been answered. I think that, when we are looking at this, we are always looking at it from the point of view of the problem that we have and sometimes tend to underestimate the daily reality for people in both Afghanistan and Pakistan of the many deaths, the targeted killings of the Hazara population, for example, in parts of Pakistan, the attacks on girls’ schools, on the police and so many others. The Afghan police were described to us recently as basically cannon fodder for the Taliban. I think many of us are still wondering, really, what it was that we ever thought we would achieve by going in. In terms of the international response, I welcome hearing the Commissioner talking about kick-starting cooperation and particularly mentioning India. The regional approach is important, and I look forward to hearing how we are going to deal with other areas of real tension, such as Kashmir, which the Afghan Ambassador told us the other day really provides a problem for everything that people try to do in the region. We also need, in Pakistan particularly, to be looking at what effective support we are offering in terms of the many thousands of displaced people, and learn from our lack of engagement with those who were displaced to the borders of Pakistan and Afghanistan in the past that a vacuum will be filled. Therefore, we really need to be paying attention to education and meeting the needs of the population who are also looking after those displaced people. Keith Taylor  (Verts/ALE

 Mr President, I speak with a request to postpone the vote on the maritime spatial planning item, from Tuesday, to allow for an accurate translation into Swedish. I am told that the existing translation is at best opaque and at worst misleading and incorrect. I am not aware of any problems with other languages, but that is not surprising. I have spoken with Ms Meissner, the rapporteur, who is in agreement with a postponement of the vote to allow more time for an accurate translation. I am sure you will agree that this is an important point. Members must be fully aware of the details and understand properly what they are voting on. So with that, I would like to formally ask for a delay on that vote. Keith Taylor,

 Mr President, I was the shadow for the Green Group on this. There was good technical harmonisation about connections, which was very welcome. I note average results from what I basically see as a fairly flawed regulation. Member States now have reasonable freedom to decide how and where they want to have the infrastructure and an extended amount of time to decide. The bad result is the lost opportunity to tie greenhouse gas emissions and pollution emissions to the alternative fuels. It is rather technologically blind. There is no reference to renewable energies or to public transport. We need to remember that we started off by trying to reduce emissions, but that does not really seem to feature in the ambition of this report. More could have been done, but the Greens will nevertheless support it from the point of view of technical harmonisation. Keith Taylor  (Verts/ALE
). - 
 Mr President, speaking as the Green shadow rapporteur on the De Backer report, we agree that any measures to improve road safety should be seriously investigated. The terrible death toll on European roads throws down a stark challenge to reduce deaths and injuries. However, our Group is not convinced that a mandatory EU-wide eCall system as currently prescribed is the best alternative. More lives could be saved, for example, if speed limits were cut by 10 km/hour. Such a policy would also be cheaper and would achieve real casualty reductions.  We have concerns about the possibility of the EU having to co-fund the system, about data protection issues, and the increased likelihood of false alarms through the automated systems. Finally, the suggestion that the driver of the vehicle should be able to turn off the machine seems to undermine and complicate the entire idea. My Group will not be supporting either of the reports.

 Mr President, colleagues, I speak to you today as the rapporteur on last year’s report on Regulation (EU) 261/2004 and Regulation (EU) 1008/2008 and also as the Green shadow for Mr Bach’s report today. I would like to thank the rapporteur for his very constructive approach, and I am very pleased to say that we have been able to change the emphasis in the Commission proposal from one which was largely pro-industry – pro-airline – to one which is much more pro-passenger, and that is the version we will vote on today. Although my Group’s view that compensation should be paid after one hour was not carried, a compromise of three hours was, and that also mirrors the European Court of Justice’s position of three hours as the trigger. So this is considerably better than the starting point of the Commission, which was five hours. We are also able to support the narrowing of the extraordinary circumstances to stop airlines hiding behind this excuse to avoid paying compensation to travellers to whom it is due. I am pleased to see the recommendations about better communication with passengers, and I also hope that implementation can be improved. In that regard, I think that our suggestion of independent mediation bodies will prove very useful.  Also, the environmental impact and energy efficiency of passengers’ travel will be provided on the website and on the tickets for the journey. We cannot expect people to be more responsible about carbon emissions if they do not know what the effect of their activities will be.  All in all I am very pleased to be able to support this report, and I would like to thank Mr Bach once more for his constructive approach. Keith Taylor  (Verts/ALE

 I supported this own-initiative report on Blue Growth. However, I regret that the report presents the view that the marine environment is only a section for consideration within Blue Growth, instead of presenting a healthy marine ecosystem as a fundamental prerequisite within which any other sectoral ‘blue’ policies operate. This disagreement with the report is a fundamental one, but I hope this issue is better addressed in other legislative proposals (e.g. on maritime spatial planning).  Whilst amendments which called for a ban on Arctic oil and gas exploration, and for ship emission limits, were not supported in TRAN, most of the report is fine, underlining the importance of key issues for the Green/EFA group: smart, sustainable and inclusive growth, based on an eco-system approach; using the precautionary principle to assess proposals; protecting sustainable maritime sea basin strategy and developing island and coastal tourism.  The report goes on to call for the development of opportunities for ‘clean ships’ that are more energy-efficient and produce less emissions, the construction of a North Sea Offshore Grid for renewable energy, more efficient use of resources and enhanced recycling policies (as an alternative to sea mining), and notes the employment opportunities this approach presents.

 Mr President, as the Greens’ shadow on this file I would like to thank the rapporteur, Brian Simpson, for his effective work. This was a standard procedure to adopt the Maritime Labour Convention (MLC) of 2006 into EU law and in so doing to secure seafarers’ rights and protection. We are going to be supporting this first reading agreement in view of the rapporteur’s call for non-regression. That means no existing standards of social legislation should be allowed to be lowered due to the adoption of this piece of legislation. The recommendations on non-ratification did not go as far as we wanted – our proposal wanted to put ships from flag States not signing the MLC into a higher risk category but this was not accepted. We did at least get an agreement that non-flag vessels would get ‘no more favourable treatment’ than ones sailing under the convention; in Article 3 of the amended directive. Keith Taylor,

 Madam President, the existing MDG framework has helped to galvanise development efforts and guide global and national priorities. Not all the targets have been met, but we have heard some significant targets have been met and that NGOs have found it very useful to have MDGs so that they can encourage their Member State governments to achieve better results. The current MDGs do not, however, sufficiently address the root causes of poverty, such as inequalities within and among countries, as well as issues such as social exclusion, biodiversity and governance.  We need a new approach post-2015 that embraces global governance, with a strong focus on policy coherence for development and the provision of global public goods. By that I mean understanding that global public goods will include international trade, environmental and financial architecture within the context of global governance. It is also important to have a human rights approach, and I am in agreement with most of what the report says. We need a more holistic approach reflecting the outcome of the Rio+20 Conference on sustainable development, and we need to develop the concept of development effectiveness: a combination of development aid, assistance for the provision of global goods and adaptation of governance structure. It is important that the global goals and targets are tailored and adapted to national and regional contexts. In conclusion, is important to say, with regard to recipient countries, that I am very pleased to see the Commissioner is saying we should stick to the 7% GNI target for overseas development aid. Keith Taylor  (Verts/ALE

 Madam President, the question from the Chair of the Committee on Transport and Tourism is timely and I suspect there is frustration behind it. There were no fewer than three separate reports which included reference to passengers’ hand luggage adopted in 2012. I was the author of the first report which concerned the functioning and application of established rights of people travelling by air and that report was adopted by a large majority.  Concerning hand luggage, we called on the Commission to propose measures which make it possible to harmonise commercial practice so as to protect passengers against excessive restrictions and to allow them to carry on board a reasonable amount of hand luggage. We have heard the horror stories of the travelling public; the Parliament has expressed its wishes. If I heard the Commissioner right, he is going to leave it up to the market and possibly the courts. I simply do not think that is good enough and I really want the Commission to respond to those three separate reports calling for a proactive action. Keith Taylor  (Verts/ALE

 I am bitterly disappointed that Parliament voted to endorse ACAA. I do not accept the disingenuous argument of the majority of the PPE and ALDE that this was a purely technical matter. It is clearly a political one. and this vote will send out the message that the EU favours increased trade with Israel over the welfare of hundreds of thousands of Palestinians who are daily subjected to a blockade of Gaza, illegal settlements on their territories, an apartheid wall and property evictions and demolitions. Trade can be a useful tool in development and peacemaking, but voting to accept ACAA is tantamount to endorsing the ongoing violations of international humanitarian and human rights law that Israel is inflicting on the Palestinian territories and people. Through this failure to provide consistency in the application of its fundamental principles, and only weeks after the EU was awarded the Nobel Peace Prize, Parliament is undermining its own, and the EU’s, credibility as a force for good in the world. It makes no sense. I will continue to contribute to peaceful settlement in this troubled region, and strive for justice for all. Keith Taylor  (Verts/ALE

 I did not support the vote to approve Parliament’s resolution on the 2013 EU Budget. Although there were measures within the budget I did support, the overall budget’s net increase of 6.8% over the 2012 levels at a time when states all over the EU are imposing austerity measures is something I cannot condone. I have previously voted to limit additional Member State contributions to the rate of inflation, and suggest a reappraisal of spending priorities for specific budget lines with any unspent money reallocated. Such funds could also be used to meet extra commitments resulting from new post-Treaty of Lisbon measures. A favourite area for funding cuts is the billions of euros spent on the ITER nuclear fusion budget. I believe this selective approach to be a more appropriate method for directing spending in times of financial hardship, rather than approving across-the-board blanket percentage increases. Keith Taylor,  
on behalf of the Verts/ALE Group. 
– Mr President, I should like to thank Mr Kazak for his report. The Greens appreciate that the Commission has come forward with this proposal for a general regulation on MFA. We have been asking for such a regulation for the last five years and now the question arises whether this proposal is still in time. Given that Parliament is about to start the revision of the existing financial instruments for the period 2014-2020, and given the limited size and importance of the MFA instrument, we wonder whether it might not be wise to integrate the MFA into the new European Neighbourhood Instrument from 2014 onwards. This instrument already provides for budget support and could accommodate conditionality. We would only need to integrate the MFA elements when blending grants and loans into the ENI framework, but this should be possible. For Greens this would seem to be the most elegant way to signal to our neighbourhood partners that we are still willing to support their balance of payments stability while solving the problem of how to make MFA more of a true EU structural adjustment programme. We sadly did not receive the support of the other political groups over this idea. Hence we will go with the rapporteur and we will be abstaining in the vote later on.

– I am extremely pleased that this report has been adopted, as it strengthens passenger rights across the board. However, in my original draft report, I urged the Commission to propose an obligation on air carriers to provide a final guarantee covering their liabilities towards passengers in the event of insolvency, bankruptcy or removal of an operating licence. The reference to a final guarantee was weakened at the vote in the Transport and Tourism Committee, confining the proposal to support for stranded passengers to be repatriated in the event of insolvency, bankruptcy, ceased operations or removal of an operating licence. Although I welcome this measure, it is not as strong as the original wording, and I call on the Commission to look into the possibility of proposing a final guarantee to protect passengers when they revise Regulation No 261/2004.

 Mr President, as the standing rapporteur for (sound disappears
), I am particularly concerned by the situation in Kazakhstan where, as we are hearing from many other speakers, fundamental rights continue to be violated. I find it completely unacceptable that, following his recent meeting here in Strasbourg with MEPs to discuss the tragedy in Zhanaozen, Vladimir Kozlov, the leader of the opposition political party, Alga, was arrested by the Kazakh Committee of National Security on his return to the country. Mr Kozlov, as well as other political opponents of the government, was sentenced and put in prison. More recently, I have also met with some Kazakh civil society activists, including Mrs Kozlov, and I was extremely concerned to hear that Mr Kozlov has recently undergone surgery while in prison but that his current state of health is not known. Nobody, including his wife, is allowed any contact with him. Journalists I have also met have been intimidated and threatened with arrest if they write anything against the regime in Kazakhstan. So I think we should call on the Kazakh authorities to end the clampdown on the political opposition and independent media in the country and to immediately release all people incarcerated on politically motivated grounds. Keith Taylor,  
on behalf of the Verts/ALE Group.

 Madam President, Parliament started to draft a resolution on this, led by the Committee on Transport and Tourism, for which I am the Green shadow. We recognise that maritime piracy is an extremely complicated and problematic issue, but we also believe that it is a horizontal one, incorporating development, security and foreign affairs aspects, while the link with transport issues is more secondary. I am given to understand that the reason why the Transport Committee is the leading committee is because the Commission’s Directorate-General for Mobility and Transport wants to lead on this instead of DG Development. Greens are completely against this shift, as solutions to maritime piracy do not lie primarily with changes to transport policy. Therefore, we welcome the fact that this resolution was taken off the agenda for this plenary session. If Parliament is determined to have a resolution on this, we think it should be led by another committee such as the Subcommittee on Security and Defence, as well as being better timed in order to tie in with the external work and developments. Apart from the fact that we do not think that the Transport Committee should be leading on this issue, the solutions in the draft resolution are not in line with previous Parliament resolutions on piracy, Somalia and the Horn of Africa. Furthermore, they are too militarily based. We are against further militarisation and strongly in favour of strengthening the criminal justice approach to piracy, as advocated by the United Nations Special Advisor on Piracy, Mr Jack Lang. This, ultimately, would also need a change in any future resolution from this place on this issue. Keith Taylor,  
author. 
– Mr President, the end of the death penalty has been achieved in 96 countries across the world and only 23 countries actually carried out executions in 2010. To see any reduction in the numbers of legal killings is encouraging, but hearing about the possibility that executions in Japan will restart under a new Minister of Justice is a matter of great disappointment, both for me and for my political group, the Greens, who are completely opposed to the death penalty. According to reports from Amnesty and the UN Committee on Torture, most of those people sentenced to death in Japan have given confessions under extreme duress. That duress could include physical abuse or sleep deprivation or denial of food and water and the use of a toilet and not being told of the date of their execution until the day itself arrives. But the death penalty is not fail-safe. You cannot acquit someone if they have already been killed. So I think the death penalty is abhorrent and cruel; it degrades both Japanese society and morality and it further punishes the prisoners’ families, who are innocent of any crime. So please join us in voting for a moratorium and the reactivation of the Japanese study group to stop death penalties. Keith Taylor  (Verts/ALE
),

 I voted for this joint resolution concerning the 8-9 December 2011 Summit as it: suggested that financial and economic consolidation could be achieved through EU law, not Intergovernmental Agreements (IA) or EU treaties; recognised the draft IA did not reflect European Parliament (EP) priorities; supported a stronger role for democratic input from the EP and welcomed inclusion of a parliamentary working group and gave all EU members (including the UK) participation rights in discussions. The draft IA is still being developed, and already there are moves from Member States to dilute the fiscal requirements identified at the December summit (including the so-called ‘golden rule’). For the Single Currency to work there needs to be strong economic and fiscal union between Eurozone (EZ) members. I am not yet convinced that the EZ states will finally agree to necessary strict controls, and I am glad the UK is not part of it. I believe it is in the UK’s best interests to have a strong and stable euro, given that 40% of our trade is with EZ countries. For that reason, and the fact it was the only option achievable at this stage, I supported the resolution. Keith Taylor,  
on behalf of the Verts/ALE Group. 
– Madam President, I would like to take this opportunity on behalf of the Green Group to thank Mr Fleckenstein and other political shadows for the very positive way in which this report developed. There was much to agree on and little to dispute, and that was because we believe that EMSA is doing a very good job. I was particularly pleased to see three elements in this report. The first was an increased role for the European Maritime Safety Agency in the monitoring of offshore oil and gas installations; the second, increased preparedness to provide a response to maritime accidents; and the third, an increase in partnership working to deliver maritime surveillance, including the SafeSeaNet programme, hopefully linking up with some of the policies recently approved in our integrated maritime policy. I did attend an EMSA conference in their new centre in Lisbon, and I must say I was very impressed with the breadth of their operations and their commitment to delivering safety on the sea. I commend this report to you and thank Mr Fleckenstein. Keith Taylor,  
on behalf of the Verts/ALE Group. 
– Mr President, the Greens on the Committee on International Trade fully support the report’s position, which is calling for Uzbekistan to take concrete and convincing measures to eradicate child labour before the Parliament can give consent to textiles being covered by the Partnership and Cooperation Agreement. I think it is perfectly right that we should be withholding European Parliament consent to this Protocol with Uzbekistan until those breaches have been stopped. In relation to the textiles, there is clear evidence of state-sanctioned, systematic and widespread forced labour in the Uzbek cotton fields. Schools are being closed during the harvest period and thousands upon thousands of school children are being forced to work in the fields collecting cotton. This is not the treatment that any child should have to tolerate. We would not tolerate it for our children. Those children in Uzbekistan are our children; we should have a responsibility for them. Keith Taylor,  
on behalf of the Verts/ALE Group.
 – Madam President, the Greens support the measures contained in the Koumoutsakos report today, and welcome the opportunity we have for an agreement at first reading. It is necessary – as has been so eloquently pointed out by other speakers – to provide some interim funding so that proper allocations can start from 2013. As it happens, we were unable to secure the amount originally envisaged, but nevertheless there is EUR 40 million available from unspent budget allocations. That money will go towards integrating maritime policy around the development of short sea shipping, the detection of illegal fishing, the integration of sea-basin strategies and maritime surveillance and, importantly, protection of the marine environment. We have particularly enjoyed working with the rapporteur. We now welcome the opportunity to work in partnership with other agencies, notably the European Maritime Safety Agency with its SafeSeaNet programme. Colleagues, please use your vote later today to support this jolly good idea. Keith Taylor  (Verts/ALE

 I did not support the vote to approve the EU Budget 2012 resolution in the EP this week. Within the budget there were measures I supported, such as increased funding for the EU 2020 work, the greening of the CAP, and for Palestine, as well as reducing business flights and freezing MEPs’ daily allowances. However, the overall budget net increase of 5.3% over 2011 levels, at a time when States all over the EU are imposing austerity measures, is something I cannot condone. I voted in June 2011 to limit increases in Member State contributions in line with inflation, and suggested specific budget lines should be revised, and unspent money reallocated. I remain of this view. Keith Taylor,

 Madam President, I rise to speak in favour of Ms Koppa’s resolution. Like many others, I have witnessed the twists and turns in the quest for Palestinian statehood in the United Nations, and like many others I wish them well and hope for a fair and just solution. In speaking today on the Koppa report it is, for me, not a question of being anti-Israel or pro-Palestine. No: it is more one of championing justice and fair play. We must hope that peace soon comes to this troubled region. I spent a few days in the Gaza Strip this summer seeing for myself the abject poverty in which Gazans have to live. I listened to the pleas of mothers and fathers unable to feed or educate their children properly, and of doctors and workers who have to work with the most basic of materials. I listened to teachers and their students, refugees and NGOs, and I heard countless stories of stalled business deals, of jobs lost through lack of raw materials, of social breakdown and the strangulation of trade by the Israeli blockade. It became very clear to me that in Gaza and in the West Bank economic recovery and social recovery go hand in hand. We have some misgivings in our Group about the nature of the agreement, the dislocation of development in social and environmental protection, and some of the practical difficulties around identifying the sources of products. The Koppa report will not solve all the problems between Israel and Palestine; but it is an important marker along the way. As the rapporteur states, opening the EU market to Palestinian products is only the first stage in the construction of a Palestinian state. I urge you to join us in the vote tomorrow in Parliament. Keith Taylor  (Verts/ALE

Madam President, I would just like to say thank you to Dieter Koch for the way we have been able to develop these road safety ideas in shadows’ meetings. Halving the casualty figures is a commendable target. As has just been said, every single death is a personal tragedy for someone. I am particularly pleased that we have managed to tackle the three major causes of accidents: alcohol, drugs and speed. We have got here a uniform blood-alcohol level for the whole EU; we have a strong recommendation for 20 mile-an-hour zones or 30 kilometre-an-hour zones in urban areas; we have got safe routes to schools; we have got measures to avoid lorry blind spots. We all have a chance to improve road safety for all road users. Please vote tomorrow to make that happen. Keith Taylor,

 Mr President, earlier in this session we heard a moving statement about the tenth anniversary of the terrible attack on the World Trade Centre. The other anniversary is that of the start of the Doha Round of negotiations towards a trade agreement. I would say that this in fact has killed millions of people – the people in the greatest poverty – or shortened their lives. I think that if we look at the responsibility for that, we see that the WTO has not fulfilled its aspirations to meet the Millennium Development Goals. It has failed the less developed countries in its belief in free trade. What we have in this resolution today is recognition that the Doha Round is dead in the water. It needs to be concluded as swiftly as possible with a package for the less developed countries. We need to concentrate on multilateral agreements because every single bilateral or plurilateral agreement tends to put trade into smaller regional or subregional blocks, and this undermines the multilateral direction which this Parliament believes is the right way to go. Furthermore, I am very pleased to see that the resolution calls for a reform of the WTO, because it is simply no longer fit for purpose. It needs to be revised around the principles of democracy and – bearing in mind that the WTO has never taken a single vote on anything, as it is all done by consensus – it needs to have transparency and accountability. Our Group believes that the wholesale enthusiasm for free trade has ultimately not delivered the promised benefits. We believe that we should be basing WTO reform around trade justice and sustainable development, which should be the watchwords as we develop a new trade body for the planet. Keith Taylor,  
on behalf of the Verts/ALE Group.

 Madam President, this motion is badly needed. Even though we have the 2006 directive, it is plain that it is not working as well as it should. The companies we have heard of exist solely to swindle unsuspecting and sometimes over-stretched organisations, and I find that particularly outrageous when they are damaging community enterprises, often with limited budgets. Using tactics like those of bully-boys and racketeers, they dangle promises in front of unsuspecting people, but I think the message has got to be that if an offer seems to be too good to be true, then most probably it is. These companies are like predatory sharks and they should be stopped. Certainly, our group welcomes this resolution, it is very timely and we will be supporting it, as it calls on the Commission to require Member States to adequately enforce the directive. Keith Taylor  (Verts/ALE
),

– I will be supporting an amendment in the Multiannual Financial Framework (MFF) report which limits Member State EU contributions to the rate of inflation (currently 3.2%) or below, as suggested by the Heads of State of the UK, France, Germany, Netherlands and Finland. The MMF Garriga Report seeks to increase funding from Member States for the period 2014-2020 by 5%, and this I cannot support at a time when extreme adversity is being experienced in the UK from the government’s dangerous and socially divisive austerity measures. I do support many of the measures promoted in the report and in the Green’s amendments, particularly around the Green New Deal, the end of national rebates and Own Resources for the EU, and am mindful that part of the above-inflation increase is needed to meet obligations under the Lisbon Treaty. There are, however, many expensive budget lines remaining in the MFF that shouldn’t be supported, and I’m thinking of the EUR 6.6 billion to be spent on nuclear fusion as just one example. My argument is that if there isn’t enough funding after inflation-only increases in Member State contributions, ways should be found to re-allocate budget lines to meet any shortfalls. Keith Taylor,  
on behalf of the Verts/ALE Group. 
– Madam President, as others have mentioned, Canada is indeed a solid trading partner for the EU. The abolition of the tariffs now being negotiated in the CETA framework is, on the whole, acceptable to our group. But sadly, CETA does come up with some other demands and political goals which we find deeply worrying. I will mention two of the most troublesome, the first being the negative list in the negotiations on trade liberalisation. Normally, in negotiating FTAs, you name the services that you are ready to liberalise. But under these proposals, all services are open, except those specifically excluded at the outset. As Greens, we think there are some services, particularly those dealing with the general public interest, which are too sensitive and too potentially vulnerable to be negotiated under this ‘negative list’ approach. We have lodged some amendments and we are looking forward to some support from fellow Members. The other area of concern is around procurement. We are concerned about the impact that CETA will have on procurement. To give just one example, the Ontario Green Energy Act would be illegal under CETA. That Act promotes the production and feeding of renewable energies and directs investments into local economies. That is just one example of how CETA will interfere with domestic policy in Canada. Although Canada is one of our oldest trading partners, we cannot deny that occasionally, we do have differences of opinion. Canada is, for instance, opposed to the EU’s GMO policies. It is starting WTO action against the EU import ban on seals, in addition to its barbaric annual seal cull, and do not forget that it is fighting the EU Fuel Quality Directive to protect its exports of tar sands to the EU. I believe that it is important that we voice all these concerns and urge the Commission to remain firm in the principles and policies of this place. Keith Taylor  (Verts/ALE
),

 When we first heard in October 2010 of the Commission’s plans to help Pakistan recover from its awful flooding by removing some customs tariffs, Greens were enthusiastic to help. We still are, but a once-simple idea has become over-complicated and unworkable. Originally the scheme was for 3 years, although we wanted longer to increase investor confidence. But after various business and interest groups had got involved the proposal was reduced to 12 months only – with quarterly reviews! Further, any deal needs a waiver from the World Trade Organisation, which they haven’t approved as some member countries (notably India) are worried about the effect that duty-free Pakistani textiles would have on their own markets. There has been no progress in 5 months, and it’s unlikely we’ll see any soon, if ever. In Plenary today I supported an amendment to send the whole report back to committee for re-working. In doing so I wasn’t voting against helping Pakistan, but I was recognising the report before us simply wouldn’t deliver what Pakistan needs. For me, a major stumbling block has been the WTO. I believe this organisation needs comprehensive reorganisation into a properly democratic, accountable and transparent body. Keith Taylor,  
on behalf of the Verts/ALE Group. 
– Mr President, I, like many others in this House, share the concern for, and the sympathy with, the people affected by the terrible floods in Pakistan. I did so at the time and I do now. However, when I look at how the political will has been lacking, how the corporate interests have interfered and how the WTO has procrastinated, what I see before us are recommendations that dilute the original proposals put forward at such short notice by the Commission. Mention has already been made of the short timescale for the trade preference relaxation, reduced from three years to one year: Pakistan is prevented from maintaining or increasing duties or charges within that time. Moreover, it is proposed to seek not only an annual report on a one-year programme but also quarterly reports on the application and implementation of the measures. This adds up to a huge bureaucracy being created, only to come to an end within one year. So I have a great deal of sympathy with the proposal, which is Amendment 43, to send this back to the committee so that we can come up with something which will actually deliver the help we want to give to Pakistan. Finally, I think this really does point to the acute need to look at how the WTO works and to transform it into a properly democratic body whose proceedings are transparent and whose members are accountable. Keith Taylor,  
on behalf of the Verts/ALE Group. 
– Madam President, it is quite desirable to review the trading arrangements that we have with other countries and it is quite understandable that Japan sees the FTA as particularly attractive in relation to the recent Korea FTA. There is a lot that we can support in the EPP-ALDE-ECR resolution but I think that they are making a mistake to ‘strongly support’ an FTA. That is a direct quote from paragraph 2. I think that is premature support when we do not have impact assessments on the environmental and social effects of an FTA. They are predicting the answer before identifying the effects of implementing the solution. Many people have commented about the non-tariff barriers and the work that has yet to be done by the high-level group. I think that needs a positive step forward. When we bear in mind the importance of Japan as a trading partner – with bilateral trade with the EU standing at EUR 120 billion a year, and with the EU being the number three trading partner for Japan and the number two investor in Japan – I think we recognise that any bilateral agreement runs the risk of undermining multilateral agreements with the rest of the world and, in particular, with the developing countries. So I think that strong unconditional support for an FTA needs to be revised. Finally, I would like to say that, whilst we have every sympathy with Japan, future trade policies simply cannot be based on who has had the most recent natural disaster. Keith Taylor  (Verts/ALE
).  
– Mr President, I rise to speak in favour of the financial transaction tax (FTT). The FTT provides an opportunity to redress the balance and the damage caused by the austerity measures, the deficit and the measures adopted to repay it. It is important, though, to introduce taxation which is relevant to the current circumstances since, in the UK for example, Barclays Bank only paid GBP 113 million in corporation tax in 2009, at well below the UK rate of 28%, while the Royal Bank of Scotland allocated EUR 25 billion to tax avoidance schemes that year and cost the British and US exchequer EUR 500 million in lost revenue. In the UK, a group has been formed to support the FTT. It is called the Robin Hood Tax group, after the legendary figure who stole from the rich and gave to the poor. I support its campaign, and I urge Parliament to do likewise. Keith Taylor,  
on behalf of the Verts/ALE Group. 
– Mr President, I was the Green/EFA shadow for both the Saïfi and the Désir reports. We welcome these as important steps forward to secure better human rights and social and environmental standards in the countries that are our trading partners. If those countries want to sell on the lucrative EU markets, we should encourage them to adopt decent and sustainable standards at home. Securing improvement through mandatory clauses and requirements in trade agreements is one way to achieve this. Mrs Saïfi, who did an excellent job as rapporteur, discusses constructively the different levels and aspects of human rights, and environmental and social standards at differing levels. We agree with Ms Saïfi’s suggestion that a world environment organisation be formed and that the ILO status should be strengthened. We liked the sustainable development chapter in FTAs but wish those standards to be binding, not voluntary. Similarly, the GSP schemes should be given proper teeth and be enforceable. But we could not agree with the rapporteur that the human rights clause in the FTA with Colombia was satisfactory. In fact we thought that was a meaningless, formulaic human rights clause that makes a mockery of the aspirations of this House in that regard. Turning to Mr Désir’s report, we could not agree more with him when he names the transnational corporations as a source of negative effects on the environment and on our social standards. They have profited from trade liberalisation and they have exploited cheap labour – and, all too often, cheap materials – but failed to adequately redistribute the wealth they have created at others’ expense. We have successfully amended both reports, and will be supporting both of them when it comes to the vote. In closing, I would very quickly stress that more needs to be done in specifying the human rights and social responsibilities we want to prioritise. We should do so in terms of obligatory requirements and not rely on voluntary codes. Keith Taylor,  
on behalf of the Verts/ALE Group. –
 Mr President, on behalf of the Verts/ALE Group I would like to thank the rapporteur, Mrs Meissner, for drawing together this report and developing it alongside the other political groups. As 71% of the Earth’s surface is covered with water, it really does make sense to try and develop an integrated maritime policy. Europe, of course, has 305 000 kilometres of coastline. That was the Commission’s intent back in 2009 when it announced a more horizontal policy approach on areas such as maritime transport, the marine environment and regional and fisheries policies. Today we see the response of the Committee on Transport and Tourism to this fresh direction, in the shape of Mrs Meissner’s report. We will be supporting this report. It is a useful step in the right direction towards caring for, and the sustainable use of, our maritime resource. However, we believe there is still much work to be done. We welcome the report’s suggestions on maritime governance, on sea basin initiatives and strategies, on maritime spatial planning and surveillance, a maritime research framework and observation and data network, and a fund for maritime infrastructure. I am particularly pleased that the report now includes the integration of carbon emission reduction targets and support for renewable solar and wind energies on board vessels. When it comes to the votes later on today, I would particularly like to ask Members to support the rapporteur’s amendment which seeks to include the option of including emission trading schemes in the EU and IMO rules. This was an issue over which the Committee on Transport was evenly split, with 20 votes each side, so it is perfectly right that Mrs Meissner has brought it here today for plenary to vote on. I would ask Members to show some ‘20-20 vision’ and vote for the rapporteur’s amendment, which recognises that these measures sit squarely alongside our wider strategic objectives around CO2
 reduction and the Europe 2020 project. Keith Taylor  (Verts/ALE
),

– I voted in favour of a legislative proposal guaranteeing enhanced and extended paternity/maternity pay in Parliament today. I did so after lobbying from supporters and opponents. I am well aware of the financial conditions in the UK, which will be further worsened by recent budget announcements of more spending cuts. Nevertheless, the European Parliament was in favour of 20 weeks’ maternity leave at full salary, and 2 weeks’ paternity leave, and I believe that this is a sensible investment in the economy, helping reach the EU target of 75% labour participation by 2020. It improves the health of babies and protects the health and welfare of mothers. It is a step to close the existing gender pay gap. On average, in the EU, women earn 17% less than men. If we do not guarantee decent wages during maternity leave, women are punished in their earnings for having children. It is also a positive encouragement to increase fathers' involvement in caring for children. Apart from death and taxes, birth is the only certainty in life. Our children are the future and the improvements voted through today will provide a better and more secure start to their lives. Keith Taylor  (Verts/ALE
).  
– Madam President, I would like to add my support for this oral question, as I find it totally unacceptable for the United States, Canada and Mexico to be seeking to challenge the inclusion of aviation in the EU emissions trading system. In any event, many people believe those aviation conditions from 2012 to be modest in comparison to what we should and could have been able to achieve. For example, this sector will still be allowed to access carbon credits from other industries, and the cap on aviation emissions is nowhere near as challenging as that demanded from other sectors. Including aviation here is at least a step in the right direction, and ends the legislative vacuum it has enjoyed for too long, to the extent that it is the fastest growing source of carbon emissions. Surely the principle of the polluter pays has never been more well deserved than in this instance. In closing, I would say that we must not let established EU decisions be jeopardised by third countries. I urge the Commission and the Council to clearly state that they intend to fully respect the properly adopted EU law in the upcoming ICAO discussions. Keith Taylor  (Verts/ALE

 I welcome the decision of MEPs from across the political spectrum to support this strong resolution condemning Israel for its unprovoked and disproportionate attacks on the Free Gaza humanitarian aid flotilla. I understand that this was the strongest position that Parliament could adopt as a whole, due to differences in position between and within different political groups, and to have such a unified position sends a very clear and unambiguous message to Israel and the international community. Despite voting in favour of the resolution, however, I would have liked it to go even further. Immediately following the attack on the flotilla, I wrote to Commissioner Cathy Ashton, calling for an immediate suspension of the EU Israel Association agreement. Israel has consistently breached the human rights clause of this agreement and its latest move should not be tolerated. I believe that we need actions as well as words from the EU to show that the international community deplores both the siege on Gaza and Israel’s attack on the Free Gaza flotilla. I will continue to call for the suspension of this agreement whenever the opportunity arises, until Israel can demonstrate that it is upholding its human rights obligations towards Palestine.
