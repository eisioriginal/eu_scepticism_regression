 Mr President, the subject of today's debate is not whether or not we should sign up to the Århus Convention. As the Community signed this text in 1998, it is now our responsibility to act so that each of our governments can implement this agreement. By signing the Århus Convention, the Community has committed itself to adopting legally binding instruments, namely a directive and a regulation, in order to bring Community legislation in line with the provisions of the Århus Convention. It was with this requirement to comply with the Convention in mind that the committee carried out its work. It is also along these lines that the amendments tabled in plenary, which are widely supported, were drawn up. Our work initially consisted in uniting the various concepts taken up in the texts and in adapting them to the definitions in the Convention. On the other hand, we have respected the Commission's decision to give non-governmental organisations working in the environmental sector access to justice, while further opening up this route to qualified entities with legal personality. In the same vein, we have turned the objective of promoting sustainable development into an essential condition, included in their statues, of exercising the right of access to justice. Furthermore, only the provisions contained in the Århus Convention and in the directive granted access to justice to members of the public who bring to light an infringement of a right or who have an interest in acting. As we were anxious that the Community institutions should be bound by the same rules as the Member States, we chose to incorporate this provision into the present regulation. Finally, we constantly ensured that we respected the need to apply the principle of subsidiarity to the Member States with regard to legal procedures. Indeed, insofar as these matters relate to procedural law in the Member States, they are based on the Member States' procedural autonomy and must not result in a restrictive legal instrument from the Union. It is also inconceivable that we could establish a specific provision, a sort of privileged right to easier and cheaper access to justice on environmental matters: it is essential for questions of access to justice to be dealt with consistently and on an overall basis in all sectors, not just specifically in the environmental sector. Finally, some of the proposals in the working document go beyond the obligations arising from the Århus Convention. We must retain the room for manoeuvre that the Convention gives the Member States in the implementation of these obligations. To conclude, I think we have reached a fair compromise which aims to promote, in accordance with the provisions of the Århus Convention, effective implementation of Community legislation on the environment. I could, perhaps, summarise it by saying ‘the whole Århus Convention, and nothing but the Århus Convention’.

 Mr President, first of all, I would like to thank Mr Brok for the high quality of the work he has carried out enabling us to vote today on a decisive text in our history. I fully support the general approach taken by this report and the encouragement it contains. In my own report, however, I have taken the liberty of dwelling at greater length on certain factors which are fundamental to the creation of the internal market. First of all, I have discussed the need for the judicial and administrative systems in the candidate countries to be truly independent. Much remains to be done in terms of selection, training and evaluation procedures for judges. Furthermore, coherent reform of the public administrations must be a priority objective. Impartiality is essential in these areas. Secondly, the free movement of persons, which is a cornerstone of the internal market, is all too often blocked, in particular by the lack of recognition of occupational qualifications. Lastly, I would encourage our future Member States to step up their efforts to combat counterfeit and pirated goods, for that is the key to achieving compliance with intellectual and industrial property rights. The factors that I have just mentioned are all elements with regard to which the European Parliament is committed to remaining vigilant. This vigilance is possible thanks to the measures established at the appropriate times by the European Commission over previous periods and following accession. Safeguard clauses specifically linked to the internal market may be implemented in the event of failure to comply with the obligations arising from accession and invoked as a warning prior to accession. It should be made clear that these clauses create an additional safety net. I would also invite the Commission to update us on progress in these matters in its final report, due to be presented in November 2003. Lastly, I would like to emphasise the importance of this time and of 16 April next. Sadly, the past few days have been coloured by the conflict in Iraq, by the positions taken by governments in Central and Eastern Europe, and, lastly, by the problem of funding enlargement. Failure to give our assent, however, would send an extremely unfortunate signal to the candidate countries, where referendums are underway. The timetable must be observed. We must make room for our common future.

 Mr President, Commissioner, I wish, first of all, to congratulate Mr Sterckx on his excellent report, which is well-researched, balanced and constructive. Nunca máis
! [Never again!] This is the relevant phrase and the proper aim for maritime disasters, which have serious ecological, economic and human costs, such as oil slicks, for example. Nevertheless, there is still a long way to go to improve maritime safety. At European level and following the sinking of the Erika
, the Commission proposed an entire set of measures that are appropriate and bold – the Erika I and Erika II packages – in order to prevent similar disasters. These measures would clearly have enabled us to prevent to another oil slick from occurring. You have been extremely bold, Commissioner, and entirely right. Unfortunately, due to the reprehensible shilly-shallying of some Member States, these Erika I and Erika II packages only entered into force this year and only on 23 July at that. The Commission has opened legal proceedings against ten Member States that have failed to meet their obligations to notify. In any event, these measures entered into force far too late to prevent the Prestige
 disaster and the heavy fuel that it was transporting is still polluting coasts from Galicia to Brittany, including my own region, Aquitaine, with the extremely serious consequences of which we are all aware. We already know that the proposed compensation will cover only a tiny part of the damage that has been caused. There have been so many human tragedies and so many barely healed wounds, and this is why it is crucial to find out what decision has been taken to recover the thousands of tonnes of fuel that remain in the wreck of the Prestige
. There is an urgent obligation to clarify this matter. Furthermore, we know that the compensation proposed by the International Oil Pollution Compensation Funds (FIPOL) will only cover a tiny part of the damage that has been caused. I therefore call on the Commission and the Council to do everything within their power to ensure that the European Supplementary Fund for Compensation for Oil Pollution Damage, the COPE Fund proposed by the Erika II package is implemented in order to provide additional aid. Many documents have been published on the Prestige
 disaster and, for this reason, I wish to quote from the remarkable report drawn up by the French National Assembly. The European Parliament, for its part, has held two hearings with the European Commission and enquiries are still ongoing. Legal proceedings have been opened in both France and Spain, and elsewhere, to establish the true circumstances of the shipwreck and the responsibilities of the various actors involved in this tragedy. In my view, those who are recommending a committee of inquiry into the Prestige
 are doing so for political reasons. We must look to the future; to prevention, and not make political capital out of this tragic affair. This is why, as a Member of the European Parliament, my thoughts are primarily with the victims and therefore to prevent, first and foremost, further disasters from occurring. I hope to forge ahead on this matter and this is why I tabled an amendment, accepted by my group, calling for a temporary committee to be set up, with the task of assessing the effectiveness of the Erika I and II packages, in order to prevent any further disasters and, if necessary, to propose strengthening them. There are many questions to which we and the general public wish to have answers and it is time that answers were provided. What is position of the Member States’? How reliable are double-hulled ships? What progress has been made on the concept of safe havens, to which Mr Sterckx referred earlier? The temporary committee will be able to answer this question and others and to provide reassurance; that is its sole purpose. I hope that you will be able to look beyond the political differences and agree, on this extremely important subject, to support this forward-looking initiative. This is still the best way of proclaiming Nunca máis
! [Never again!]

 Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, I should first like to extend my sympathies to all of the regions in the south of Europe that have been devastated by terrible fires. This is a true human, environmental and economic tragedy. As you said, Commissioner, repairing the damage is more expensive than preventing it: we therefore need to give prevention the consideration and funding that it deserves. In this respect, I can report that creating networks in the forests of Aquitaine by building tracks, firebreaks and ditches, by increasing the number of water supply points and by appointing fire spotters has made it possible to limit the spread of nascent fires very considerably. These preventive measures were funded in particular by a European regulation dedicated to protecting forests against fire, Regulation 2158/92/EEC, which unfortunately expired at the end of 2002. In spite of the indisputable beneficial effects of this regulation, the Commission – as many of us have pointed out – has transferred only the fire surveillance aspect to its 'Forest Focus' proposal. As for the prevention part, it has been incorporated into rural development, where funding is a great deal more uncertain. This shows the Commission's intention to abandon wholesale a European policy of defending forests against fire and to renationalise this policy. To do so is, I believe, a political, economic and environmental mistake. Well before the terrible fires of this summer – note, well before – and more specifically on 29 April, I wrote to the President of the European Commission, Romano Prodi, to tell him how astonished I was by the Commission's position. At first reading, the Commission had in fact spoken in favour of rejecting Parliament's amendments integrating fire prevention in 'Forest Focus'. In response, all I received was a reassertion of this position, which I regard at the very least as surprising. At a time when the European Parliament is preparing to reopen discussions on the 'Forest Focus' proposal at its second reading, we need to do all we can to include fire-prevention measures in 'Forest Focus'. When it comes to the Community budget, this funding is a drop in the ocean, but, Commissioner, it is a drop of water that will enable many fires to be extinguished.

 Mr President, I too feel that these are just excuses. Transport problems provide an easy excuse. We all have difficulties with transport, whether we are coming here to Strasbourg or going to Brussels. There is ample proof of this in the statements made in this House a few months ago. One Member saw rats everywhere, and so on ... I think that we should now stop all this and start being serious and, as Mr Bourlanges has just said, we should take the bull by the horns and respect the Treaties.

 Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, the immense difficulties that we are experiencing reveal existing trends which we should not overlook. The historic and privileged links between Great Britain and the United States are nothing new. The Atlanticist attitude of the candidate countries is based on our own weaknesses and on the fact that they do not believe that Europe is capable of defending them. Unfortunately they are right. It is high time that conclusions were drawn from this crisis, which is perhaps a salutary one, like the ones which preceded it and which allowed us to move forward. Perhaps we shall finally find an answer to the question of what we want to do together. There are, in fact, two opposing visions of Europe. The first is the vision of those who are in favour simply of a large area of economic freedom, while foreign and defence policies are aligned with those of the United States and NATO. The second is the vision of a Europe which is powerful not only economically but politically as well, and which plays a full role in the world, in partnership with its allies and not under their tutelage. For the latter Europe, which is the one that I would like to see, a common foreign and defence policy is essential. If we have the political will to achieve it, this common defence will constitute a formidable potential for union and will finally enable us to harmonise our human and material resources in every field, and particularly in research, weapons systems and information, which will have inestimable civil, economic and social repercussions. This is why I wholeheartedly agree with the conclusions of the work carried out by Commissioner Barnier in connection with the Convention, and also, above all, with the excellent report by General Morillon. He has treated this highly sensitive subject with the competence for which he is famous, but also with tact and sensitivity. We must now come together again and move forward, if possible. I have not forgotten the Saint-Malo summit, which some people try to pretend never happened. If those people continue to prefer to take to the high seas, I hope they will use a big sail. One day, I am convinced of it, they will return to our shores. We, the others, who constitute by far the greater majority, prefer a Europe which is free, solidarity-based and credible, a Europe which also makes its influence felt in matters involving peace and the destiny of the world. This is the desire of many countries in the world, countries which expect Europe to play its role. It is also, I know, the desire of the people of Europe, as so many of them have been demonstrating in the last few weeks.

 Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, first of all I should like to bow my head and turn my thoughts to the civil and military victims on all sides, and say that I deeply regret all the suffering caused in the opening days of the war. Let us hope that it will come to a speedy end. Generally speaking, this conflict brings three thoughts to my mind. Firstly, how can we learn from our differences, so that the European Union can find itself again at last, and can speak with a united voice in international affairs? The European Union was built up over time and through various trials. More often than not, great advances have followed serious crises. The trial that Europe is currently passing through is not the first and it will certainly not be the last. and we must therefore be optimistic. The most important thing is to examine and to understand, after the war, the reasons for our present differences. Are they fundamental reasons? Are our positions irreversible and irreconcilable? If they are, that will cause serious difficulties in the future. Is it not more likely that they are merely the result of a lack of consultation and coordination? It seems to me that it is now a matter of urgency that Europe, without harming its transatlantic partnership, should provide itself with the means of being independent and powerful, and should provide itself with a real common foreign and defence policy. Independence does not mean breaking alliances. My second thought is about the future of Iraq. This time, the United Nations must fully play its part in the reconstruction of Iraq, so that the country can provide itself with a representative government which is willing to live in peace with its neighbours and is capable of playing an active part within the international community. Reconstruction must be carried out, first and foremost, for the benefit of the Iraqi people who have suffered so much for so many years. The Iraqis must at last be able to benefit from their country’s wealth, which is enormous. Thirdly, I wonder whether we have the capacity to give an appropriate welcome to the candidate countries next year. Are we ready? That is what we should be asking ourselves. In order to welcome the candidate countries in the best possible circumstances, it seems that three conditions will need to be met. Firstly, we need to be reconciled on the subject of our values. Why should those not be the values of the old Europe? Secondly, our institutions, which find it difficult enough to operate when there are only fifteen Member States, need to be changed, and that means that the Convention must complete its work in the best possible conditions. Thirdly, we have to be able to cope financially. I have set out the problem, but it is not my job to provide the solution to it. My most cherished hope is that, after this war and after we have passed through this crisis, the Union, whether it has fifteen or twenty-five Member States, will be independent and finally able to speak with a single voice.

 Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, everyone will understand if, at the beginning of this debate, I express my feelings of sorrow, deep compassion and solidarity to the fishermen and fish farmers of the Atlantic coast, with whom I deal on a daily basis. The omens at the start of 2003 are very sad. I want to talk again for a moment about the growing importance of the aquaculture sector. In the course of the last ten years, in fact, aquaculture has seen spectacular growth throughout the world, as well as in the European Community, and has become a high–growth sector in world food production. In the EU, aquaculture accounts for almost 30% of the total value of fisheries production, almost EUR three billion per year and 60 000 jobs. It has many advantages, but I prefer to focus upon the three most important of these: the fact that it contributes significantly to the fish supply without increasing the pressure on stocks in the marine environment; that it is a source of jobs in regions with little alternative employment; and, finally, the fact that it will be able, I am convinced, to help maintain natural resources once wild species are being conserved. The report that has been entrusted to me and that I have the honour to present today before this Assembly is focused upon what seems to me to be the most important aspect of aquaculture: sustainable development. Certain fish–farming activities are indeed very often seen as polluting or are thought to harm the environment. That is less and less the case, since professional fish farmers respect what are sometimes draconian European rules. On the contrary, this sector is particularly, and unfortunately too often, affected directly by external pollution: nitrates in fresh water, waste discharged from ships’ tanks, hydrocarbons, chemical products and toxic algae in seawater. Fish farmers are, then, too often the powerless victims of tragedies such as that involving the Prestige
. That is why I have focused my report on four key aspects of sustainable development: those relating to the environment, the social sphere, the economy and governance. I shall not go into any more detail on these topics, with which everyone is very familiar. Instead, I should like to emphasise one fundamental aspect of aquaculture, that of research, which should specifically enable us not only to achieve indisputable product quality for consumers, to put new products on the market and to discover innovative forms of aquaculture such as off–shore sites, but also – and why not? – to do as I have proposed and to conserve and develop wild species, particularly of fish, with a view to restocking of a kind that, in a number of cases, would enable the resource to be maintained. Is this utopian thinking? We shall see. Nor shall I go into more detail about my report which, I am very happy to say, has been unanimously adopted by the Committee on Fisheries. I prefer to take this opportunity to express once again my compassion for the fish farmers and fishermen who have been affected on such a long–term basis by the loss of the Prestige
, which shows just how vulnerable they are. They are not polluters. Rather, they are the victims of pollution. This disaster, which began by polluting the Galician coast, has also affected the French Atlantic coast, including that Mecca of oyster farming, the Arcachon basin. Behind the aquaculture sites, there are people: people who have worked ceaselessly to ensure the quality of their products and who are in danger of seeing all their efforts, indeed their very lives, reduced to nothing. In this way, the Prestige disaster has, for an unspecified period, exposed every member of the profession, including their families, to suffering that is both psychological and economic. It is intolerable that oyster farmers should once again be victims of inadequate maritime safety and of the dumping of hydrocarbons onto our coasts. In this connection, I should like to congratulate the Commission which, at the time, proposed an initial set of vital measures under the headings of the Erika 1 and Erika 2 packages, and say how sorry I am – and I am talking directly to the Presidency here – that a number of these measures have been deferred and others not taken into account. This has been due to pressure exercised by a small number of Member States that are better at depending upon payments than at devoting their attention to what is essential: the survival of the planet. What can be done in the short term? Certainly, there are already existing resources within the framework of the FIFG programmes, and a whole range of measures can be implemented. The Commissioner has replied to me on this subject. Finally, I would emphasise the importance of combating flags of convenience, as well as the need to establish a European Corps of Coastguards. Even though it would be difficult to establish such a corps in the short term, its benefits would include improving the effectiveness of border controls and strengthening maritime safety. Indeed, I remain conscious of the fact that, setting aside the Prestige
 disaster, maritime hooligans pollute our seas on a daily basis by a criminal act for which the penalties are not sufficiently severe: that of discharging waste into the sea. I urge the Greek Presidency to put maritime safety and the measures to be taken in the event of disaster at the top of its agenda. This report will be adopted in very sad circumstances. For all that, let us look steadfastly towards this sector of the future. It is important for the Commission to implement the recommendations in my report, particularly in relation to research and innovation. Consumers and the industry as a whole stand to benefit.

 Mr President, the demand for an adjournment of this debate and vote on the draft association agreement with Egypt is completely unrealistic, not to say bizarre. It shows a complete lack of understanding of the agreement and of Egypt, a great country and a friend of Europe. The draft agreement contains 92 articles concerning not only economic and social issues, but also the political dialogue which is important for achieving progress and peace. Negotiations leading up to the agreement have taken over seven years and have been conducted in difficult circumstances. Those who are calling for an adjournment have clearly not thought about the consequences, especially given the current state of world affairs. Need I remind you that, unlike certain other Arab countries, Egypt has never been a breeding ground for terrorists? On the contrary, Egypt has paid dearly for terrorism. It would be irresponsible not to adopt this agreement. It is unrealistic to expect Egypt to copy our models exactly. It is unrealistic to expect to be able to impose our law. It is unrealistic not to take account of the culture, identity and sovereignty of Egypt. The Member States and we, ourselves, must ratify this agreement. We owe it to the European Union because this agreement will be an essential factor in the necessary relaunch of the Barcelona process. We owe it also to Egypt, a great country and a friend of Europe, acknowledged for its role in working for peace in the Middle East.

 Mr President, Commissioner, I am pleased and honoured to have been appointed rapporteur for the association agreement between the European Union, the Member States and the Arab Republic of Egypt, given the importance of this agreement for both the European Union and Egypt. I believe it is a balanced agreement which treats both parties in an equitable way. The Arab Republic of Egypt is the largest Arab country in terms of population: it has over 66 million inhabitants. It occupies a pivotal position in terms of geopolitical affairs and plays a leading role. Egypt was the first Arab country to establish diplomatic relations with Israel. Since that time, it has continued to have a moderating influence in the region. Relations between the European Union and Egypt go back a long way. The first cooperation agreement was signed in 1972. We must remember that the European Union is Egypt’s most important trading partner. Egypt also receives significant funds from cooperation with the European Union: it received EUR 686 million through the MEDA I programme between 1996 and 1999. The report we are discussing today has been called a new generation report. Its fundamental objective is to help achieve peace and security in the region. It also aims to provide an impetus for the development of commercial and economic relations between Egypt and the European Union, and between Egypt and its Mediterranean partners. The draft agreement is based on respect for democratic principles and fundamental human rights. The main objectives of the agreement are as follows. Firstly, the establishment of an area of free trade between Egypt and the European Union. This will entail the abolition of customs tariffs on industrial products within a period of 12 to 15 years after the agreement enters into force. Secondly, regional cooperation, including the creation of a Euro-Mediterranean area of free trade. Thirdly, it establishes the basis for economic and financial cooperation in many areas, including the fight against terrorism. Lastly, an in-depth dialogue on social issues and cooperation as regards the prevention and control of illegal immigration. I am delighted that this proposal has received the unanimous support of the Committee on Foreign Affairs, Human Rights, Common Security and Defence Policy. This shows the interest the report has generated. It has also allowed people to express their concerns and fears; some of these are well founded, others less so. I would like to outline two of the concerns put forward. Firstly, there is the problem of the Coptic minority. Coptic Christians represent more than 10% of the population. It appears that, while they are not systematically persecuted, they do not have the same rights and responsibilities as their fellow Muslim citizens. It is also clear that extremists are to blame for some of the problems as they do everything they can to exacerbate tension between the two religious groups. However, some progress has been made, as confirmed by the Coptic religious leaders. One example is the recent construction of new monasteries and churches, despite the red tape involved. Secondly, certain individuals and groups have been brought before the courts. This has been highly publicised in Egypt and elsewhere. We need to look beyond the initial verdicts. The local court judges are sometimes influenced by fundamentalist teaching and hand down harsh sentences. But, in some instances, higher courts overturn these initial verdicts and act more leniently, in accordance with democratic principles. I am aware that a lot of work still remains to be done on the issues of fairness and justice, but clearly some progress has been made. The leaders from the opposition and from NGOs, who I have met with in the country, confirm this. The report has raised a number of more general concerns. I share some of these, but I must caution those who very willingly step forward to preach to us and to give eulogies on human rights. They should be aware of the need to put their own house in order. It is all too easy for the Egyptians to remind us of our own deficiencies, and they are right to do this. We are open to criticism for having been so lax on a number of issues, particularly as regards the fight against terrorism. We have been reminded that our Member States provide terrorists and murderers, including some Egyptians, with a safe haven where they can live and act with impunity. We must be on our guard. Many Egyptians, including some in important positions, do not wish this agreement to be ratified. They insist that the agreement strongly favours the European Union, especially as regards economic issues, and that it will allow random intrusions into the internal affairs of the State. The recent letter from the People’s Assembly on this matter is inopportune but significant. Given these circumstances, I hope that the great majority of Parliament will vote in favour of ratifying this agreement. It is to be hoped that the agreement will strengthen the role of the European Union in this region and will contribute towards achieving peace.

 Mr President, so much has now been said and written about the tragedy, the crime of 11 September. I will, therefore, confine myself to three issues: terrorism, Europe and the world. Yes, we must resolutely declare war on all forms of terrorism, from wherever it comes, the IRA, ETA, the assassins of Claude Erignac, Prefect of Corsica, Osama Bin Laden and his clique and all the others, but without making the stupid and suicidal mistake of lumping them all together. Our capacity to take in terrorists is now beyond the limit; it is probable that the insane attacks of 11 September were prepared in Europe. So, let us spring to action and pool our resources, our activities, our objectives in the field of intelligence, justice, security and defence and let us be implacable towards the terrorists, their networks, their support structures, their dirty money. Yes, the Commissioner was quite right to refer to the obligation to get results! Solidarity with our friends, our American allies, does not imply mindless alignment. With its tried and tested experience of the world, Europe can and must play a specific role here. Others place hope in us, await us, call on us, alas, too often without response. Let us not disappoint them any longer. In the Middle East, a constant source of tension, the issue has to be resolved by the establishment of two sovereign states – Israel and Palestine – with absolute security guarantees for both. Even the Americans are, for the first time, considering this obvious arrangement. It is up to us to initiate the process of opening the doors. Let us finally realise that the post-Yalta organisation of the world needs to be rethought to take account of the incredible developments since the last war: the emergence of nuclear powers, whether official or not, the fall of the Berlin wall, more than a billion Muslims around the world desperately seeking recognition and respect, new giants like India, limitless technological developments in every field, developments that are accessible only to the few, the ever-widening gap between rich and poor. Let us finally take account of these positive or disturbing trends and organise a world in which each individual is recognised, respected rather than despised, involved rather than ignored. There is a burning need to fulfil that obligation.

 Mr President, I have to say that I was slightly surprised that Mr Coelho, who did an excellent job in inspiring difficult debates and maintained a completely objective approach, was given so little speaking time. I would also like to thank Mr Schmid who has obviously worked very hard on this issue, even though I disagree with some of the points in his report. The resolution poses a fundamental problem. It highlights that the Echelon system exists and was set up by the United States with the help of the United Kingdom, in particular. On the other hand, the resolution raises the problem of whether the participation of an EU Member State in the Echelon system is compatible with European law. This is a genuine problem in cases where Echelon is used to carry out commercial or industrial espionage and to quote from paragraph F of the resolution “if the system is misused for the purposes of gathering competitive intelligence, such action is at odds with the Member States’ duty of loyalty and with the concept of a common market based on free competition, so that a Member State participating in such a system violates EC law.” In my view, this point is fundamental and that is why this report, in spite of its values, leaves me with mixed feelings. In particular, I do not accept the way the use of the territory of a Member State by a third party state – whether or not an ally – is trivialised with the argument that another Member State, France, in this case, could have the resources to set up its own global interception system. This is not the same situation at all and that was not part of the work of the Echelon Committee. Today, economic conflicts can be very serious and industrial espionage is only an instrument and, therefore, we should perhaps take care to ensure that we do not use this sort of war-mongering vocabulary to refer to our allies, and, even more so, to the EU Member States. We in Parliament have a right to expect the Member State or States involved, the Council and the Commission to take preventative measures and action.

 Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, as rapporteur for the Association Agreement between the European Union and the Arabic Republic of Egypt, I would like to remind you of the importance of this agreement for the construction of a total partnership, which is not only commercial but also political and cultural, with this key player in the Middle East. Nobody would be mistaken for thinking that this is an agreement of the heart with this friendly country. Given that negotiations were concluded in June 1999, the Association Agreement is due to be signed very soon and we will be asked to take a stand on this text. I hope it will mark the start of a new momentum in our relations with Egypt and the strengthening of our exchanges and our mutual understanding, as this is one of the crucial objectives of this Association Agreement. It seems to me that we must not impose our own models and concepts and condemn certain attitudes out of hand. We must instead analyse, understand and support without, for all that, tolerating the unacceptable. This, to my mind, is the justification for this compromise resolution and I would like to thank those of my colleagues who helped to draft and support it, especially Mr Purvis and Mr Dary. The aim of this resolution is to demonstrate the unfailing vigilance of my group and of this Parliament regarding respect for human rights around the world and especially in relation to our Mediterranean partners. We owe it to ourselves to remain intransigent on these issues whilst at the same time encouraging those who take the correct path. Mutual understanding is crucial and that is one of the messages I would like to get across today. Urgent or topical resolutions must not make us forget this. On the contrary, they must become the instrument of choice in our mutual understanding. Having raised this issue on numerous occasions with the Egyptian authorities, I know that they understand this and are willing to comply. That is what is important. (Applause)

 Mr President, I think that our debate on the transatlantic dialogue has come at a very good moment. I need not remind Members how crucial this dialogue is with a view to achieving cooperation between equal partners, between the United States of America and the European Union. The dialogue allows us to deal with our differences and to settle some of our old trade disputes; here I am thinking in particular of bananas, an issue we finally resolved a few weeks ago. I want to emphasise the importance of the question of European defence, an issue I regard as extremely important, in particular now that we are dealing with a new American Administration that has already openly advertised its defence projects. It is quite clear that President Bush's Administration is far more distrustful of the ESDP than President Clinton's was, but that does not surprise me. It took the Union several years to explain its objectives, define its means and convince its American ally that a European defence system could be developed alongside NATO. Today we must at all costs protect this achievement of the transatlantic dialogue. The concept of an ally must not be a one-way road. I believe that the Union has shown itself to be entirely transparent in the way it has presented the CESP, followed by the ESDP, to the United States and I think it should make it just as clear that the United States must consult its allies on all major projects, of which the anti-missile shield project is one. Regarding European defence policy as such, we must continue to state firmly what we want, as we always have done, and not systematically look at every European defence question in terms of NATO's reaction. The Union has always emphasised the importance of complementarity between European action and Alliance action, especially in relation to the Petersberg tasks. The issue here is neither competition nor disengagement, but simply a united approach.

 Mr President, we all stressed, both today and yesterday, the importance that we attach to Mediterranean policy and to the need to urgently reinvigorate the Barcelona Process, which is all too often disregarded. The past year has not lived up to these expectations. Admittedly, it was possible to hold another Euro-Mediterranean conference during the French Presidency, but this meeting produced few decisions and, above all, no genuine strategy. Furthermore, I believe that it is time to give our Mediterranean strategy a firm foundation and to dissociate it from the vicissitudes of the Israeli-Palestinian conflict. I sincerely hope that the European Union will achieve its goal of strengthening economic, political and cultural ties with the countries of the Mediterranean Basin. We shall soon be discussing the partnership agreement between the European Union and Egypt. I am delighted that this agreement was finally signed last week. As the rapporteur on Egypt, I sincerely hope that we can take this opportunity to encourage the other partners who have not yet signed up to an agreement to do so as soon as possible. It is also worth considering the European Parliament’s role in this process, which is still too limited. Then perhaps we might be able to shape the Euro-Mediterranean Parliamentary Forum on the model of the ACP-EU Joint Assembly, which meets twice yearly and can set up working parties and initiate fact-finding missions. We could also, perhaps, improve the organisation of Parliament’s regular participation in ministerial meetings between the Barcelona Process members. To sum up, Mr President, I would like to ask the Council and the Commission to explicitly recognise the role of towns and large cities, and I should like to thank Mr Naïr, the rapporteur, for agreeing to table an amendment that I made to his excellent report. The Mediterranean countries should be encouraged to develop their relations and to share their experiences on specific urban issues. The problems of modern times are most serious within towns and large cities.

 Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, today’s debate enables us to stand back a little from the events in Tunisia of the last few weeks, and gain some perspective, particularly with regard to what has become known as the Ben Brik affair. There has been particularly widespread coverage of these events in the media, and this has, let there be no doubt about it, enabled pressure to be put on the Tunisian authorities to remedy the situation as quickly and as humanely as possible. The huge media coverage of the affair, however, has also led to some people assuming that it reflects the situation in Tunisia as a whole, which runs quite counter to the facts and the reality with which we are familiar.  As my friend and colleague, Mr Hernández Mollar, pointed out, the EPP hopes that, today, we will be able to give a message of hope and support to all Tunisians who are committed to their country pursuing the path of political as well as economic reform. The European Parliament has a duty to act fairly and straightforwardly with all the Mediterranean countries that are part of the Barcelona Process. We are sometimes criticised – particularly in Tunisia – for treating some countries more harshly than others, and on this issue, I should like to point out that the principles and the values contained in the Barcelona Declaration, and reiterated in every partnership agreement with a Mediterranean country, are the same for all countries, including Member States of the Union. Tunisia is not being treated differently in any way. This message of hope is founded, in part, upon the economic and social achievements that we have seen Tunisia make. We must, however, also respect our commitments and our convictions, and I think that we would be doing Tunisians a favour by convincing them that our Parliament will always pay close attention to developments in the political situation and in civil society in their country, regardless of the good economic results that may have been achieved. We must also persuade all of our Mediterranean partners that the commitments which they have given through taking part in the Barcelona process, specifically in the field of democracy and human rights, are not negotiable.   Finally, then, I would urge all Members to staunchly support the motion for a resolution that we have tabled today, which, I think, provides a balanced picture of Parliament’s views on the situation in Tunisia. I have no doubt that this message will be received in the appropriate way by the Tunisian authorities, who will step up and continue the initial measures that they have already adopted.

 Presidents all, Commissioner, on the occasion of this debate I should like to highlight the importance and the impact of the Pope’s visit to the Holy Land. Whatever our beliefs or religious convictions, we are forced to acknowledge that John Paul II’s message is a major contribution to progress towards peace in the region. In an area where pitfalls abound, in a context where every word and every gesture is weighed to assay its symbolic meaning, in Jordan, Israel and the Palestinian territories the Supreme Pontiff has found the right way to discuss persistent problems between the communities. The Holy Father shows us that the religious aspect of the conflicts cannot be disregarded, and that dialogue between religions is just as much a factor in stability as political dialogue. This visit has been an exceptional demonstration of the understanding that can be achieved between all parties. My feeling, on the occasion of this debate, is that it is worth paying tribute to the actions of this great man of peace, this indefatigable pilgrim. I should also like to ask two questions of the Council and the Commission, the first on regional cooperation between the countries of the southern shore of the Mediterranean, and the second on the role of the European Parliament in the Barcelona Process. Firstly, with regard to regional cooperation – and the presidency has just answered this in part – the Union bases its Mediterranean policy on the Barcelona Process. This approach is supposed to be global and regional and treats the Mediterranean Basin as a regional entity. It is reasonable to think that cooperation between the Mediterranean States should be much stronger. The second question concerns the role of the European Parliament, and it must be noted that, at present, it is too limited. So, as I pointed out, the Union’s Mediterranean policy is supposed to be global. The European Parliament is, in fact, only consulted on the occasion of bilateral agreements. It would be necessary either to reconcile the European Parliament with the Forum, along the lines of the ACP-EU Joint Assembly, or to organise the more active and regular participation of the European Parliament in ministerial meetings.

 I should like to ask the Commissioner to clarify his answer. Obviously such aid is already officially provided for in the countries of the Community. Instead, the question concerns countries outside the territory of the Community, and may be expressed thus: will we, or will we not, have the possibility of obtaining a derogation in terms of the tonnage, costs or time limits with regard to wood exports, in consideration of the quite exceptional nature of this storm? My question clearly concerned exports outside the common market, outside the Union.

 – Madam President, the presentation by President Prodi today has necessarily been a fairly broad brush affair. We will be looking for the detail year by year, for example in the social action programme to be unveiled this year. We will also be looking at this from the perspective of social and employment policy, and will be applying a number of tests. We will be looking at the extent to which we can create an equilateral policy triangle combining economic policy, employment policy and social policy. At the moment, social policy is trailing well behind economic and employment policy. Within the employment strategy we will look for a deepening and broadening of the strategy following the review under the Portuguese presidency and within the framework being proposed by the Portuguese Presidency. Within the social dimension we will be looking for a deepening of the internal market with a social aspect. The spate of mergers, takeovers and transfers that we are experiencing with the deepening of the market means that we must act to update the matrix of information and consultation directives that we have adopted in the past; but we must also complement them with the new general framework of information and consultation and an updating of the works council directive. We also need a code of corporate conduct to make sure that companies in fact work in partnership with their workers in the management of change. That is the successful way to manage change, and I hope the Commission will act to make sure that is put into place. Finally, with the emergence, the resurgence, of the xenophobic Right within the European Union I hope that our institutions together will do their utmost to give reality to Article 6 by using Article 13 to combat discrimination, and Article 137 to combat exclusion. We need to move that agenda forward with great urgency now. The aspirations are fine, President Prodi, we want those aspirations to be matched by action.

 Mr President, you have before you a joint motion for a resolution on the recent acts of violence perpetrated in Upper Egypt, in which more than 20 Egyptian citizens were killed. You may know that I am also the rapporteur on the association agreement between the European Union and Egypt. The negotiations on the technical files were completed last June and we should very soon be dealing with the finalised text. This agreement will, I hope, mark the advent of ever closer relations between Egypt, which is an essential force in the Middle East and the Mediterranean area, and the Union. The political situation has now reached a favourable point in the Middle East and I should like to stress this fact in order to place our action in the wider context. Through this resolution, the Parliament seeks to express its feelings about the events that have occurred but also to point out that it will be very vigilant with regard to the matter of human rights in the context of negotiations with our Mediterranean partners, as we are with all our partners. Our action has focused on protecting human rights and democracy, and I believe it is essential to show that we shall continue to take a hard line on these matters and encourage those who take steps in the right direction. It has not escaped the attention of this House that the Egyptian authorities reacted quickly, quite rightly, in order to undertake an on-the-spot enquiry and especially to organise aid for the victims of this violence. President Mubarak himself intervened at the height of the crisis. It is therefore quite clear, in my view, that this resolution should be considered as a positive sign and as encouragement on our part and I would ask all my colleagues to approve this text which is the result of a compromise. In this vein, I should like to thank those members who jointly signed this motion for the goodwill they showed in order to arrive at a joint text. I should like to conclude, Mr President, by saying that it is true that this text has evolved, what is more, in association with the Egyptian authorities, which is a very good omen.

 Mr President, the last days of 1999 were swept away by an incredibly violent storm, which struck France in the main, but also affected Germany, Spain, Great Britain and Switzerland. I am sad to say that it accounted for more than 100 deaths, 88 of which occurred in France. The human cost has been enormous, but so has the material damage, and both public amenities and private property have been destroyed or seriously damaged. Millions of homes are without electricity, telephones or running water. Economic activities have been brought to a halt. In France alone, insurance companies are already estimating the costs of the damages at a total of FF 35-40 billion, which is between EUR 5 and 6 billion.  This unprecedented natural disaster has called all available forces to action and has given rise to demonstrations of solidarity both within the Community’s borders and beyond. This is why I would like to thank all of those who gave a hand to the emergency services, and to the authorities and public services which were overwhelmed by the magnitude of the task. Thank you, everyone, from the bottom of my heart, for this invaluable help.   Now that the shock has passed and the authorities’ vital functions have been re-established, I wonder, and I ask the Commission and the Council to consider as well the opportunity once again to incorporate a budget line for emergency aid into the Community budget, in order to address this kind of occurrence. The risks of weather-related disasters must not be ignored and, in the light of the consequences of such disasters and the speed of intervention that they require, I think that the Community would do well to have these resources again. It should be possible to release the emergency aid that we once had from the strict rules applied to the Structural Funds.   I also agree with Commissioner Barnier’s proposal to gradually set in place a European civil protection force – a proposal he put forward several months ago now – which we discussed, Commissioner, at the time of the earthquakes. It is obvious that the answer to the question I am asking about re-establishing Community emergency aid must be “yes”.   Next, I would like to address the huge problems encountered by one industry that has been particularly badly affected by this storm. I am talking about the forestry sector, whose business has been seriously damaged by the havoc that the terrible weather wrought on the forests. It must be understood that forests are not just landscape or environmental features. They also represent a major socio-economic sector in some regions, and this should not be overlooked.   In France, more than 120 million cubic metres of wood were brought down by the wind. This represents around three years' full harvest for producers. The consequences of this have been immediate. Some foresters have lost everything. Entire areas of forest have been devastated, which will, in a few weeks, cause security and fire-fighting problems. Prices have already fallen because of the huge availability of timber, which has led to market saturation. Infrastructures will suffer as a result of the abnormal volume of heavy goods vehicles, logging and handling gear on the roads.   In these circumstances, it is crucial that we re-establish access routes, restore the land, and implement technical solutions, which will enable us to refit storage areas, and prop up timber prices. In the long term we will have to reforest, with all the resources we can muster. This is a whole raft of measures which should be adopted, Mr President, and I am delighted at the indications which the Commissioner gave, even though he knows that not everything is eligible under Objective 2. Médoc is not, Commissioner, and I hope that, given the circumstances, the EAGGF will be able to replace Objective 2.

 Mr President, Commissioner Fischler, ladies and gentlemen, first of all I would like to say that I will limit myself to a general issue since we have rapporteurs for each product who will, therefore, each elaborate on a particular issue. The Committee on Agriculture and Rural Development reached a compromise agreement on 19 February 2004 within the framework of the project on the reform of the common agricultural policy for tobacco, olive oil, cotton and hops. We are not losing sight of the fact that this is about adopting a single European Commission regulation, which will amend the principle of the single payment scheme. A global agreement needs to be reached and not independent agreements for each sector. The whole of the negotiation process is interdependent. The Commission and the Council have the ambitious goal of reaching an overall agreement very quickly. As Commissioner Fischler said, we must not have a legal vacuum, especially in the tobacco sector. The Committee on Agriculture and Rural Development considered that the principle of decoupling aid, as proposed by the Commission, can only apply if several external elements are also taken into consideration, particularly the fluctuation and development of international agricultural prices as well as the very marked contrast between internal and external prices. The agricultural policy for Mediterranean products must move towards supporting the work of small farmers and family farming and protecting the number of jobs – hundreds of thousands of them – in rural areas. Any plan for reform must present all the possible alternatives to guarantee the future for farmers and affected regions, and must take into account the social importance as well as the different production situations in the Member States. The members of this Parliament’s Committee on Agriculture and Rural Development have shown their preference for a greater appropriation of agricultural funds for the market aimed at measures for rural development in order to improve, in particular, the environment and quality production. Assuming that a significant number of farmers decide to cease production and receive subsidies, the fact of granting agricultural aid independent of production should not in any case increase territorial problems and create an imbalance between different sectors. On the contrary, the principle of partial decoupling should allow for more equal remuneration for all farmers and for all production by applying the principle of multifunctionality. Partial decoupling at a production level is to allow for evolution rather than revolution in our Mediterranean regions. The European agricultural model must be supported. Europe needs its farmers and needs to support the population in its rural areas. We must protect the interests of our farmers at World Trade Organisation level. As recent budgets for the United States show, US agriculture will once again benefit from a substantial increase. Follow their example, Commissioner! I would add that this substantial increase is expected. We know that your work in the Commission is not easy, but we know your common sense and your pragmatic nature, so we ask you to agree to the compromise proposal, which is a good one, put to you in the Committee on Agriculture and Rural Development.

 Mr President, Mr President of the Commission, Commissioners, ladies and gentlemen, I turn to you, Mr President, in your capacity as chairman of the Conference of Presidents. As you know, the parliamentary committees have been fully involved in preparing the legislative and work programme that Mr Prodi has just presented. It is thanks to this interinstitutional dialogue that today we have a programme for 2004 that largely reflects the shared priorities of our institutions. Nevertheless, there is certainly still room for improvement. Although the Commission has not taken account of all the requests made by the parliamentary committees, experience shows that the reliability of the timetables could be further improved. By way of an example, seventeen of the twenty-two proposals for codecision in the 2004 programme have already appeared in previous annual programmes and ought therefore to have been tabled long ago. It is therefore essential for both parties to monitor this programme carefully. In this context I would remind you that last year Parliament put forward the idea of having policy papers for each legislative area. These would form the basis for more detailed programming and would also be entirely in keeping with the objectives of the interinstitutional agreement on ‘Better Law-Making’, which requires the three institutions to both better coordinate and better synchronise their legislative work. I would stress the three institutions because the Council is not currently involved in the structured dialogue. At the next Brussels meeting of the European Council, the Council’s first multiannual programme will be presented. It would be helpful if the European Parliament could be informed of the programme in good time precisely so as to establish a constructive dialogue between the three institutions concerned. I will also take the liberty of drawing your attention to the need to agree a procedure for an ad hoc
 dialogue with the Commission for the year 2004. We will be addressing this issue this afternoon in the Conference of Presidents. But in my opinion it is essential that every effort be made to ensure that all of the stakeholders, including national parliaments and advisory bodies and, at the end of the day, the European public, have a legislative programme for the year 2005 in good time. If it is true that the current Commission really will be able to present its political strategy and budget for 2005 to the Union before October of next year then it should also be able to present its legislative programme during the course of that same month of October. Last year, I said here that I was convinced that, thanks to the structured dialogue, we were seeing the establishment of a genuine culture of planning and interinstitutional programming. The experiences of these last few months and the prospects for the future are in line with the interinstitutional agreement on ‘Better Law-Making’ and fully confirm my optimism. It is up to all of us to work on this together in the interests of our fellow citizens.

Madam President, Commissioners, honourable Members, I had prepared a speech, but everything has been said. I shall start, Commissioners, Mr Lamy, by saying that, when there is a failure, someone is to blame. I think that we are all to blame. When we say we have to divide up the shirt and we do so badly, it is perhaps because we were ill-prepared. But we also have to confine ourselves to our responsibilities. I agree with what Mr van Velzen and Mr Suominen said. First, I should like, nonetheless, to tell you that I am very happy with the agreement concluded before Cancún on generic medicines, even if it is a minor agreement for the developing countries. I have a particular thought for this issue. Secondly, having been present in Seattle and Doha, I shall say that it is true that negotiations can no longer continue to take place under such conditions. Mr Lamy, you are right to say and, if it is true that you should leave as certain people have said, it is now time to say how negotiations should be conducted. It is also true that we cannot, on the one hand, have demonstrations and, on the other hand, have people who want to negotiate and try to find solutions, especially for the poorest countries, within the framework of multilateral negotiations. This multilateralism is important, but it is absolutely necessary to introduce more democracy into the World Trade Organisation (WTO). This is an important point: in Cancún, I noted a lack of democracy at the level of the negotiating table and at the level of the general climate. I even think that this is what worried me most at the end of my third participation in the negotiations. We are being asked for transparency and clarification. All those participating in the negotiations must be transparent about why they are there and whom they are representing. The 25 Member States of the Community were represented by two people. The Group of 21 was defended by certain NGOs which we had met in our offices in Brussels, and which had used a very different language then from the language they used in Cancún. All that is true. The boil perhaps needed to burst, but, above all, we must not leave. Who is to blame, then, and who is not? Above all, we must ask ourselves two additional questions, Mr Lamy. What are we going to do next, how are we going to work, how are we going to apply the ‘peace clause’ at the level of our work in the immediate future? That is the question European farmers are asking themselves.

Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, today, you are called upon to give your opinion on the various draft reports on the mid-term review of the common agricultural policy. I will not talk about the substance but, as Chairman of the Committee on Agriculture and Rural Development, I cannot ignore the comments, not to say the criticisms, some of you will be tempted to make as regards the procedure chosen for the adoption of these various reports. Unfortunately, we were pressed for time and I am the first to regret this. The goal of the Council presidency was to have Parliament’s opinion by the end of June. The time we were allotted was very short. However, we have chosen to respond to this request so that it cannot be said that the principle of consulting the European Parliament merely causes delays in the discussions underway. In fact, at a time when the debate on the development of the European institutions is considering precisely the competence of our House, any delay in the consultation procedure could have been interpreted as a sign that Members were incapable of dealing with an issue head-on and giving their opinion within the allotted timeframes. That is why, in the Committee on Agriculture, we adopted a procedure that made it possible to respect both the timetable set for us by the Council presidency, which is keen to move this issue forward, and the right of expression and of amendment of the members of the Committee on Agriculture. We achieved this as a result of the remarkable work of the committee staff, and also the coordinators.  I felt it was necessary, Mr President, to explain why we adopted a working method dictated by the urgency of the situation and increased the pace of the work, whilst respecting our fellow Members’ right of expression. As far as I am concerned, it is the result of a compromise achieved through the desire of the members of the Committee on Agriculture to preserve the key provisions on the management of agricultural markets laid down by the common agricultural policy, whilst allowing us to move towards a form of agriculture that gives greater consideration to the general interest. Mr President-in-Office of the Council, you must now take the right decisions to guarantee a decent income and a future for our farming families.

 Mr President of the Commission, Mr President-in-Office of the Council, Commissioner, Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, the presentation of the Commission’s legislative and work programme for the year 2003 constitutes an important stage in working relations between our two institutions. In fact, the presentation of this programme today marks the end of an interinstitutional schedule of financial payments agreed between our two institutions in January 2002. As this is the first exercise of its kind, it will clearly be possible to improve a number of points next time and I shall take the liberty of coming back to this matter at the end of my speech. In February 2002, the Commission presented to Parliament the annual political strategy for the year 2003. On the basis of this document, a true interinstitutional dialogue took place, from April to July, between the parliamentary committees and Commissioners concerned, on the scope and implementation of political priorities in each specific field of competence. In July, within the Conference of Committee chairmen, jointly with the Vice-President of the Commission, Mrs de Palacio, we carried out an assessment of this year’s programme. Then, in September, the Conference of Committee chairmen, also in the presence of Mrs de Palacio, drew up an inventory of the various legislative proposals that the Commission intended to introduce in its legislative and work programme for next year. The document that Mr Prodi has just presented is therefore, to a great extent, the outcome of the dialogue which has taken place throughout the year. Now, in order to conclude this process, Parliament is due to decide on a motion for a resolution on 5 December. In this regard, I would inform you that the parliamentary committees decided, at the meeting which took place the day before yesterday, to prepare, each in their own field of competence, a contribution which can be included in this motion for a resolution. Mr President, allow me to inform the European Commission, as well as Parliament, of my positive assessment of the interinstitutional schedule of financial payments which has been established for the first time. More or less one year ago, the Commission position, as you will all recall, was practically the opposite. The establishment of this schedule of financial payments required a great deal of effort, in particular by Parliament. In this regard, I would like to highlight the remarkable work of our colleague Mrs Malmström, during negotiations with the Commission. In fact, it was possible to establish the schedule of financial payments due to the mutual trust that has been created between our two institutions with regard to legislative programming. Naturally, on the basis of this year’s experience, the various stages will be better understood and can be implemented next year. A true culture of planning and interinstitutional programming is currently developing between the European institutions, which is surely moving in the direction expected by our citizens. In this regard, allow me to conclude my speech by recalling that at the time of the Seville Summit of 21 and 22 July this year, the European Council decided that the Council would establish a work programme. I therefore hope that the resolution upon which Parliament is to vote on 5 December will also address the Council with a view to establishing its programme for the year. I would like to end by emphasising the importance of dialogue with the Council. I would like to thank Mr Haarder in particular, who has always been there when we needed him. I believe it is worth emphasising, Mr Haarder, because it is good to hear congratulations, too, from time to time. Efficient legislative programming effectively means two things. First of all, transparency in terms of knowledge and citizens’ access to the legislative work that the European Union intends to undertake in the year ahead. Secondly, greater efficiency in carrying out legislative work, not forgetting that, thanks to better programming, Parliament, the Council and the Commission can inform the national parliaments and the citizens on legislative work and take full responsibility for it. (Applause)

 Mr President, President-in-Office of the Council, Commissioner, I am pleased to present to you today the motion for a resolution on a mid-term review adopted by the Committee on Agriculture and Rural Development on 21 October. Without wishing to give a complete history of the various stages of the common agricultural policy and subsequent reviews carried out by the European Union, allow me nevertheless to remind you that the European Council, at the Berlin Summit, set out the applicable guidelines for the period 1999-2006. It also introduced amendments with regard to certain common organisations of the market, in particular the cereal, beef and milk COMs. I would remind you that the European Council asked the Commission to present a report in 2002 on changes in agricultural spending, accompanied, where necessary, by the appropriate proposals. It is within this context that the European Commission sent a proposal for a reform of the common agricultural policy to Parliament and the Council, which was presented by Commissioner Fischler on 10 July this year. Discussions within the Committee on Agriculture and Rural Development therefore took place within this context, resulting in the drafting of the resolution I have the honour of presenting to you today. The debate was extremely comprehensive. As we can see from the 388 amendments tabled by the members of the committee, the compromise we were able to achieve required a great deal of effort from all concerned, whatever their political leanings or the national interests they represent. The vote, which was won by a substantial majority, shows, if this were necessary, its members’ concern to go beyond political and national divisions in order to present comments capable of influencing the debates. The objective of this resolution is threefold. First and foremost, its aim is to reiterate the fundamental principles of the common agricultural policy, in particular financial solidarity, the need for a fair income for producers and the maintenance of border protection in order to prevent distortions of competition. Its second aim is to define the broad guidelines for its implementation by paying more attention to the concerns expressed by European citizens with regard to the environment, health protection, food quality, rural development and animal welfare, while responding to farmers’ demands concerning remuneration for their work and the simplification of the agricultural policy’s administration, to encourage young farmers to work in the sector. Its third and final aim is to frame the CAP review in a long-term perspective in order to make market management mechanisms more comprehensible for farmers, and more generally for the agri-food sector, and enable them to make long-term investments. That is why the Committee on Agriculture and Rural Development feels that, without calling into question the powers of the other committees concerned, any adaptation of the CAP must take place within a long-term budgetary perspective which must, in any case, go beyond 2006, the year in which new guidelines will have to be negotiated. The Council now also shares this concern. The fact that the Committee on Agriculture and Rural Development and the Council take the same view shows how important it is to maintain a strong common agricultural policy which is seen by all our citizens to be implemented equitably, and which we now need to endorse. With regard to the resolution proposed, I shall first consider market management aid. The European Commission’s approach, designed to decouple direct aid to producers, simplifies the management of this aid, but will also lead to the eventual dismantling of any market management measures. That is why the Committee on Agriculture and Rural Development suggests partial decoupling. Furthermore, this step should not cause production prices to fall. Lastly, the suggested proposals to lower intervention prices do not appear necessary in the current context. Establishing partial decoupling in the work of the committee would allow producers to receive a fixed sum of basic aid per farm or per hectare, calculated on past figures but restricted to a maximum figure of EUR 10 000. The second element of the resolution is the reinforcement of the second pillar, in order to support certain policies relating to rural development. The resolution emphasises flexibility, which is crucial to implementing rural development policies, and which allows account to be taken of the concerns expressed at regional level. The third guideline concerns the need for strict compliance by producers who receive Community aid, under both the first and the second pillar, with the principles laid down by European directives in the field of environmental protection and animal welfare. Lastly, the Committee on Agriculture and Rural Development wanted, by means of its resolution, to strengthen the position of the European Union in future negotiations, by taking account of the dynamics of enlargement, by emphasising in particular the need for coherence between proposals for a mid-term review and agricultural supply to the candidate countries, in order to allow for better integration of these countries, while highlighting the margins for manoeuvre provided by WTO negotiations. The Commissioner reminded us of all this within the Committee on Agriculture at our meeting of 5 October and the European Commission should soon submit legislative measures which will have to comply with all of these restrictions. Our role is to study them and listen to the Commission when it proposes them, and we shall assume our responsibilities in Parliament. That is why I would ask the House to adopt the resolution tomorrow.

 Madam President, Mr Lamy, Mr Fischler, I should like to say, first of all, that I am delighted by the success of the Doha ministerial conference, not only from the point of view of its results, but also from a material point of view. It took place in excellent conditions, despite all the fears that we may have had. Holding this event in Qatar was in itself a response to the war against terrorism that we entered into following the tragic events of 11 September. Like other Members who took part in that conference, I appreciated the constant transparency that prevailed between the Council, the Commission and Parliament during the negotiations. That transparency was also the order of the day among the NGOs present at Doha, who are to be congratulated on the efforts that they have made in this direction since the previous conference in Seattle. We all hoped that this conference would lead to a substantial agreement that would pave the way for growth to be stimulated, thereby contributing towards economic development at a time when the international community is going through a very difficult situation. This ministerial conference certainly enabled considerable progress to be made on various fronts, including the inclusion of China and Taiwan. Another positive result, as has already been mentioned, was in connection with medicines. As for the rest, the Commission took a tough stance in the negotiations, and the efforts that it made during the final night and on the morning of 14 November enabled the European Union to convince its partners that its positions were well-founded. However, the work programme is still lagging behind the ambitions that we had set ourselves on certain major issues, such as the environment, the Singapore agenda and social standards. For my part, I should like to make three comments. During the conference, the developing countries often adopted a highly critical attitude towards the European Union. When we were preparing for this ministerial conference, did we listen carefully enough to their concerns? Let us show humility, let us take up our pilgrim’s staff again, let us listen to them and try to understand them, so that we can take their real concerns into consideration, and above all let us stop taking their place in defining the development policy that they need. Secondly, the Doha ministerial declaration constitutes an undertaking to start negotiations on the priority issues of European enlargement and integration. Finally, now that the real negotiations are about to start, I hope that the transparency that has prevailed so far will continue to do so, and that it will be strengthened still further between us. I have just one question to ask the Commissioner. What will be the general structure of the negotiations which will be defined?

 Mr President, so that I do not repeat the words of the previous speakers, I shall state that I agree with almost everything that has been said, and with Mr Böge in particular. I would, however, like to ask Mr Byrne, firstly, to clarify the regional approach that he has taken, because I believe that we must protect this and immediately put it into place. Secondly, with regard to the outcome of the inquiries, I would like to say to the Commissioner and the Council that foot-and-mouth disease is one of the contagious diseases that is rife in the world; the entire population, one which is increasingly mobile  which is natural since travel is becoming cheaper and cheaper  will, increasingly, spread diseases that can be caught by both animals and humans. That is what this crisis of foot-and-mouth disease signifies. Are you prepared, Commissioner to give some thought, in conjunction with the World Health Organisation, to all these illnesses that we are going to suffer in the future as a result of this increasingly accessible Europe, in the light of the decisions taken regarding LDCs for 2006 and 2009, which will allow the free movement of all products, apart from weapons, throughout Europe. Are you prepared, Commissioner, to take steps, as the United States has done  and I shall for once not make any openly anti-American remarks  to establish much tighter controls in our airports, on all products that arrive from anywhere and everywhere in the world. Have you considered, in conjunction with the Council and Commission, any further steps to benefit the people who travel and who pass through our airports too? This really is a genuine appeal that I am making to the Commission, to Parliament and to the national governments. I shall sum up, Commissioner, by also saying that the European spirit which brings us here, to Parliament, forces us to ask the Council and Parliament to take exceptional measures for farmers and all sectors of the economy and the affected regions in Europe, otherwise, I believe that European integration is meaningless.

rapporteur

 Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, today Parliament has to decide on the proposal for a Council regulation on the common organisation of the markets in the sugar sector. In its explanatory statement, the Commission stresses that the COM has satisfactorily fulfilled many of its objectives and legitimately proposes that the status quo with regard to prices be maintained, but only for two years and with adjustments contradicting the assessment initially made by the Commission. It, moreover, proposes to carry out a series of particularly delicate and complex studies in record time to provide a basis for a proposal for fundamental reform in two years’ time. The Council was not wrong-footed by this approach and opted to renew this COM for a further five-year period. This draft comes before us at a time when the agricultural industry is experiencing one of the worst crises with which it has ever had to deal. Is that, however, sufficient reason to reform a COM which, even in the estimation of the Commission, has fulfilled its objectives? I do not think so. That is why I think it reasonable to allow this COM to continue to operate on the present basis for a period of five years. This is the proposal I put to you today as your rapporteur. My first observation is this: from a great many of the various parties I contacted in preparing my report I heard fairly constant criticism of the excessive Community price for sugar. To clarify the reasons for this situation, I think I ought to point out that the common organisation of the markets in the sugar sector is atypical in more ways than one. This organisation of the markets is actually based on a production quotas system. This entails strict supervision of the volumes produced. In addition to this self-regulation between production, importing and exporting, the producers must bear the bulk of the expenditure incurred due to this COM. The EU budget handles only the financing of the sugar exports corresponding to the preferential imports granted to developing countries which are beneficiaries of the sugar protocol annexed to the Cotonou Agreement. Consequently, the burden of this COM is particularly light as far as European Union finances are concerned in relation to the importance of the sugar beet sector. It is true that the corollary of this situation is a specific internal price. Throughout the debates leading up to this report, there were many participants who took the opportunity to highlight the artificial nature of the Community price in relation to the world price. This criticism which has been widely expressed in various reports and media also needs some clarification. Firstly, we have to put into context any reference to a world price, since it cannot be seen as representative of the transactions actually carried out. Secondly, the objectivity which the European Parliament must display in this matter leads me to point out that, in real terms, the Community price has been in a steady decline for around fifteen years. Moreover, 75% of sugar is consumed in the form of processed products. The price of these sugar products fluctuates quite independently of the price of sugar. I should note, moreover, that such products are no more expensive in the European Union than they are in other countries. My second observation is that several studies refer to the lack of competition within the European Union in the sugar sector. Competition is specifically one of the points warranting in-depth study on the part of the Commission services within the next two years. For the time being, there is one observation that must be made. There is healthy competition between sugar manufacturers because intra-Community trade is more significant than the Commission indicates, accounting for over 30% of sugar consumption, as such, and 26% in the form of processed products. Finally, to my last observation regarding the effects upon the Community market and the ACP countries of the decision adopted 15 days ago by the Council on the initiative for the Least Developed Countries. We have just discussed this, and this initiative too is in keeping with the European Union’s commitment to launching the round of multilateral talks, a matter on which Parliament is to deliver its opinion tomorrow. Basically, I think that, for the ACP countries, this initiative will have significant implications, which have not been assessed clearly by the Commission. That is why both the studies which the Commission wishes to undertake in the context of a reform of the COM in sugar and the assessment it is to undertake in 2005 of the transitional phase of the LDC initiative are of fundamental importance. It must take account of the concerns of the ACP countries, which traditionally export their produce to the European Union. Ladies and gentlemen, I wished, in the five minutes available, to share these observations which I thought important, before you declared your opinion on the matter tomorrow. To sum up, I should like to thank the Commissioner for his contribution, and I hope that this evening he will be able to expand a little upon his point of view of Parliament’s draft text. I would like to thank all the officials in Parliament’s secretarial service for the invaluable help they have given me in drawing up this report, as well as all the fellow Members who took a very active part in this draft.

 We voted in favour of this joint resolution. We are in a crisis situation, but we are not facing just a beef crisis. In fact, we are up against a real public health problem and an economic crisis. It concerns all the stages from ‘farm to table’. The consumers have lost confidence, and to contain the situation it was essential for us to reiterate our call for the rapid introduction of compulsory tests to identify BSE for all bovine animals. This measure had to go hand in hand with an immediate ban on the use of meat-and-bone meal for all species, throughout the Community. That is certainly a practical way of applying the precautionary principle. We have been waiting for far too long. The Union as a whole must be involved, for it is unacceptable to have one country taking draconian measures and putting its economy at risk while others carry on business as usual. Moreover, we are still, unfortunately, seeing many cases of fraud and the only way to put a stop to that is to ban meat-and-bone meal throughout the Community. These are the kind of measures that will reassure the citizens and that will send the farmers the message of solidarity we want to convey to them. The European Parliament must exert pressure on the Commission, which was overly cautious in the proposals it made during the debate. We are astounded that the Commission does not seem to realise the scale of the problem. Finally, this unprecedented crisis emphasises the limitations of the common agricultural policy, which we have seen for many years now. Today we must help farmers not to increase their production, but to improve it. There too, we have been waiting for far too long. Some people are concerned about the emergence of genetically modified products to replace meat-and-bone meal. A radical change of course in the CAP, which has now become vital, towards growing vegetable crops on fields hitherto left fallow could prevent people from resorting to massive imports of GMOs from the United States. The CAP must make public health its top priority.

 The previous directive proved to be relevant and effective in enabling, firstly, products to be standardised and the internal Community trade in vine cuttings and plants to develop substantially in recent years. It now needs to be revised to take into account developments in phytosanitary regulations and scientific and technical progress, particularly in the field of in vitro
 propagation. The draft text presented by the European Commission, as amended by the European Parliament Committee on Agriculture and Rural Development, proposes some interesting advances. I shall cite the most significant here. The current draft rules out any possibility of any of the Fifteen Member States enjoying a unilateral exemption from the terms of the directive. This provision, which was not laid down in the initial version of the directive, is preferable as it makes it possible to avoid barriers to trade and to facilitate the movement of propagation material within the European Union. The material produced by in vitro
 herbaceous cutting propagation techniques, which by now have been sufficiently mastered were, of course, not covered by the 1968 directive. The new text introduces provisions recognising special characteristics. While research into a propagation material that is more efficient in health terms is of benefit to the user, it is important that this approach does not create a barrier to trade. The draft amendment seeking to guarantee freedom to market throughout the European Union material that complies with the minimum requirements of the directive should be approved unreservedly. Finally, we must ensure that the new provisions on genetically modified varieties are in every respect compliant and compatible with existing texts, or texts in preparation, in this field. Should this regulatory mechanism need to be expanded or clarified, it would be preferable to delete the provisions relating to this point from the draft directive. We have reason to believe that the new or updated terms of the proposed directive offer a satisfactory response to the expectations of workers in the vine nursery and wine-growing sector and that they should contribute towards improving the quality of the proposed material and make it easier for the competent authorities to supervise the movement of vine cuttings and plants carried out by the institutions responsible for this. The regulations proposed by the directive, moreover, favour the production of diversified plant material by offering the best health guarantees, which is a basic requirement, in order to effectively support the restructuring of the Community vineyard sector, which is a key point in the new COM in wine-growing.

 Mr President, I shall not repeat what our fellow Members have already said, but I believe that all Members of Parliament would agree that overall, culturally appropriate solutions must be found for consumer health. We have a duty to take action. The problems will not, however, be solved by adopting puritanical positions and eliminating aid to producers. Ladies and gentlemen, the consumer and his health must be protected, but this must be achieved logically, by implementing coordinated policies rather than by eliminating the premium for producers. Reducing consumption will cause a decrease in production. Health problems will not be solved tomorrow by importing 100% of our tobacco. On behalf of tobacco producers I would urge the European Parliament, a responsible body, that an overall alternative be proposed to protect consumer health.

Madam President, as you may well expect, we will not enter into a debate between French and British beef producers now. However, I have two questions to ask.

 Mr President, Commissioner, I should like to support Mrs Jeggle’s report and the statements she has made by asking a few very simple questions. Commissioner, I think it is in your interest to use the support offered by the Members of the European Parliament in order to attempt to safeguard your budget for agriculture. When we see the way in which money is being used and diverted to finance other measures, we have good cause to wonder if we shall still have the resources to implement a European agricultural policy after enlargement, and moreover to ensure rural development. When you achieve savings on cereals through moisture rates, how many millions does that amount to throughout Europe? And how are these millions going to be used? Do not forget that it is the intermediate regions that will be the first to suffer the effects, not the good cereal-growing areas, the main cereal-growing areas, but rather the regions where there are average production levels, where many farmers are currently experiencing problems. Looking across the board at agricultural regions, I am forced to note that it is these small- and medium-sized farms whose continuity is not assured, where the farmers’ children are looking for careers outside agriculture. I therefore think that this policy calls for caution, Commissioner. And you have our support. The agricultural budget must be used to promote rural development and to step up support to the family-type farms that exist at grass-roots level, rather than containing only budget measures whose sole purpose is to make savings. Commissioner, we are counting on you a great deal. We are speaking from the bottom of our hearts. Within Parliament we are aiming to defend the family farm.

 Mr President, first of all, I would like to congratulate you on the way you handled the debate this morning. You encountered a storm and weathered it without the help of the Commission. But Commissioner, I would also like, and I feel that this is essential, the institutions of the European Union to bear witness to the solidarity which unites the Member States, in particular in the event of exceptional disasters such as the storms of 26 December last which caused such unprecedented damage to a number of forest regions in France, Germany and Austria.  There is an urgent need for us to begin using the instruments available to the Union to assist the affected regions and support the individuals and companies concerned. The need for our support is all the more pressing given that transportation, storage and forest exploitation cannot be delayed without serious consequences in terms of both the quality of the products and the restoration and protection of forest ecosystems. Thus, in the Alsace region alone, more than 6.5 million cubic metres of woodland has been devastated, which is essentially equivalent to one to three years’ harvests.  Clearly, the influx of timber onto the market will send prices plummeting and so further damage the industry’s economic operators. Once again, the way that the sector is structured may facilitate the search for joint solutions between the upstream operators which manage forestry resources and the downstream operators which exploit them. The inter-trade system introduced in France can certainly play a major part in the search for, and development of, these joint solutions. Indeed, since they are designed not to protect the interests of any one section of the industry, they facilitate the protection of the industry as a whole, promote the timber sector and ensure respect for the great internal balances which make it possible to consolidate the whole. Although regional in scale, inter-trade bodies also have a local impact and are immediately efficacious in critical situations such as that of our forestry companies and the timber industry.  We should therefore favour direct contacts with potential partners, even more so given that inter-trade bodies are also the consultative partners of local governments and national authorities with regard to defining forestry policies and hence with regard to the search for immediate solutions to crises. They are also able to identify bottlenecks in the implementation of safeguard programmes. This is why I ask you not to disregard direct consultation with the industry’s operators in your consultation mechanism.  Moreover, regulations can be a constraint which varies according to the State in question, as is, notably, the case with regard to grain storage, in respect of the impermeability of the ground, the water sampling limits, which are set at 5% of the low water discharge in France and 30% in Germany and waste disposal monitoring. I therefore feel that exceptional measures should also be implemented. The scale of the disaster shows that the aid pledged by the State or confirmed at local level will not be sufficient to cover the damage reported. It is therefore essential to be able to draw on the Structural Funds to finance special measures for forests and the timber industry in the case of disasters in objective 2 or former objective 5b areas. The same applies to rural development measures and other, more specific, economic or environmental programmes, in parallel with actions for using up workable timber, which represents about 50% of the windfall. It would also be desirable to promote incentive measures for using the poorer quality wood for energy production. However, the urgency of the situation calls for flexible, simplified procedures to financially supplement the provisions already introduced by the Member States I therefore call upon the Commission to seek consensus with the industry as a whole and the Member States concerned in order to find effective, immediate solutions, for the greater the consensus, the more effective the solutions will be.

 Mr President, I would very quickly like to go back to the events which took place during the explanation of votes or during the point of order this morning. I am very new to this Parliament and I would just like to express my deep disappointment at the incident. Of course, I respect the Rules of Procedure and democracy, but the strategic, political action of a mere forty or so Members has prevented us from voting on Ethiopia.  On behalf of this Parliament, I would like to apologise to the people of Ethiopia, to the men, women and children who are suffering in a tragic situation and in relation to whom Parliament was prevented from adopting a position this morning. I am extremely concerned. We were able to vote on the last two items, which were also urgent, but, in all honesty, I would have preferred to have voted for the people of Ethiopia and to have lent them the support of this Parliament. Once again, I apologise to the people of Ethiopia.

 Mr President, Commissioner, it falls to me to summarise the problems of the COM in bananas in just a few minutes. That is a considerable challenge and one which makes no sense unless we understand what is really at stake in this issue. It has been a source of conflict for at least a decade, both at the trading level – between the operators – and at the institutional and international level. The reason for that is simple. The banana is now one of the great basic human foodstuffs and control of the trade clearly has a geostrategic dimension. This is a tropical fruit marketed in the Northern hemisphere and its distribution is also a fundamental part of North-South cooperation. The real question we face is whether or not the European Union can succeed in organising, within its own market, a juxtaposition of flows from the producer regions of Europe, the ACP countries and Latin America. Today we are debating a proposal from the European Commission which, by providing for an automatic swing towards tariffs, will lead to the ineluctable disappearance of production in European regions, which currently represents 25% of our market supply. Such a development would be contrary to the actual purpose of regional policy and the common agricultural policy – the two pillars of the European Union – and we do not want that under any circumstances. So we must resolutely set the prospect to one side by adopting the Dary report. I congratulate and thank Mr Dary. For those fundamental reasons, and to protect the interests of consumers on the European market by maintaining a juxtaposition of flows from the Union, the ACP countries and third countries, in the context of genuine and sustained competition based on an adequate number of operators, we ask you to accept all the proposed amendments. Failure on this sensitive banana issue would be an admission of weakness on the part of the European Union and would represent a very strong and rousing signal, exploited by all opponents of the common agricultural policy to oppose the social, family and multi-functional agricultural model. It is our duty to preserve everything the Union stands for, especially on the eve of its enlargement. (Applause)

 Mr President, Commissioner, the beef industry has signed a contract with public opinion, based on the transparency claimed and, I might even say, demanded by the citizen. Today, this transparency is applicable, within the beef industry, to two different but indissociable areas: BSE and labelling. France is stepping up its precautionary measures for specified at-risk materials and is implementing an extensive protocol to evaluate ESB tests on bovine animals. Tomorrow, the European Union is preparing to outline a test programme for all Member States. In this context, consumers would not understand the delays in the matter of labelling. I am therefore particularly concerned to ensure that the operators in this industry are not confronted with a legal vacuum which would lead public opinion, quite legitimately, to wonder whether there is a real desire for greater transparency. How else is it possible to explain the fact that at European level we have managed to obtain an agreement on chocolate but that we are unable to meet the deadlines we set ourselves in an area as sensitive and important as beef. Let us make no mistake as to what is at issue here. I am convinced that the subject of beef labelling is no mere technical issue. I should like to point out that if labelling is of such great importance to consumers it is because it is their guarantee that product traceability has been tightened up, that the operators in the industry and also the European and national public authorities have become more accountable, and that control systems have been improved. Finally, what our fellow citizens are demanding is the right to information. This right to be informed is the natural counterpart to the development of trade and the proper exercise of competition. By virtue of the transparency it conveys, labelling makes it possible to improve the freedom of movement of beef, providing assurances to consumers and guaranteeing their freedom to make an informed choice. In the beef sector, improving consumer information through labelling represents a strong message from Europe to its trading partners: it demonstrates its intention, over and above product health safety, to safeguard the consumer’s freedom of choice.

 Mr President, Commissioner, you have already partially answered the first question on samples. I have a second question for you. I am convinced that, with regard to the consumer, we would be taken more seriously by producers if we were also to do away with the slaughter of animals at risk and if we were to have the same legislation throughout the entire Community. My second point, Commissioner, regards application in 2001. I feel it is necessary, in addition, to include the elimination of the emergency slaughter of diseased animals, so that only actual casualties are subject to emergency slaughter. Control would then be much tighter in the production sector, thus benefiting the consumer.

 Mr President, Commissioner, I too congratulate the rapporteur on his excellent work. I am particularly pleased about the unanimity shown on this issue within the group. It is therefore specified that, through the adoption of a regulation, the Commission will replace the existing authorisations with authorisations linked to the person responsible for putting the additives into circulation. This will occur at the same time for all the additives in question. A coherent legal framework must be re-established. As of October 1999 the Commission proposed introducing a legal basis into Directive 70/524/EEC for the replacement of the authorisations. However, we must ensure that competition distortions are not created, as highlighted by Mr Kindermann and Mrs Auroi. Genetically modified additives must also be clearly identified in feedingstuffs in order to allow the end-consumer to choose food without GMO components or based on GMO components and to guarantee this. The consumer must remain free to make a fully informed decision. This proposal has no financial consequences for the Community budget. There must therefore be total transparency for producers and consumers in the area of food safety. I am sure that the Commission can accept the report which, as you know, was approved unanimously in the Committee on Agriculture and Rural Development.

 Mr President, as I am the last to speak, I shall not repeat what everyone else has said. I would first like to answer the English Member this evening, as there are not many of us and we are all friends here, without stirring up any controversy.  I have already said in this Chamber that British and Irish farmers are in a difficult situation and we must help them. We must work out who should pay and we must make the calculations together. If France has to pay – and perhaps the courts will decide that it must – French politicians will accept their responsibilities, but neither should we forget that those who have not respected the rules on the treatment of meal and who have placed us in this situation must also pay. We must certainly not forget them. Commissioner, my only concern is that the 1997 political commitment not be jeopardised. Why is the Council taking a step backwards? Who are the pressure groups? Knowing, as we do, what has happened throughout the European meat industry and what is still happening in other countries, I wonder. Are there pressure groups forcing it to move backwards, to go back on what has already been done in this industry in terms of labelling and also in terms of the consumer in order to clarify things?  Can you tell us Commissioner, what proposals you have presented to the Council? Because normally, unless I am mistaken, the Commission makes several proposals to the Council when discussions are held, as was the case yesterday.  How do you expect the citizen and consumer to understand this backwards step? Why is the Council rejecting Parliament’s proposal? These are certainly not budgetary measures. As far as abattoirs and traceability are concerned, I think that the Council is adopting a contrary attitude, and will have to accept sole responsibility. I agree with today’s speakers that Parliament must make the Council aware of this. I am therefore counting on you, Commissioner, to act rapidly – and this will be our New Year present for the end of 1999 and in that way Parliament will not be disappointed at the beginning of 2000. You can still intervene and you can still change the Council’s mind.  The second point which I would like to draw to your attention before the start of 2000 is this: let us not wait until December, as we have waited this year until November, to put a definitive regulation on the table. This will enable us to apply it as rapidly as possible, for which, moreover, Mr Papayannakis’ excellent report makes provision.

 Madam President, Commissioner, together with the Scientific Committee, you have taken responsibility for the consumer and I believe that I myself was one of those who have experienced this crisis at first hand and I have always monitored the work of the Scientific Committees. But I think that we must be particularly vigilant as regards the identification of cattle in the different countries of the Community. Of course you have answered one concern in terms of labelling and traceability, and I beg you to do the same, especially in terms of complete transparency throughout the Community on the whole beef and veal sector, whose past we are all familiar with.  So what different control systems are available to you across the Community and how far have you got with the various tests, particularly the BSE test which has been accepted by the Commission?

 Mr President, Mr Martinez will certainly be a hard act to follow.  The violence of the reaction from the Europeans across the channel to the measures taken by the French public authorities, in response to the recommendation by the agency that has already been mentioned here this morning, seems to be out of all proportion. It must be admitted that a three and a half-year ban is extremely harsh and that something that could be mistaken for a lack of goodwill can become the straw that breaks the camel’s back. I know that livestock breeders are suffering enormously and, as a result, I received a number of them in my office on Tuesday. The British are currently trying to set their health concerns about meat from animals fed with banned products, against the health concerns of the French. I would, however, like to clarify a few things. Firstly, the beef war: cattle have not been fed meat meal since 1990 and are thus are no longer a factor in this problem. Secondly, it is undeniable that legal action must be taken against all the practises that have been criticised, and these must be severely censured. Thirdly, France is the only European country, apart from Belgium, to have undergone an inspection from a team of experts from the Commission. Does this mean that the British are not committing any offence, even when we know that their exporters have not had any misgivings about exporting contaminated meal, which was banned in their own country in 1988? They exported it to the Community until 1990, the date of the European ban on these products, and to other countries for a long time afterwards.  I would like to add that measures have been taken in France too, for if there is a sick animal in the herd, the whole herd is killed. We have had 22 cases compared to several thousand in the United Kingdom. It has to be said that this is another reason for the French not to feel particularly reassured any more.  As Northern Ireland is not restricted and transit through France is legal, trade can nevertheless still take place with all European countries except France. For my own information, I shall now ask the European Commission for some technical details. Which European countries are currently buying British meat, and in what quantity? I think that this will shed some light on the matter. All the evidence suggests that French consumers have no blanket, a priori prejudice against British meat: you only have to think of the great quantities of British beef to realise that this is the case. Producers and consumers must realise that the current debate is primarily a debate among scientific experts, who must be allowed to make their case freely. Producers and consumers should also be aware that scientific facts evolve as new discoveries are made.  I hope, for everyone’s sake, that screening tests are quickly implemented. Once the scientific debate is over, everyone will have to face up to his or her own responsibilities. It is indeed vital that the meat on European consumers’ plates is healthy. To conclude, I would like to say that I am delighted to see that throughout this crisis, governments and the respective professional organisations have finally sought to restore the calm that is essential for allowing a debate to progress, a debate which, all the evidence suggests, will not come to an end today, and I would simply ask the British Minister to adopt the same measures adopted by the French Minister.

 Mr President, I would like to draw Parliament’s attention to the fact that the draft budget for 2000 did not envisage any allocation of funds to line B1-3800 concerning the promotion of agricultural products, an amount used solely to discharge the past, and I would of course like to thank the rapporteur, Jean-Louis Bourlanges, for his understanding, and Mr Böge and Mr Görlach for their support. As a result, all the efforts made in favour of quality beef, fruit, vegetables and dairy products would be in danger of being wiped out, even though this action is part of the Community action which could be entered in the green box at the WTO. The pretext of setting up an evaluation study does not justify the suspension of appropriations whose continuation is the guarantee of success. The professionals in the Member States who participate widely in this action are in agreement in favour of a study. Such a study could in particular result in the harmonisation of the Community contribution which currently varies between 40 and 100%, according to the products. For the same period, there are plans to finance a communication action for third countries, but in the absence of an implementing regulation, it will probably not be possible to use the provision in the year 2000. Finally, provision is also made for the promotion of the labelling. The Commission, however, is actually proposing to defer the implementation of labelling for one year, making the promotion of this non-existent product completely useless. It is therefore possible to continue to promote quality products without requiring additional expenditure, and I therefore ask the Commission not to stop promoting quality products, for these products are the external face of difficult regions, local products and the earnings of family farms in Europe.

 Madam President, as I was not allowed to speak in the debate, I hereby submit my intervention in writing, as announced by the President chairing Friday morning’s sitting. He was right to point out that this debate is not the time to state whether we are for or against having the Parliament based in Strasbourg. It is all the more incomprehensible then that he should systematically refuse the floor to MEPs who want to speak in defence of Strasbourg, in response to the attacks on this city which he has allowed others to voice quite freely. I protest strongly at this extremely biased way of conducting the debate, which appears to be an abuse of the Agenda. We have a British gentleman, Lord Bevin, to thank for the choice of Strasbourg as the seat for the Council of Europe, because he saw this city as a symbol of reconciliation between France and Germany, and of reconciliation between all Europeans. We are now at a time when we must go back to fundamental principles, to rise up and outline for our citizens the horizons of our continent’s peace-loving organisation, which respects human rights and is founded on a European model of economic and social development. Bearing this in mind, what do the colours of our buildings’ walls or the pressure of our toilet flushes matter? Any citizen listening to us is going to ask us if we have nothing more urgent to discuss than the details of our own comfort! I am not denying that this building would benefit from some improvements. Anyone who is keen on the use of new buildings, as I am, realises that it takes some time to break them in; in six months time, we will have forgotten these details. I would also like to thank the President, for having shown such great interest in particular problems, and I would especially like to thank and encourage all the staff for their genuine and determined efforts, the effects of which have been very evident this month. We are all concerned about putting the European taxpayer’s money to good use, and I was extremely sorry to hear our Dutch colleague leaping to the defence of “her” taxpayers in an outburst which she felt was appropriate, but which actually showed utter contempt for any concept of European solidarity. Well, I want her to know that my citizens, whom I do not claim to be my own, but whose honour and taxes I shall defend, have, themselves, contributed to the financing of these buildings, and the vast majority of them are extremely proud of this fact. Without matching the huge sums spent on the buildings in Brussels, the European Parliament has, henceforth, a worthy seat which is bound to encourage all those who visit it and work there to act with dignity and with a sense of duty.

 Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, this third report on cohesion undoubtedly rounds off Mr Barnier’s activities now that he is leaving office as a European Commissioner. We owe it to his tenacity and his great powers of persuasion that we can justifiably say that the logic of a policy of mere renationalised charity confined to the poorest has not carried the day. While recognising the need to give priority to the least developed regions, this progress report and the Hatzidakis report largely agree that all the EU’s regions potentially have a need for convergence, competitiveness and cooperation. A policy of achieving economic, social and territorial cohesion by 2013, as required by Article 3 of the draft constitution, therefore seems within reach. This policy is part of the idea of the EU bringing old and new members together in a common project. Even on the territory of the present Union of the 15, there are still areas deserving of aid from the Structural Funds and they must still be shown such solidarity. The Structural Funds’ involvement in the French overseas departments until 2013 strikes me as generally encouraging, but I await the forthcoming report that the Commission is to adopt on the implementation of Article 299(2); this will provide greater detail on the specific funds and the action plan for the grand voisinage
, which ought to benefit the outermost regions. The battle of figures that some are beginning to use polemically in fact masks a fundamental debate about our ambitions for Europe, something which requires a constructive and rational interinstitutional dialogue. That debate cannot be confined to setting a particular ceiling for Community resources; we must calmly reach agreement on the European Project’s actual purpose. Our common objective must therefore be to commit the EU to a sustainable regional policy, as opposed to one which is strictly in response to economic circumstances.

 Mr President, Mr President-in-Office of the Council, ladies and gentlemen, I wish to congratulate the Irish presidency on the work it has done in picking up the thread of an IGC that was cut short in December for the lack of any real political will to complete the institutional reform of the EU, even though this is crucial to the proper functioning of Europe in the years to come. Speaking on behalf of the French delegation within the Group of the European People’s Party (Christian Democrats) and European Democrats, and joining with the great majority of my fellow MEPs, from whom you have already heard, what I ask of the forthcoming Brussels European Council is that it should demonstrate its determination, in political terms, to overcome difficulties which, whilst important, are still secondary to what is really at stake: making the unification of our continent a political, economic and social triumph. It is absolutely vital that the draft constitution put before us by the Convention, the exceptional success of which we can see today in the light of the difficulties the IGC had with it, should be adopted with the minimum possible delay. That is our message to the Irish presidency. Moreover, the Lisbon objectives, which are ambitious but realistic, necessarily involve putting in place proactive policies enabling us to compete with our trading partners, first among them the United States and Japan, in the strategic areas of research and development, education, and lifelong training. Let us therefore implement these necessary reforms and overcome our fruitless divisions in order to make Europe a success on every front. Europe’s citizens will be summoned to the polls in June to elect their MEPs, and they expect more of the European Union than is often articulated. They are relying on us to make it possible for them to live harmoniously beyond their own borders, to work freely and as much as they want, and to save them from being swamped by forms and pointless taxes. Although the Spring European Council is certainly not the culmination of European history, it could well be a key staging post on the way to the speedy adoption of a Constitution and as we progress towards putting in place the economic and trading frameworks that are indispensable if Europe is, at last, to enjoy growth.

 Mr President-in-Office of the Council, Mr President of the Commission, in the six month period starting now, during which Ireland is taking over the Presidency of the Council, there are two important events: the historic unification of Europe with the accession of ten new countries on 1 May and the European elections next June in our twenty-five Member States. The events of the next six months will surely be dominated by the continuance of the Intergovernmental Conference, which is responsible for preparing a new constitution for Europe after the failure of the Brussels summit in December. It is clear that the European Union will be in a better position to welcome these new members if it already has a constitution. You were pragmatic, Mr President-in-Office of the Council, when you recently spoke out against the idea of setting a final deadline for reaching an agreement on the future constitutional treaty. However, you were also wise in warning against extending the IGC too much. Like you, I think that the longer the negotiations go on, the smaller the chances will be of reaching an agreement. I have therefore quite understood your desire to make every effort to encourage the decision-making process, because institutional confusion should not cause us to forget the historic event of the ten new Member States joining the EU, countries that have largely proved themselves worthy of joining a Community of value and freedom. Let us ensure that the indecision that we have been guilty of does not paralyse the entire European plan. In less than six months, the citizens of the united Europe will be called upon, in the European elections, to decide together on the future of our continent. Traditionally, and unfortunately, the electorate is not interested in this vote, because what is at stake seems to be too distant or obscure to them. I hope that the Irish Presidency and all the Member States of the EU will tackle this problem and try to mobilise citizens by organising a European debate giving them a real choice between the different options available to Europe.

Mr President, thank you for giving me leave to express my support for urgent procedure in the case of this proposal for a decision. The proposed instrument provides for the continuation of the system of dock dues, with an exemption mechanism for certain local products from our four French overseas departments of Guadeloupe, French Guiana, Martinique and Réunion, for a ten-year period beginning on 1 July 2004. The proposal also extends the present regime for six months, from 1 January to 30 June 2004, to fill the legal vacuum that has existed since 31 December of last year, the date on which the last statute expired. I wish to commend the content of this proposal, which is the fruit of intensive consultation between the Commission, the French Government and the representatives of the four outermost French regions. My only reticence relates to the lack of flexibility in the exemption mechanism in the case of new products or activities. Be that as it may, this proposal will serve to maintain a vital source of revenue for our local authorities, especially those of the smallest communities. It will thereby help to sustain the present effort to foster the economic development of these areas in pursuance of Article 299(2) of the Treaty. I regret that our Parliament has been unable to devote sufficient time to the drafting of a precise report on the text of this proposal for an instrument that is crucial to the future of our outermost regions. I would nevertheless encourage the House to vote in favour of urgent procedure in order to fill the present legal vacuum, which is liable to have a highly detrimental impact on our overseas departments. We can thus clear the way for the adoption of this new system for the next ten years, leaving the French authorities enough time to transpose the decision into national law by the first of July.

 Mr President, Commissioner, I have listened most attentively to your statement on air safety in a context that is particularly difficult for France after the Sharm el-Sheikh disaster and I have heard your concerns. On my own behalf and on behalf of the members of the French delegation of the Group of the European People’s Party (Christian Democrats) and European Democrats, I want to express our most sincere condolences and our solidarity with the victims’ families. Since it has not yet been possible to analyse the aircraft’s black boxes, it would be irresponsible to draw premature conclusions about this tragedy. For the present, there is nothing tangible that would allow us to call into question either the condition of the aircraft, the professionalism of the Egyptian charter company Flash 
Airlines, the earnestness of the Egyptian civil aviation authority or the reliability of the technical controls that were carried out on that aircraft. From what we know at present, even the hypothesis of an attack cannot be ruled out completely, even if it seems highly unlikely. However, it seems to me essential that European users of air transport should be given every guarantee to reassure them. I would like to take advantage of this session, Commissioner, to pass on to you some of the most frequent questions concerning charter airlines in particular. Would it not be possible to require European tour operators to inform tourists who use their services of the precise identity of the airline they will be travelling with at the time they buy their tickets? In order for European tour operators to be better assured of the level of safety of the airlines they work with, would it not also be desirable to go beyond the random checks that are currently made? Would it not be advisable to recommend real in-depth technical audits of airlines that are not European but which are used by our tour operators?

 Mr President, Mr President-in-Office of the Council, Mr President of the Commission, ladies and gentlemen, the opening last week in Rome of the Intergovernmental Conference, which has the task of producing the definitive text of the European Constitution, was marked by the President-in-Office of the Council’s call for goodwill and by the willing optimism of several Member States including France and Germany. The Italian President-in-Office of the Council stressed that this Conference is the Conference of European will, of Europe’s will to be Europe and political will is going to be the keyword of this Intergovernmental Conference. The groundwork has been done by the European Convention, chaired by Valéry Giscard d'Estaing and it is now up to Ministers to demonstrate that they have this will with, of course, the additional possibility of improving the draft Constitution that we now have. Some Member States of the Union are openly threatening to oppose any outcome that would call into question what they call the ‘Nice acquis
’. I deplore this attitude, because stability must not be confused with stasis. Was it not, after all, the Laeken European Council that fervently wanted the Treaties to be revised to ensure more democracy, more simplicity and more transparency? Besides, following the unanimously acknowledged success of the Community method, so brilliantly illustrated by the European conventions on the Charter of Fundamental Rights and on the Constitution, our partners cannot act as if the Union were simply an intergovernmental organisation. We must lead the way in order to ensure that enlargement is a success. The forthcoming European Council must also apply itself to revitalising the economy, as several speakers have said. On this subject, I am pleased at the growing awareness of the fact that the stability chapter of the European economy should not be able to relegate the chapter dealing with growth, business start-ups and employment into second place. Our citizens expect their leaders to create conditions that will enable Europe to be dynamic, prosperous and more cooperative. Only by freeing our economies of the burden of excessive taxation and excessive bureaucracy will we be able to create lasting wealth and enable the majority of society to benefit from this wealth. This once again requires the political will to undertake reforms that are far-reaching and sometimes relatively unpopular in the short term. Some countries in the Union, including France, are boldly setting about this task and I hope that these efforts are not only acknowledged but also receive encouragement from Europe. Lastly, in the field of external relations, I wish to tell the Presidency of the Union how important we consider the Rule of Law together with protecting human dignity to be in managing the external borders of an enlarged Europe, as well as respect for the international legitimacy of the UN in combating international terrorism. Whether in the European Union or elsewhere in the world, now is the time for multilateralism and for joint action and not for going it alone.

Mr President, Commissioner, in the context of the debate on the future of regional policy, there is a very wide consensus that priority for the least developed regions should be maintained. Concentrating resources on the Objective 1 regions should, therefore, constitute one of the key pillars of cohesion policy for the period 2007–2013, as is the case now. This would be in line with the principles of solidarity and redistribution. The accession of the candidate countries to the European Union will, in statistical terms, reduce the average GDP of the European Union. Accordingly, the Commission’s progress report states that 18 regions should lose Objective 1 status. They would nevertheless benefit from the support provided under the phasing out mechanism. The French overseas departments will not be affected. They will continue to be classed as Objective 1 in 2007, insofar as their per capita GDP will remain well below 75% of the new European Union average. Furthermore, it would be appropriate to foster equality between regions by taking account of the permanent difficulties affecting islands, mountain regions and regions with low population density. Community intervention of this kind would be counterbalanced by a range of territorial criteria. The latter would be used to define priorities and to determine the extent of the means to be allocated. Nevertheless, I feel it is useful to bear in mind that the concept of ultra-peripheral regions must never be confused with that of peripheral regions, islands or structurally disadvantaged regions, regardless of any relationship of solidarity between all these regions. This is because the special legal status of the ultra-peripheral regions is due to their very remoteness from the continent of Europe. The contribution of other European Union policies is the weakest element of the current progress report. In particular, this concerns the system of governance to be implemented so as to ensure that cohesion policy produces the best possible results in the regions concerned. I have in mind agriculture, rural development, transport, innovation, education and training. I am also thinking of competition policy in the context of state aids to regions and tax concessions. I would, however, like to conclude on two encouraging points. Firstly, there is consensus on the need for real improvements to the financial systems and administrative procedures of the Structural Funds. Lastly, I am encouraged that the suggestion that regional policy should be renationalised has lost support. Had it not, it would most certainly have brought European integration to a grinding halt.

 Mr President, allow me to say to you, Mr President-in-Office of the Council, that we have confidence in Italy’s Presidency. We know that you will be able to combine political will and the spirit of conciliation in order to take European integration one stage further. In international affairs, transatlantic relations are obviously fundamental. The European Union’s discussions with the United States, along the lines of those held recently in Washington, must become more regular. Issues such as environmental protection that are the subjects of conflict between the two sides of the Atlantic, should be approached on a more pragmatic basis. We share the opinion of the Italian Presidency on the need for a short IGC, examining, if possible as it stands, the draft constitution of the European Convention and, above all, not re-opening the Pandora’s box of national requests. We are on the verge of adopting a common constitution drawn up in the full light of day. May we succeed in seizing this unique opportunity, and let us get ready for the new constitutional Treaty of Rome. Parallel to the enlargement of the EU, people need to feel safe within the borders of an EU alert to the external threats represented by illegal immigration, organised crime and terrorism. From now on, we need to show the determination required to achieve the desires of the Thessaloniki Council. At an economic level, the Italian Presidency’s plan to give new impetus to the trans-European network of road, rail and sea transport, as well as to the research and development project, is a necessity. As the French Prime Minister, Mr Raffarin, pointed out, the pact that links Europeans to one another is called the Stability and Growth Pact. We are therefore in favour of the European Union taking initiatives in the area of growth. As representative of the overseas regions, I would emphasise the importance, in terms of the EU’s social cohesion, of doing everything possible to open up the regions far from the centre of Europe. European solidarity depends on such efforts. We can only encourage the new Presidency, in the run-up to the Euro-Mediterranean Conference in Naples on 2 and 3 December 2003, to develop its relations, particularly in the field of trade, agriculture, infrastructures and migration, in order to ensure that the Barcelona process does not run out of steam. Finally, we would keenly encourage any European or national policy designed to promote linguistic diversity. A Europe rich in 20 languages and as many cultures must not be reduced to a Europe of just one language. That requires effort on the part of everyone, however, and we await practical initiatives in this area from the new Presidency.

 The outcome of the vote on Parliament's calendar of sessions for 2004, means that only ten plenary sessions will be held in Strasbourg. The treaties and the jurisprudence of the European Court of Justice make it clear that the calendar of the European Parliament must include twelve plenary sessions held in Strasbourg every year, before provision is made for any additional plenary mini-sessions in Brussels. In electoral years of course, the number of plenary sessions held in Strasbourg can be reduced to eleven. It is therefore clear that one Strasbourg session is missing from the calendar adopted for the election year of 2004. We are also faced with the absurd situation that the House has voted to cancel the plenary session in Strasbourg when we were to have welcomed the elected representatives of the new Member States. The House voted to cancel this session on the very day on which we have approved the Accession Treaties for these countries. As Parliament’s vote must be deemed illegal, the French delegation of the Group of the European People’s Party (Christian Democrats) and European Democrats calls on President Pat Cox to deal with the repercussions of this by immediately annulling the vote. We call for a Conference of Presidents to be convened as a matter of urgency to arrange for a new vote as soon as possible, in accordance with Community law.

 Mr President, it has to be noted that there is no legal justification for the decision by the United States to resort to immediate war, as the desired objectives could have been achieved by other means. The inspections produced evident results and, as Mr Blix himself said, opened the way to genuine disarmament by Iraq without the need to engage in armed conflict. President Jacques Chirac and French diplomats have not ceased their unequivocal condemnation of Saddam Hussein's regime. Moreover, they have constantly expressed the concern that Security Council resolution 1441 should be given its full meaning, repeatedly proposing that the inspectors be given further material or legal resources. The position maintained by France is shared by a large section of the international community, and in the Security Council, the sole legal body authorised to legitimise the use of force on an international scale, there has never been a majority sufficient to authorise an early recourse to war. I am horrified by the thought of the consequences of such a war in terms of human lives, both those of the Iraqi civilian population, which has already suffered particularly greatly, and of the British and US armed forces. In the event of a chemical or biological attack, France will give them every support in the form of humanitarian aid. A conflict such as this, however, jeopardises the efforts made over 50 years to build a world founded upon law and collective security. This conflict both greatly endangers the political stability of the Middle East as a whole and creates the risk that terrorism will again inflict devastation on a global scale. All we can do is hope that it will come to an end as quickly as possible. On this sad day, I am extremely proud to be French, for my country has been unstinting in its efforts to attempt to avert this futile war. (Applause from the right)

President-in-Office of the Council, President of the Commission, ladies and gentlemen, our debate on preparation for the Spring European Council is taking place in a tense international context. President Prodi said this in anticipation of the debate that we will have this afternoon on the situation in Iraq. The geopolitical context of the European Council meeting will not only be present in our minds, but also very evident in the data and economic forecasts from our Member States. A climate of international tension is always damaging to the world economy and is one of the major results expected by the terrorist organisations behind that tension. The Council meeting will focus on evaluating the measures that have been implemented in order to achieve the Lisbon objective, which consists of making the European Union the most dynamic knowledge-based economy in the world by 2010. In particular it will involve evaluating the efforts made by the Member States and by the European Union in education, training and also research and development. We are all aware that the results so far do not match up to the Lisbon objectives, but how can we be surprised at this when the governments of most of our countries have no other choice than to remedy the negligence and lack of foresight of their socialist predecessors who, far from making the necessary efforts when there was an opportunity for growth, have spread public resources thinly, sprinkling them between state handout programmes with no future? The Brussels European Council will therefore be a useful opportunity for our countries to reconsider the Lisbon objectives by adapting them to the economic and social reality of our public finances and resituating them in the international context. I would like to conclude by encouraging President Prodi for his initiative in presenting a plan to simplify European legislation, of no less than 90 000 pages. This initiative is more than welcome in order to make life easier for business and therefore to increase the competitiveness of the Union. This plan aims to reduce the acquis communautaire
 to some 25 000 pages between now and 2005 and simplify the language in draft legislation. I do not think that anyone will complain about that.

 Mr President, Parliament is today being called upon to debate a situation which, though it is beyond the borders of our continent, constitutes both a major risk to the unity of Europe and a full-scale test of our countries’ capacity to assert their humanist values at an absolutely critical point in our history. I do not want to understate the disagreements that we are seeing on the international scene, or the need to reach a rapid agreement, in Europe first and then in the United Nations, on the assessment of the risks which are actually facing us and of the diplomatic, political and military means by which we can protect ourselves against them. It seems to me that most of the comments in the media are designed to appeal to the emotions rather than to provide an objective analysis of the situation. The international community as a whole unanimously condemns the current Iraqi regime, its contempt for the most basic human rights, even those of its own people, and its consistent failure to comply with United Nations resolutions, even when it is not busy invading sovereign states. It is against this background that the members of the United Nations, and primarily those of the Security Council, must work steadily towards a consensus on the best way of settling the Iraqi question. In a civilised and democratic world, the world to which we are appealing and the world which the current Iraqi regime is denigrating and making a mockery of, the proper response to a situation of this kind could certainly be a military one, but only after all other possible solutions have been exhausted. Before that, all reasonable solutions should be explored and attempted, or at least that is the idea which we, the representatives of free and democratic countries, have the honour and the duty to recommend and to put into practice. It seems to me to be pointless to compare the current situation with the situation in Europe in the thirties, to caricature the position of the United States, which is quite rightly coloured by the events of 11 September, or to focus attention on the differences of opinion between Europeans, who are split between intensified diplomatic action before any assault and immediate military intervention without any additional delay. Ladies and gentlemen, this is a question of peace or of war, of the life or the death of many human beings. That is what is at stake here, and it leaves little room for taking up positions which are demagogic, precipitate or tactical. Let us all, together, show our sang-froid and our capacity for reflection, and we shall overcome our differences.

 Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, amongst its main objectives, the White Paper proposes giving priority to sustainable development, relaunching maritime and rail transport, fostering intermodality, anticipating the impact of traffic flow generated by enlargement and improving accessibility in peripheral regions. I fully support modal rebalancing, which should be achieved by means of a series of measures combining a review of the charging system with the revitalisation of alternatives to road transport and targeted investment in the trans-European network. We must, however, at all costs not lose sight of the fact that, pursuant to the Maastricht Treaty, transport policies must be designed to serve cohesion and that, in this regard, the trans-European transport network must be an instrument of economic, social and territorial cohesion within the Union. Extremely specific analyses must be carried out on service provision to the peripheral regions, in particular the island regions and outermost regions with, in particular, the establishment of a public service obligation relating to the need to guarantee the principle of territorial continuity and to ensure the best possible operating conditions. There is a genuine lack of decision when the role of transport in the regional development of the peripheral and, a fortiori
, the outermost regions is raised, even though the Treaties recognise in this case the need for treatment that can derogate from common transport market rules. The particularly worrying situation of the provision of air services to the French overseas departments following the dismantling of Air Lib, an airline partly specialising in these flights, is a perfect example of the current gaps that I have just mentioned. It also illustrates the urgency of a joint vision of the future of development in the outermost regions, within which the transport regulation policy would meet the regional development policy. I am not sure that the White Paper, which, in particular, addresses this matter from the point of view of introducing more flexibility into the Community framework on aid for regional purposes in the field of transport services, in particular where links with the peripheral regions and the small islands are concerned, has fully appreciated the importance of this crucial matter for the European peoples concerned.

 Mr President, Mr President-in-Office of the Council, President of the Commission, ladies and gentlemen, in closing the Copenhagen European Council which brought together the Heads of State and Government of the Fifteen Member States, the President-in-Office, Mr Rasmussen, stressed the truly historic nature of this event which puts an end to the period of separation. The subject of our work over recent days was a common vision for the future of our continent. A stroke of good luck but also intense and extremely commendable work by the Union, and especially by the candidate countries, has meant that the enlargement process, launched in 1992 in the Danish capital and forming the basis of the famous political criteria, named after Copenhagen, on democracy, the rule of law and human rights, has been completed in the same place. Look at how much progress has been made over the last 50 years! Look at how many barriers have been torn down, how many misunderstandings have been overcome! Twenty-five – soon to be twenty-seven – States are finally working together to achieve the objectives of freedom, democracy and responsibility. Such cooperation honours the fight that millions of our predecessors waged at the price of intense suffering and sacrifice. We still have a great deal of difficult ground to cover, no one has any illusions about this. The European Union must, in particular, respond to the need to make fundamental changes to the way it works and to its institutions. This is the work that the European Convention must bring to a successful conclusion under Mr Valéry Giscard d'Estaing. We hope that the European Convention will lead to a draft for a single constitutional treaty that is legible and which responds to the need for a Europe that is more efficient, more democratic and perceived to be more legitimate by all European citizens. Unless we fundamentally reform the way in which the European Union currently works, Europe’s reunification will lead to weaker political will within Europe and this is something that we certainly do not want.

 Mr President, Ireland’s ratification, on Sunday last, of the Treaty of Nice is to be welcomed with open arms since their approval will enable the Union to prepare itself for its historic enlargement, welcoming the countries of Central and Eastern Europe as well as Cyprus and Malta. The Danish Presidency of the Union recently indicated that, if necessary, it would prolong the summit which is due to take place in Brussels on 24 and 25 October, so that it could complete all the items on a particularly demanding agenda, as President Prodi reiterated earlier. On Monday last, Commissioner Verheugen expressed regret that France is not adopting a more flexible attitude regarding the possibility of reducing direct aid to farmers, before deciding on the amount of aid to make available to the farmers of the future new members, and he considered that the sudden increase in agricultural expenditure would make the CAP a logical area where money could be saved. With respect, I would like to say to the Commissioner that I find this view particularly unbalanced. President Jacques Chirac yesterday called for a solution to be found that is acceptable to everyone for financing the enlargement of the European Union, and for this to be done at the end of a working meeting with the President-in-Office of the Council, Mr Rasmussen. The French Government believes all planned expenditure in the EU budget must be examined and a limit on this expenditure must be imposed. By undertaking a thorough review of the financial commitments of all the Member States and by ensuring they are fairly balanced, we will succeed in finding a solution acceptable to all, so that enlargement can be carried out under the best possible circumstances. I am sure that France is very willing and will shoulder its part of the effort that is required in finding a fair solution as soon as possible. This could not be achieved, however, by sacrificing a sector of our population, in this case, farmers and the rural community. The financial contribution that is justifiably anticipated must be divided equally between all the Member States of the European Union.

 Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, I would also like to express my satisfaction regarding the rapid creation of this emergency aid fund that can be called upon in cases of major disasters, since victims have the right to expect the European Union to provide them with solidarity and assistance. I also regret, however, that this statement is only being made after several years of repeated requests to the European executive to set up an instrument of this sort, the lack of which was, for example, particularly marked following the storms which hit France in December 1999. Mr Savary mentioned this earlier. The powerlessness and inertia of the Community in such circumstances have been very badly perceived by the general public, even though efforts were undertaken to bring Europe closer to its citizens. Today, following the catastrophic weather in central Europe and in the south of France, the imminent prospect of the implementation of an emergency fund with an annual grant of EUR 1 billion may, at last, give slightly more credibility to the concepts of European solidarity and a common destiny. In this respect, I believe it is essential to congratulate, in particular, Commissioner Barnier, who succeeded in drafting a proposal for a regulation of very high quality in a record time. The Fund will provide emergency aid to any area affected by a major disaster, whatever its status with regard to the Structural Funds. An additional qualitative criterion stipulates that, in very exception circumstances, namely when the disaster affects a substantial part of the population of the region or the State concerned, the assistance from this Fund can therefore be used. I knew that we could count on you, Commissioner, for this provision to include the particular case of the outermost regions, whose geographical and climatic situation often causes dramatically poor weather that has devastating consequences on their relative prosperity. Article 299(2) of the Treaty must be able to be applied, including in the scenario in question that I obviously do not wish to see happen again in a hurry.

 The European Council in Seville, which marks the end of a very positive Spanish Presidency, will focus on the fight against illegal immigration, enlargement and the future of the European Union, including a presentation by President Valéry Giscard d'Estaing on progress with the work of the Convention. The General Affairs Council, which met yesterday in Luxembourg, demonstrated the widespread confusion about the proposals on the reform of the common fisheries policy in all the countries where this sector is of economic, social and cultural importance. We expect the Community to advocate reason, moderation and cooperation. The European Council should approach the problem of illegal immigration in the wider context of a common policy on asylum and immigration. It should concentrate on the common administration of the external borders of the Community of Fifteen and on integrating migration policy in the EU's external relations. It should address the public's expectations without resorting to populism but with all the firmness that this very worrying situation demands. The enlargement negotiations have made good progress under the Spanish Presidency. However, the concerns of the agricultural and rural world which were demonstrated in Strasbourg on Tuesday indicate the vital importance of entering into dialogue before taking decisions affecting millions of Europeans.

Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, every year, around 200 million Europeans leave their place of normal residence to become tourists for a while, usually in other countries of the Union. As Mrs Torres Marques rightly states, Europe remains the main tourist destination for third countries, despite facing increasingly stiff competition. Nevertheless, the Treaties provide no specific legal base for a Community policy on tourism, despite the fact that our Parliament has been calling for such a policy for a considerable amount of time in order to give the Community major scope for intervention whilst respecting the principle of subsidiarity. Since the Treaties do not provide for such a measure, the European Union must contribute to improving and encouraging cooperation in this sector in order to harness the enormous potential of tourism. I welcome the efforts of the Commission, whose communication proposes an operational framework for European tourism as well as a range of measures and actions to be implemented by the various players involved. The Commission highlights the complexity of this sector due to its diversity and its wide-ranging nature, which gives it little visibility at political level, a situation that does not properly reflect its true economic and social importance. The Commission has, however, shown a lack of ambition: its proposal does not raise hopes that a real boost will be forthcoming because it fails to envisage a genuine strategic framework for monitoring an industry with enormous potential but which is experiencing little growth. I agree with all of the recommendations contained in Mrs Torres Marques’s excellent report, not least making tourism an issue to be considered by the Convention on the future of Europe and I do not think that a joint action runs counter to national actions to promote tourism. Employment in the tourism industry is often highly seasonal and precarious, which is an obstacle to achieving sustainable development in this field. I therefore call on the Commission to draw up at the earliest opportunity proposals to include the restaurant sector, and possibly other as yet ineligible tourist services, on the list of sectors of activity entitled to a permanent reduction in the VAT rate, so as to boost employment and modernisation in the industries concerned and better equip European tourism to deal with international competition. Furthermore, know-how in the field of management and technology must be acquired and spread in order to encourage new methods of production and to promote a form of tourism that responds as well as possible to changes in the market. Tourism is also a crucial element for the economic development of certain regions of the Union whose development is lagging behind, and for the outermost regions in particular, the tourist industry is the leading source of income and contributes significantly to their efforts to ensure the convergence of their economies towards the Community’s average rate of development. Tourism whose development is handled with prudence over the long term must provide local economies with a source of sustainable income and employment and must also contribute towards safeguarding and enhancing the landscape, cultural, historical and environmental features of the regions of the Union. Lastly, I wish to stress the crucial role that the European Union must play in encouraging new forms of tourism in new places, not least by helping continental Europeans to discover the wonders of Europe’s outermost destinations.

 Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, I would like to point out that the compensation scheme for additional costs incurred by outermost regions in the marketing of certain fishery products – incorrectly referred to as the ‘Fish POSEIDOM’ – is based on a simple principle, namely to support the marketing of species that are most commonly sold outside the European Union, in conditions similar to those in which the economic agents in Europe operate. I would like to congratulate the rapporteur on his work, which meets the expectations of the representatives of the European Union’s outermost regions. However, as shadow rapporteur, I would like to make two additional comments. In the comprehensive list of disadvantages facing the outermost regions, the rapporteur has failed to mention a difficulty which, in my opinion, is of utmost importance, namely the problems of reaching these areas as a result of the transport links between the regions and the continent and the prices charged for this travel. And for us in the far-flung regions, this problem can increase prices by around 30%. I also note that the rapporteur bases his report – and this is obviously something that I welcome – on Article 299(2) of the Treaty of Amsterdam, which recommends that the special characteristics of outermost regions be taken into account in each of the European Union’s policies, especially in the case of fisheries. I think, however, that it would have been more logical to refer in full to Article 37 of the Treaty, which represents the very foundation of the fisheries and agricultural policies, had this Article not proved lacking as regards the EU’s outermost regions. It turns out that it is totally inappropriate in its current form since it takes into account continental fishing conditions only and fails to consider situations related to remoteness. Lastly, I fully support the rapporteur’s proposal which calls on the Commission to forward to the European Parliament a copy of the report carried out for the Commission by external consultants on the impact of all Community measures adopted to date in the fisheries sector for the outermost regions. If we were familiar with the content of this document, it would certainly give us more accurate information to consider when taking into account the specific problems of the outermost regions of the EU.

 Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, the European Parliament’s major political groups reached a compromise within the Committee on Regional Policy, Transport and Tourism on the Council’s common position on opening the Union’s postal services to competition and I congratulate Mr Ferber on this achievement. The postal system is a service of general interest as well as an economic activity. The performance of the postal services contributes to the performance of the national economies and certain sectors, particularly banking, insurance or distance selling. At a time when we are setting up, in tandem with the single currency, the internal market of financial services, where we are trying to provide a favourable framework for e
-commerce in Europe, we cannot ignore the demands from these sectors to improve services and reduce the costs of postal services. A certain degree of competition, along with increased demands for quality services, encourages transparency of costs and contributes to the competitiveness of consumer or user activities of the postal services by giving them potential openings. I am, however, firmly against all types of full liberalisation, as the services of general economic interest play a role in the economic, social and territorial cohesion of the European Union. The European Charter of Fundamental Rights acknowledges the principle of access to the service of general economic interest as laid down in national legislation and practices. The importance of access to postal services is not the same in a country with 17 000 post offices and in a country that has barely one thousand. We must therefore guarantee that the opening up to competition will not have any negative consequences on the access to postal services in the most isolated or most remote regions. In other words, I think that the modernisation of the postal services under the guise of competition is now required in order to develop these services and, more broadly speaking, for the competitiveness of our businesses. This liberalisation must, however, be gradual and controlled in order to preserve adaptability, economic viability and guaranteed access to the universal postal service throughout the Union’s territory. I think that the compromise before us brings together both these aims and that is why I will vote in favour of it tomorrow.

 Mr President, Mr President-in-Office of the Council, ladies and gentlemen, when I spoke to you in January during the debate on the priorities of the Spanish Presidency, I stressed that the European Union could learn a great deal from Spain, with its largely successful policy that the Prime Minister, Mr José María Aznar, has pursued for several years. Today I can only repeat what I said then and say it more firmly, in the run-up to the Barcelona European Council. At Lisbon, against the backdrop of a difficult international economic climate, the EU Heads of State and Government expressed the desire to make the European Union, in the medium-term, one of the most competitive, most dynamic and most prosperous regions of the world. The Barcelona Summit must ensure that this desire does not turn out to be a vain hope and that the economic, social and environmental reforms contained within this ambitious objective are carried through to completion and that they are not allowed to be deferred. We must take the euro as a starting point to achieve a seamless Europe, where the markets are fully integrated, a Europe where businesses, workers and students can use the whole of the Union as a reference and as a sphere of action. There is no better way for our fellow citizens to achieve social integration than by undertaking a professional career. The new phase in the employment strategy must place more emphasis on the structural barriers to job creation, on the tax regimes and social welfare systems, and enable closer cooperation between the national services that are tackling unemployment. In all these areas, it is not the time to withdraw into oneself, to be overcautious, or reckless. Just as some countries of the European Union are single-handedly conducting a policy resulting in restricting people’s will and ability to start up a business, work, and therefore hire employees, other countries of the Union, of the eurozone, are establishing an environment enabling everyone to develop their spirit of initiative and creativity. I therefore hope that the Barcelona Summit is an opportunity for Europe, for the whole of Europe, to move in another direction, which encourages dynamism, entrepreneurial freedom, competitiveness and responsibility.

 Article 299(2) of the Treaty provides for the possibility of introducing special measures in order to ensure the survival of activities in the outermost regions where a climate of legal certainty is greatly needed if economic operators are to maintain their position and to grow. The production of rum has a major impact on the economy of the French overseas departments as 40 000 jobs are involved. The Council Decision of 1995, which is due to expire at the end of this year, authorises France to impose a reduced rate of excise duty within French metropolitan territory for “traditional” rum produced in the French overseas departments. The current review of the COM in the sugar sector and the dismantling of customs barriers in 2003 have led France to propose that these tax arrangements be maintained beyond 2002 on the grounds that the measures adopted at national and Community level would not in themselves be enough to allow FOD products to compete with products from other regions. In order to preserve this traditional agricultural activity, which generates jobs at every stage of cane-sugar-rum production, the current system sets a minimum level for imports from the FOD into France which is strictly limited and supervised in order to compete with the ever-increasing sales of rum from third countries, which are not subject to the same production specifications. In order to ensure the survival of the sector, rum producers in the FOD are obliged to use local raw materials, which guarantees quality, but which, for example, prevents Guadelupian rum from being produced using cane from Martinique as well as from third countries. Rum from the overseas departments is therefore obliged to participate in the FOD rural development policy, which increases restrictions and production costs and places it in a disadvantageous position on the market in relation to products from third countries. The dispensational tax system therefore merely aims to compensate for the obligation incumbent on FOD producers to participate in the survival of the cane-sugar-rum sector.

One of the greatest achievements of European integration was a result of the decision, in 1975, to bring about the solidarity and cohesion needed to reduce the gap between the economic levels of all the EU States and regions. Today, we can say that the way we adapt our Community cohesion policy with a view to enlargement will determine the quality of the Union’s future development. The European Parliament has, quite rightly, for a long time supported the idea that an appropriate economic and social cohesion policy cannot be reduced to the level of taking from the rich to give to the poor. It is the analysis of genuine needs, magnified by the prospect of enlargement, that should be considered as a priority, and not fixed references to budgets set in the past for different contexts. For, as the European Commission points out, enlargement will increase the development differential between the centrally located territories, on the one hand, and the peripheral and outermost regions on the other. In this regard, I would call for the outermost regions to continue to be considered a regional and cohesion policy priority, through further advances to be made with the implementation of Article 299(2) of the Treaty. Furthermore, we need to adapt competition policy, particularly national regional aid, and tax policy in order to strengthen regional and cohesion policy, with the understanding that the Structural Funds are not sufficient to counterbalance the handicaps and the delays in development accumulated over several decades. We also need to prepare for the revision of the common agricultural policy and rural development, in order to better coordinate the urban and rural dimensions of regional development. Finally, it would appear urgent to create a European monitoring centre for territorial cohesion. (Intervention cut short pursuant to Article 137 of the Rules of Procedure)

 Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, the Structural Funds were designed to support the effort that the Member States put into their regional development policy and thus to strengthen the economic, social and territorial cohesion of the European Union. It must be noted that the aid provided by the Structural Funds to the most disadvantaged regions is absolutely vital and that the contribution of these funds has become essential in enabling certain regions, which are lagging behind in development, to catch up, particularly the outermost regions, which I know well. The start of the new 2000-2006 programming period has once again shown us the problems in the practical implementation of the Structural Funds, with the Member States regretting the time taken by the Commission to approve the general programme guidelines and the Commission criticising the time taken by the Member States to submit their programming plans and the additional information requested. It is essential that the next programme negotiations are kept within strictly limited, precise and binding time limits, so that the Member States and the Commission respect the rules laid down. The time that elapsed between setting up the programmes is, without doubt, one of the reasons that explains why the initial figures on their execution are so disappointing, but this is, of course, not the only explanation. Following Agenda 2000, the processing of the funds was decentralised and each Member State gained overall responsibility for implementing, monitoring and ensuring the efficiency of the structural interventions on its territory. As for France, I wish to formally appeal to the prefects of the regions that are eligible for Objectives 1 and 2 to make every effort to mobilise and encourage those responsible for the projects and to give them all the necessary technical support to enable them to carry out the programmes more successfully. Unfortunately, it is often difficult to involve businesses in Community programmes, since the management of the projects appears complicated and the procedures appear slow. This is an aspect that the national authorities must focus on, without fail, in order to enhance the attraction of Structural Funds in the private sector. Lastly, to conclude with a firm proposal, I think that one of the ways to simplify and lighten the administrative burden would, in fact, be to introduce a single regional development fund in 2007.

 Mr President, the common fisheries policy is one of Europe’s sensitive policies. It is characterised by the confusion between the general interests of a common policy, which is dedicated to managing a declining resource, whilst rationalising a traditional economic activity, and the objectives for developing extremely remote regions, for which fishing is one of the few sectors of activity that provides medium- and long-term employment. The Commission Green Paper on the Common Fisheries Policy paints a very gloomy picture and I regret that it contains no reference whatsoever to fishing in the territorial waters of extremely remote regions of the European Union. The ideas that are proposed, and above all, the solutions advocated, are obviously designed to meet the challenge posed by continental fishing and are poorly adapted to extremely remote regions. These regions have fought for respect for their differences, as laid down in Article 299(2) of the Treaty of Amsterdam, and so that their specific characteristics can, at last, be taken into account in each of the European Union’s policies and, more importantly, in the common fisheries policy. The dimension of this sector in extremely remote regions, its characteristics and, above all, its impact on all fishing activities in Europe should, however, make it much easier than anticipated to justify the practical and specific measures for extremely remote regions, particularly in terms of resource and fleet quotas, of support for coastal fishing and aquaculture, as well as public limits on investment, upon which the growth of this activity in these regions depends. An adequate level of investment would enable them to develop and to modernise their fleets, to ensure greater coherence in the measures proposed by the European Commission by reconciling, on the one hand, the objectives for providing financial support to the businesses involved in processing and selling fish products and, on the other, the need to ensure that these businesses receive a regular supply of high quality raw materials. Lastly, I would like to add that we should be careful when concluding international fishing agreements and ensure that they take into account, where applicable, the proximity with extremely remote regions. Fishing licences issued by third countries to Community fishing vessels should be given, first and foremost, to fishing vessels from the extremely remote regions that are nearest and should not be seen as a means of dislodging the European fleet. I cannot conclude without congratulating Mrs Miguélez Ramos on the remarkable and difficult work that she has done to enable us to reach a consensual and satisfactory document. It is a task that seemed almost insurmountable.

 Mr President, Mr President-in-Office of the Council, Mr President of the Commission, the Spanish Presidency of the European Union has given itself the theme of ‘More Europe’, which is a desire shared by a large majority of Europeans who, as of 1 January 2002, now share the same currency. ‘More Europe’ must not mean more of an omnipresent, over-bearing Europe. On the contrary, ‘More Europe’ must mean more of a political Europe where it is necessary to improve our standing on the international stage and to enable our economies to become stronger and to create further jobs. Spain is undertaking its third presidency of the Union and therefore has proven experience in this area. More importantly, the Spanish government led by Mr José Maria Aznar, whom I welcome, is implementing a successful policy which, if applied to Europe, could turn out to be extremely worthwhile. As far as the fight against terrorism is concerned, there is, unfortunately, no need to dwell at length on the tragedies that too often plunge the people of Spain into mourning, as they fall victim to barbaric acts carried out by ETA and its counterparts. It is now easy for us to understand, particularly after the events of 11 September, that the primary concern of the Spanish Presidency is, quite clearly, the fight against terrorism within an area of freedom, security and justice. However, what citizens really expect from Europe, and from the authorities in general, is for us to put in place the conditions to create a competitive economy that will guarantee the prosperity of as many people as possible. Mr Aznar, you know how to do this in Spain; we are sure that you will provide the necessary impetus so that the objective set in Lisbon to achieve full employment by 2010 is consolidated and attained within the framework of a timetable defined at Barcelona in March. It will come as no surprise to any of you that, having been elected to represent the island of Reunion, I welcome the will that was clearly expressed by the Spanish Presidency to pursue the implementation of Article 299(2) of the Treaty of Amsterdam, so that the special characteristics of such regions are taken into account in each of the European Union’s policies. Lastly, I would like to point out to the President-in-Office of the Council that the first meeting of the Convention will not be held at the European Parliament’s headquarters in Strasbourg; it will instead take place in one of our working places, namely Brussels.

Mr President, the Representative of the Council, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, the Laeken European Council which concludes the Belgian Presidency of the Union has been a success. I do not say this out of courtesy or convenience but because I profoundly believe that the Heads of State and Government, over recent days, have sent the signal that the Europeans were waiting for, one of clarity and the rejection of pretence. The Laeken Summit has achieved its main ambition: to adopt a declaration on the future of Europe, opening the way to the future great reform of the Union. As the President-in-Office of the Council has stressed, there was no taboo at Laeken, no issue has been avoided, and I hope that this formula will become a reality, since European construction has too often been opaque, or at least the reserve of the initiated. Please allow me, on behalf of the French delegation of the PPE-DE Group, to express our pleasure at the nomination of Mr Valéry Giscard d'Estaing as president of the Convention, as well as Mr Giuliano Amato and Mr Jean-Luc Dehaene as vice-presidents. These eminent people are renowned for their experience and their determination to persuade people to favour a Europe which fully and democratically carries out its competences, but only its competences, which would be clearly defined. At a time when Europe has a currency, is being enlarged and is trying to provide globalisation with a soul and with values, it is high time that we reviewed our vision of public life and the relations between our citizens and their institutions at all levels. A new era was begun at Laeken. We are delighted. But there is still a long way to go. We must therefore continue with our efforts. ***

Mr President, the fisheries agreements the EU has signed with third countries have always formed a decisive part of its common fisheries policy. I want to pay tribute to the excellent work carried out by Mrs Fraga Estéves, the rapporteur. As a Member from Réunion, I am naturally interested in the conclusion of this seventh fisheries agreement between the EU and Madagascar, given its implications for fishing in the Indian Ocean and, obviously, off Réunion too. Let me start by pointing out that there is an enormous paradox between the restrictions imposed by the establishment of a European common fisheries policy and the precautionary principle the European Union advocates. In fact, at the same time that the Commission was refusing to countenance any increase in the rate of public aid for longliners in Réunion on the grounds that this resource could be at risk in this part of the Indian Ocean, it was also saying that this same resource was abundant enough to allow for an increase in catches under its fisheries agreements with third countries. For those of us who come from Réunion, this is rather difficult to understand, as, moreover, I explained, in Réunion, to some of our MEPs in the Committee on Fisheries, pointing out that the fishing resources of this sector are young, specific and over-abundant, with the result that the catch quota criteria imposed by the common fisheries policy are inappropriate. The rapporteur refers to the increased fishing opportunities given under the agreement between the EU and Madagascar, which will make it easier for fishermen from Réunion to acquire additional fishing rights in Malagasy territorial waters. We would be allowing them to increase their catch quota, which, at present, accounts for only 0.12% of the total EU catch in this zone. The fisheries agreements are the EU's main instrument for contributing to the development of the fishing industry in third countries. A large part of the total financial contribution is allocated to this under the agreement with Madagascar. Since it is quite familiar with the real situation in Madagascar, Réunion is prepared to offer its experience and to take part in co-development projects, based, in particular, on the creation of joint enterprises with Madagascar and the development of aquaculture. In fact, some projects of this kind have already been conducted and simply need reinforcing. Finally, I do hope the European Union will adopt a strict policy with regard to poaching in the Indian Ocean. Madagascar has recently signed bilateral agreements with Japan, Taiwan and Korea, the terms of which are not always entirely clear. I therefore feel it is crucial for the European Union to keep a very close watch specifically over the implementation of the special surveillance and monitoring measures aimed at restricting poaching activities in this zone and thus to ensure that the signing of the fisheries agreement with Madagascar is genuinely and indisputably valid.

Mr President, today I must join with the authors of the joint resolution in standing against the failure to respect human rights in Vietnam. The European Parliament has spoken out many times on this matter, the last time only three months ago, to condemn the violation of the freedom to practice religion. The country, which is still run by a Communist party, still represses, on a daily basis, any group or individual considered to be a threat by those in power. My fellow Members have already said that the freedom of the press, freedom of opinion, religion and association, rights of ownership and the right to vote are flouted. What is also serious is that no international organisation or independent observer is authorised to come and monitor the human rights situation in the country. Let us recall that in April, Vietnam celebrated the 25th anniversary of its reunification. The Vietnamese government, which has signed many international conventions on human rights, had an excellent opportunity on that occasion to reaffirm the commitments it had given in that respect. Vietnam is demanding a place on the international stage and has potentially everything in its favour to become a prosperous country. Reality, unfortunately, shows the situation to be quite different. The Vietnamese people live in poverty, their society is in decline and the country is still under-developed. By signing a partnership and cooperation agreement with the European Union in 1995, Vietnam gave a formal commitment to respect human rights and promote democracy. The joint EC/Vietnam Committee that met in September in Hanoi reconsidered all the aspects of relations with the European Union, including the joint agreement on democracy, good governance, human rights and the rule of law. I call on Parliament today to give its full support to the European Commission in implementing its partnership strategy in the region. We must all encourage the process of reform in Vietnam. Respect for fundamental freedoms, freedom of expression and freedom of conscience should constitute the basis of sound and constructive cooperation with that country.

Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, I would first like to express my great satisfaction at being able to speak for the first time in this House on the issue of the Overseas Countries and Territories. These twenty territories benefit from a particular association arrangement with the European Union, which, when described in simple terms, is less favourable than the status reserved for the outermost regions, which are integral parts of the Union, but more advantageous than the agreements made with third countries in Africa, the Caribbean and the Pacific. As a French overseas member of this Parliament my attention is naturally drawn to the fate of the French territories and administrative authorities concerned, which are, and I am pleased to list them here, New Caledonia, French Polynesia, the French Southern and Antarctic Territories, Wallis and Futuna, Mayotte and Saint-Pierre and Miquelon. In his excellent report, Mr Fruteau welcomes the progress in relations between the European Union and the OCTs from an institutional, economic and financial point of view, even though there remain many questions on the Commission’s proposals having to respond to the objectives included in declaration 36 with regard to the OCTs annexed to the Treaty of Amsterdam. With regard to trade relations, the rapporteur emphasises the low level of trade with the Union. In 1998, imports from OCTs amounted to 0.21 % of Community imports, with exports to OCTs amounting to 0.43 % of Community exports as a whole. A liberalisation of trade with OCTs could fulfil the objectives we have set ourselves. We should be particularly careful, however, that this liberalisation does not result in some kind of diversion from our current objectives. For several years, imports have been increasing from a particular OCT (which happens to be Aruba but this is not the time to hold it up as an example), which runs counter to the spirit of this association agreement with the European Union. These products exported to the Union do not come from the OCT, but are imported there from ACP countries for minor processing such as the whitening of rice, sifting, packaging or mixing. These simple operations only require very low levels of investment, and are therefore in no way a development factor as the Court of Justice in Luxembourg highlighted in its ruling on the "Emesa sugar" case in 1998, as the only interest is providing easy added value for international operators. The increase in this type of inefficiency is all the more intolerable given that it goes against the interests of the other OCTs, the outermost regions and the ACP countries. In this context, without questioning the objectives proposed by the rapporteur, which I willingly support, it is essential that we establish strict original rules to prevent these breaches , which are detrimental to the economies of all overseas territories. In this respect, the measures for prohibiting cumulation of origin for certain products, increasing the list of inadequate processes or the systematic implementation of safeguard clauses in no way provide a suitable response to this problem.

 Following Monday's statement by Mrs Christine de Veyrac, Deputy Mayor of Toulouse, I want to express the sympathy and solidarity of the entire French delegation of the PPE-DE Group towards our compatriots struck by disaster at the AZF factory in Toulouse, and, in particular, towards the victims and their families. Let me also pay tribute to all those who responded with such extraordinary courage and provided help, medical care and assistance to all the many victims. Information to date suggests that this was an accident, although it is too early to be entirely sure. If that is indeed the case, we will have to check whether all the necessary safety measures and precautions were taken, given that this factory was classified as presenting a major industrial risk. The real question is to find out whether the provisions of the 1982 and 1986 Seveso directives, which provide for all the necessary procedures and all the danger scenarios, are being observed on such sites in the European Union and to check whether the risk reports are updated on a regular basis. We also need to check whether the plans are operational and tested, whether the national administrations have the means of inspecting all these installations and whether the no-construction zones are being respected. Above all, we must learn from this tragedy that has struck the inhabitants of Toulouse, to ensure that in future the people of the European Union are protected once and for all from such terrible explosions.

 The social fabric of many coastal zones has been altered over recent years by the restructuring of the fisheries and traditional agriculture sectors. Although certain regions have been faced with an exodus of their endogenous population, most of the coastal zones are experiencing an increase in overall demographic pressure, as well as significant seasonal variations in employment, essentially linked to tourism. Major works required for urbanisation and development can threaten the coastal environment if carried out without sufficient knowledge of the coastal dynamic, by accelerating the erosion of the seashore. Furthermore, pollution of marine or terrestrial origin is increasingly contaminating soil and drinking water resources. The coastal territories are the focus of constant antagonism and conflict. Lack of integrated management of maritime and terrestrial resources causes serious tension between the various sectors of activity, namely fisheries, agriculture and services, with the consequence that the sustainable development of the coastal areas is put on hold. The strategy proposed by the Commission is an interesting approach intended to resolve the fundamental problems facing the coast: lack of information, insufficient participation by the population in projects, weak coordination between the various planning authorities and absence of real partnership which involves the economic sectors concerned, the regional and local authorities and the interregional organisations, in decision-making. However, it is essential for the strategy for coastal zones to constitute one of the first examples of implementation of the guidelines developed under the European Spatial Development Perspective, because the principles set out in it are obviously valuable for the Union’s coastal zones. This could even be an excellent occasion to restore vigour to a particularly inert ESDP, whose true impact still remains very limited. Finally, I would like to express my agreement with those who regret that the Commission’s proposal does not take account of climate change, when that appears to have an influence on rising sea levels and increasing storm frequency, contributing decisively to risks of flooding, coastal erosion and loss of seashore. Although we are only now beginning to recognise the new challenges that will face the coastal regions in the decades to come, the integrated coastal zone management strategy cannot decently ignore them.

 Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, the nine proposals for regulation that have been submitted to us today represent the first wave of measures adopted for the outermost regions following the entry into force of Article 299(2) of the Treaty of Amsterdam. Even if the Commission has not yet addressed all of the requests made by the Member States, these new proposals are particularly important and open up the way to greater changes. With regard to the structural measures, we can take satisfaction from the fact that the Commission is proposing to raise Structural Fund assistance rates and the public subsidy limit for the outermost regions, even though the aim is really to enable these regions to regain funding levels close to those in force in the previous programming period. Nevertheless, I am sorry that the increase in these rates only target closed investment categories. The consequence of this will be to impose a major limit on the scope of the measure and, ultimately, to prevent the outermost regions from matching their situation in the 1994-1999 period. With regard to the revision of the agricultural chapters that have been submitted, we should emphasise that this is part of a very limited budgetary context, which is having a very powerful effect on the content of the measures and their scope. I must remind you that the total appropriations for the programme of options specific to the remote and insular nature of the overseas departments (POSEIDOMs) have been reduced by 25%, falling from EUR 46 million to EUR 35 million in the 2001 budget, whereas the financial forecasts for funding the reform stated that the financial requirement for 2001 was EUR 55 million. Without going into detail on the proposals, which are, on the whole, a step in the right direction, it is crucial that Article 299(2) should be kept as the legal base for this text and that the continuity of these measures is guaranteed in order to compensate for the delay by the Commission in drafting them and to prevent any interruptions to funding. Lastly, with regard to the proposal for a regulation on the Financial Instrument for Fisheries Guidance (FIFG), the special rates for fleet renewal and modernisation measures must be applied to ships of up to 16 metres in length. This is a fundamental issue for fishing in Réunion. I would ask you to support these proposals and the two amendments that I have re-tabled.

 Mr President, Madam President-in-Office of the Council, Mr President of the Commission, ladies and gentlemen, the 15 Heads of State and Government will be meeting this week for the European Council that will close the Swedish presidency of the Union, a presidency everyone agrees struck a positive note, especially in regard to transparency and citizens' access to information. This summit will also have to evaluate the unexpected results of the Irish referendum on ratifying the Treaty of Nice. We are sorry the Irish people said ‘no’ to this treaty; although far from perfect, at least it resolved the left-overs of Amsterdam and, above all, opened the way to enlargement of the European Union to other countries. So what are the Irish saying by abstaining so heavily? That all too often the citizens see Europe as some nebulous abstraction, with no bearing on their daily concerns. If there is a message in this vote, it concerns the urgent need to hold a real, popular grass-roots debate on these issues. I am confident that the Union can rise to this challenge. We hope the Treaty of Nice will enter into force before the end of the year 2002, so that the Union can welcome the new Member States in 2004, as it has undertaken to do. All the existing Member States must hasten to ratify this treaty without delay, and I am glad that by its vote in the National Assembly yesterday, France is now one of the first countries to do so. Our priority, which the Gothenburg European Council must solemnly reiterate, remains to prepare for enlargement. We will do our utmost to ensure that the post-Nice situation lives up to the European citizens’ expectations with regard to the purpose of the Union, in the light of its political project and its democratic deficit. We will say ‘yes’ to the post-Nice situation, prepared by a convention made up of the national parliaments and the European Parliament, the governments of the 15, the Commission and civil society. We will say ‘yes’ to a European constitution that reaffirms our common values, respect for human rights, cultural diversity and the social model, and that defines the respective competences of the Member States and the Union. We also say ‘yes’ to a federation of nation-states in which each state will retain its specific nature and its competences.

 Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, the European Parliament has already, on several previous occasions, adopted positions on the human rights situation in the Lao People’s Democratic Republic, in 1991 and 1997 in particular. At that time, Parliament requested the unconditional release of prisoners of conscience but this request was ignored and since then at least one of them, Mr Tchongsouk Saysangkhi, has died in prison. After 25 years of Communist rule, the people of Laos are today hoping that their country will follow the path of transition to democracy and are calling for free elections. The Laotian Government, however, continues to stamp out any peaceful demonstrations, such as the one held on 26 October 1999 and, more recently, on 17 November 2000. The organisers of the earlier demonstration were arrested and are still in prison. The leader of the second demonstration, Mr Phommachaul Phannolath, was also arrested along with other demonstrators. The resolution before the House denounces these human rights violations and reminds the Lao People’s Democratic Republic that, as a partner of the European Union through a Cooperation Agreement signed in April 1997, it undertook to promote and protect all human rights. The Lao PDR also showed its commitment to this by signing two United Nations conventions on human rights in December 2000. This commitment must henceforth be backed up with real action. Furthermore, the Lao PDR is taking on the role of coordinator of relations between the European Union and the Association of South East Asian Nations until 2002. This role gives it further responsibilities in promoting the concepts and values on which the partnership is based. I hope that Parliament will give its support to the European Union’s strategy on the region as well as to all the people of Laos who are working towards democracy and for national harmony within the country. The compromise resolution is well-balanced, clear and specific. On behalf of my group, I would urge you to support it so that the European Parliament can make its voice heard in this troubled area of the world. (Applause)

 Mr President, Mr President of the Commission, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, all my colleagues have stressed the expectations that surrounded the Nice Summit, which was intended to allow the European Union to continue operating effectively, democratically and transparently after the historic enlargement we are awaiting. Certainly, the Nice Summit has made it possible to achieve significant progress on all the issues that directly affect the lives of our citizens, whether it be the preservation of health, the protection of the environment, social policy or indeed the adoption of a European Company Statute. Another positive point is that the Charter of Fundamental Rights has been officially proclaimed, even if it is not intended to be binding at this stage. Finally, the decisions taken in the area of the common foreign and security policy represent undeniable progress. This summit would have been a triumph if the crucial revision of the Treaties had been crowned with as much success as the areas I have just mentioned. In fact, while we seem to have succeeded in avoiding total paralysis of the future enlarged European Union, it has not been possible to convert the ambitions of the French Presidency into a new draft of the Treaty. Be it the excessively limited number of areas transferred from unanimity to majority voting, or subject to codecision, be it the upward revision of the number of Members of the European Parliament in the Europe of tomorrow, or yet again, be it the uncertainty over the number of Commissioners after the enlargements, the Treaty does not come up to scratch, far from it. Beyond the technical aspects of that reform, what concerns us most of all is the growing difficulty the Member States of the European Union have in making joint decisions, in accordance with the common interests of their citizens. Let me conclude, as rapporteur for the outermost regions of the Union, by expressing deep regret at the rather disappointing conclusions of the Nice Summit, which do no more than acknowledge the Commission’s work programme. The outermost regions deserve better and Parliament will continue to work flat out – with Commissioner Barnier’s help, I am sure – to give them all the space they are entitled to within the Union.

 Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, let me first of all thank the members of the Committee on Regional Policy, Transport and Tourism whose comments and amendments have contributed towards enhancing the report which I am presenting this evening. The present and future fate of the seven European regions most remote from the continent has given our committee the opportunity to unanimously adopt a constructive and balanced document, the product of lengthy consultation. The Azores, the Canaries, Guadeloupe, French Guiana, Madeira, Martinique and Réunion form a separate category whose uniqueness has now been recognised by the Treaty of Amsterdam on the basis of an innovative concept: they are defined as ‘outermost regions’. The Treaty recognises that the outermost regions have a difficult economic and social situation, aggravated by special handicaps which, because they are continual and combined, are extremely prejudicial to development in these regions. This is the reason why it is essential to ensure the widest possible application of the current rules and to use the most appropriate instruments to solve the practical problems faced by these regions and, where necessary, derogations adapted to the regional situation, without this posing any serious threat to Community interests. The report published by the European Commission on 14 March 2000 is not, strictly speaking, a response to the demands of national and regional authorities in the outermost regions. The Commission specifies that it is unable to provide answers to all the questions; it often confines itself to proposing guidelines intended to continue and consolidate certain established instruments and further reserves the option of looking into the problems on a case by case basis. Article 299(2) primarily expresses a political will, supported on repeated occasions by the European Council and, today, by the European Parliament. The chief objective of my report was to remind the European Commission of this political will in order to put an end to the unfortunate impression of reluctance or inertia that we are currently getting from the Commission. As a matter of urgency, therefore, the staff complement of the Interdepartmental Group attached to the Commission Secretariat should be strengthened at the earliest possible opportunity in order to ensure that all proposals for acts which are general in scope are accompanied, when considered by the College of Commissioners and on the basis of Article 299(2), by a simplified sheet outlining their potential impact. My report urges the Commission to prepare a genuine multiannual work programme, accompanied by a detailed timetable, giving the most comprehensive details possible of the measures planned, and providing all the essential guarantees concerning the provision of the resources required to ensure the viability of the measures and to ensure that the measures concerned are taken on a long-term basis where they are intended to deal with intrinsic handicaps. In order to rule out any misunderstanding concerning the Commission’s reluctance to make full use of the scope afforded by Article 299(2), I propose that an enlarged forum for dialogue should meet annually and an annual report should be drawn up. In response to the Commission, my report specifically investigates a number of areas falling within the scope of activities of the European Union. I shall give just a brief overview of these this evening. The Commission has acknowledged that the agricultural and fisheries measures need to be revised or upgraded. However, this second revision of the POSEI regulations will take place in a very difficult budgetary climate which may have a major bearing on the substance of the programmes, particularly the level of aid granted. By way of example, in its draft budget for 2001, the Commission has proposed an outrageous cut in the budget for implementation of POSEI, giving rise to an acute sense of disquiet among the many agricultural producers in the outermost regions, on whose behalf I am speaking before you today. In addition, we need optimum coordination and use of all the instruments available at Community level, in particular the Structural Funds, state aid schemes and tax and customs policies. The success of the new Community policy to assist the outermost regions calls for action geared to the strategic areas of the world economy: transport, energy, the environment, the information society, research and technological development. In this way it will contribute to promoting economic and social progress thanks to an increased level of employment. The geographical situation and island status of the outermost regions must enable them to become active frontiers of the European Union. Moreover, there is an urgent need to initiate an analysis of the impact of the new ACP-EU Partnership Agreement, signed in June 2000 in Cotonou, and other international trade agreements with a view to assessing their repercussions for the outermost regions and drawing up measures to compensate producers in those regions liable to face additional competition which they are unable to withstand. To conclude, finally, with a subject that has a bearing on our immediate future, the process of enlargement is unquestionably an essential element in the construction of Europe, but an evaluation of its implications must be undertaken as a matter of urgency as of right now in order to prevent the aid duly allotted to the outermost regions and the projects resulting from the implementation of Article 299(2) being brought into question.

 Mr President, Mr President-in-Office of the Council, Mr President of the Commission, ladies and gentlemen, rarely can a Presidency of the European Union have been so burdened with challenges and chock-full of events. These challenges are, in essence, the Intergovernmental Conference and the preparation for enlargement, which are of course interconnected. The events are the problems currently being experienced by the euro, the surge in oil prices and, on a different level, the hopes for a transition towards democracy in Yugoslavia. In other words, the French Presidency's task is no easy one. We, as elected representatives, are at least as responsible for encouraging it to make progress in the face of adversity as we are for relaying the messages that we receive from public opinion in each of our countries. These are, first and foremost, messages of concern at the economic and social problems that we are experiencing, in spite of a period of sustained growth stemming from years of efforts by all our fellow citizens. During this French Presidency of the Union, we expect a firm unified response from the 15 Member States to these issues, which are of prime concern to our fellow citizens, one that will enable a rapid reversal of these trends. Should this fail to materialise, we should not be surprised if public opinion proves sceptical about Europe, or even rejects it. Then there are messages of encouragement concerning the IGC negotiations in preparation for the enlargement of the Union. These are, as we know, very tricky negotiations and raise fears of a setback or a watered-down agreement in Nice which, as you have already acknowledged, Mr Moscovici, would be even more serious. The European Parliament, and the peoples of Europe it represents, expect the extraordinary European Council Meeting in Biarritz to mark a leap forward, a political wake-up call for the Heads of State and Government. The policy of one step at a time no longer suits the scale of the challenges that confront us, but your determination on both counts is evident in your statements. Let us restore a human dimension to Europe. Incorporating the Charter of Fundamental Rights into the Treaties would be a major step in this direction. Let us, as a Europe of 15 Member States, organise ourselves in order to be able to welcome those countries who are knocking at the door into the fold under respectable conditions. Let us at last find the clarity of vision to define the borders of Europe. I started by mentioning the events in Yugoslavia. If only we could draw from the courage and perseverance in adversity shown by our friends in Serbia, Europe would be able to make better headway and be more readily understood and supported by its citizens.

Madam President, President of the Commission, ladies and gentlemen, it is an honour for me, as president of the French delegation within the PPE-DE Group, to take the floor on the day that the French Presidency of the European Union presented its priorities. In his speech last week in the Reichstag in Berlin, which was universally recognised as historic, the President-in-Office of the Council opened up new perspectives for the French Presidency, and also, I hope, for the presidencies which are to follow. He not only asked the real questions as to why we should build Europe, who should be involved, and how it should be done, he also provided answers key to the future of a European Union embarking on an unprecedented enlargement. To those who prefer to focus only on the short-term but certainly essential reforms that are awaiting the French Presidency and that must result in the future Treaty of Nice next December, I shall respond that these major reforms will only be achieved successfully if they are guided not only by modern European history, but also by an ambitious and realistic vision of what the Europe of tomorrow must be – a strong, democratic and free Europe that carries some weight in the eyes of the world. We all know that in order to meet the considerable challenges which Europe faces today, we shall together have to work out how to clearly define our plan for Europe, all together. We must be grateful to the President-in-Office of the Council for having had both the courage and boldness to encourage our partners to engage in discussions but also to suggest the guidelines for these. Our fellow citizens await a Europe which at last has the determination to review its modus operandi and to strive to achieve greater clarity, greater transparency and greater efficiency. The reforms of the Commission and the Council must respond to these requirements. We must keep in mind that, even if it is not an easy task, France and its partners are under an obligation to achieve results. We must reach an agreement, and a good one at that. Far from clouding the issue, today’s debate has offered some clarification as to the direction of the action to be undertaken in the months and years to come, which I shall sum up as follows: bringing Europe closer to the citizens, all the citizens without exception, be they close to the decision-making centres or remote, economic modernisation and a social Europe, efficiency and a strong presence in the world. I have every confidence in Jacques Chirac, President-in-Office of the Council, and in his ability, along with our partners within the European Union, to meet these historic challenges. (Applause)

) President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, this Sixth Periodic Report on the social and economic situation of the regions of the Union, which was adopted last year by the Commission, indicated that the 25 richest regions of the European Union still had an average GDP per head that was two and a half times higher than that in the 25 poorest regions, and my fellow Members have also reminded us of this. The development gap between the Member States has certainly been reduced, but there are still disparities between the regions, not only with regard to the GDP per head, but also, particularly, in terms of unemployment. Despite the economic upturn, the unemployment rate in the Union as a whole stood at around 10% at the end of 1998. Moreover, the distribution of unemployment is extremely uneven. Whereas the 25 regions least affected are experiencing a relative stabilisation of the rate at around 3 or 4%, the trend has not been reversed in the 25 worst affected regions, with a rate which is still higher than 20%. In its 1998Annual Report on the Structural Funds, the Commission notes, rightly so, that high regional unemployment leads to social exclusion, hence making unemployment even more resistant to economic improvement. An integrated strategy combining measures to boost the economic base of the regions and measures to improve access to the job market, particularly through training, is essential if this situation is to be resolved. It therefore seems to me that structural actions must continue to step up their efficacy and impact in terms of job creation in order to sustain the current economic growth, especially in the regions most affected by unemployment. Furthermore, the work carried out under the European Spatial Development Perspective follows the development of the organisation of the European territory from a traditional, rather centralised model, towards a polycentric model which is the only way to promote a more balanced geographical distribution of work in Europe. The Commission has promised that the emphasis in the new programming period for the Structural Funds will be on improving transport networks, particularly in the peripheral or outermost regions, and on creating sustainable and effective transport systems that provide a balance between the different modes of transport. I must stress particularly that the priority objective of this increased coordination should be to reduce structural divergences between the central part of the Union and the peripheral and outermost regions, as specified in one of the amendments adopted by my committee.

 Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, the Commission’s report states that 1998 saw the consolidation of the trans-European networks and outlines the progress made with various projects in the area of transport, energy and tele- and data communications. It must, however, be pointed out that the European Union’s budgetary resources fall considerably short of the requirements and the challenge generated by the establishment of a trans-European transport network. Unless there is an increase in the financial contribution made by national, regional and local public bodies and by the private sector, we will not see any significant progress in this area in the foreseeable future. I should nevertheless like to stress the fact that recourse to private finance should never be an obstacle to the development of communications in regions which currently have a per capita income well below the Community average. With regard to the future review of the guidelines for trans-European transport networks, I feel I must once again draw the Commission’s attention to the need to attach greater importance to improving access to Europe’s remote and isolated regions, and to focus particularly on establishing sustainable transport networks. The impact of such investments on the economy of these regions and on employment is a crucial factor in the socio-economic development of these regions. The Commission’s work programme for the year 2000 lays down that the review of the guidelines for trans-European transport networks must concentrate on reducing bottlenecks in order to rationalise traffic in Europe and to make it flow more freely. As I understand it, this amounts to saying that the review currently being prepared will mainly concern the central regions of the European Union, which are the main victims of these congestion problems. I can only hope that this hypothesis does not mean that the remote and, to an even greater extent, the extremely remote regions might only be incidentally affected by this review. This fear, which has been mentioned several times by many of my colleagues, led me to table an amendment to this effect, which was adopted by the Committee on Regional Policy, Transport and Tourism and which features in Mr Hatzidakis’s excellent report. I would be most grateful to you, Commissioner, if, today, you could allay my concerns.

Mr President, Commissioner, I should like to start by thanking Mr Viceconte for his report, which has drawn our attention to a sector which is all too often underestimated. Tourism is a social, economic and cultural phenomenon which affects most European citizens, either as the recipients or the providers of a wide variety of services. Every year, nearly 200 million Europeans leave their homes for a short time in order to travel, usually to other countries in Europe. Moreover, Europe is still the main destination for tourists from third countries, even though it faces increasingly stiff competition and an increasingly diversified and attractive range of products. Since the Treaties contain no specific legal basis for a real Community tourism policy, the European Union must help to improve and encourage cooperation in this sector, in accordance with the principle of subsidiarity, in order to take practical advantage of the potential which tourism offers in terms of employment. Vocational training and a mobile workforce are important tools in the strategy to fight unemployment in Europe especially, as far as tourist service providers are concerned, in meeting multicultural demands and ensuring that services are tailored to customers. Employment in the tourism sector is often highly seasonal and precarious, thereby hampering its sustainable development. It is therefore even more urgent that we acquire and disseminate managerial and technological skills in order to promote new means of production and a supply of tourism which reflects market developments as closely as possible. As the report notes, the adoption by the Member States of tax incentives for SMEs in order to reduce labour costs would be an excellent way of promoting growth in employment in labour-intensive sectors and, consequently, in the tourism sector. This sector of activity is also a deciding factor in the economic and social development of less favoured regions, especially the most remote and island regions, which have undisputed assets in this area. Let us not forget that, in the most remote regions, tourism is the most important industry in terms of income. The income and employment generated by tourism help enormously in reducing imbalances and encouraging their economies to converge with the average rate of growth in the Community. In addition, tourism can promote a certain cultural and economic rapprochement, insofar as it makes us more aware of other European cultures and thus helps respect for European ways of life to develop. It goes without saying, therefore, that tourism, developed rationally in the long term, should represent a sustainable source of income for local economies, while safeguarding and enhancing the value of the rural, cultural, historical and environmental heritage. I should like to close by stressing the essential role which the European Union should play in promoting new forms of tourism in new places which will allow continental Europeans to discover the most far-flung destinations in Europe, namely the most remote regions.

 Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, I shall confine my observations to Mr Decourrière’s report. The INTERREG Community Initiative Programme is an extremely important tool in terms of the development and regional planning of European territory, most particularly with reference to effectively taking into account the relationship between the centre of the European Union and its outlying regions.
 INTERREG must, therefore, be an instrument promoting territorial cohesion throughout the Union if we do not wish to see a two– or even three-speed European territory. It is obvious to me that the regional and local authorities, and their representative bodies, the Committee of the Regions and, of course, the European Parliament should have been involved in the clearest way possible and at the earliest possible opportunity framing this programme. Indeed, I am forced to observe that this was not the case when the Commission drew up its communication, published on 13 October last year.
 Even though I approve of the general guidelines of INTERREG III, I feel it is extremely important to ensure better coordination between this programme, financed by the ERDF, and the other external cooperation funds, including in particular the European Development Fund, intended for ACP countries. In this connection, I should like to thank the Committee on Regional Policy, Transport and Tourism for adopting one of my amendments adding the EDF to the list of these funds.
 The most remote regions, particularly the four French overseas departments, must be able to coordinate INTERREG III and the EDF in order to fund, in turn, cooperation projects with their ACP neighbours in their respective geographical areas. Furthermore, I would ask the Commission to please reconsider the limited opportunities that have been offered to the most remote and island regions according to the guidelines put forward in the communication. It is essential for these regions to be able to benefit fully from INTERREG III, just like all the other regions in the Union, especially now that the REGIS programme dedicated to such isolated regions has been dropped. Finally, in conclusion, I would like to express my regret at the low level of funding allocated to strand C, for interregional cooperation, even though the added value this offers the Community is undeniable.

 Mr President, Commissioner, this sixth periodic report on the social and economic situation and development of the regions of the European Union constitutes a milestone in the analysis of regional data and highlights the progress made in this area since the issue of the fifth periodic report. I consider, however, that the mention of any real convergence of average regional development levels in Europe offers a somewhat over-simplified view of the situation and, unfortunately, this is often the message taken up in the press and in some speeches. The Commission report generally relativises this observation, particularly when it refers to the social and economic situation of some regions of the Union in which I have a special interest, by which I mean the French overseas departments and, more generally, the most remote regions. In this respect, I am pleased to see that the Committee on Regional Policy, Transport and Tourism has adopted one of my amendments calling on the Commission to devote a specific chapter in its next report on cohesion to the special case of the most remote regions and, more specifically, to consideration of the impact of the measures shortly to be adopted under new Article 299(2) of the Treaty of Amsterdam. Finally, in my view, this sixth periodic report presents interesting arguments from the viewpoint of a real project for the balanced sustainable development of Europe, particularly when it outlines the importance of relations between the central areas of Europe and its more remote regions. Even if the Commission is still reluctant to say so in too explicit a fashion, its periodic report demonstrates the urgent need to promote polycentric development of the Community area through the Union’s structural policies and within the scope of the approach initiated by the SEC.

 Employment results today constitute a key element of the principal objective of Lisbon, set in 2000. As you surely know, this objective is the following. I quote: ‘making the European Union the most competitive and dynamic knowledge-based economy in the world, capable of sustainable economic growth with more and better jobs and greater social cohesion’. We must not forget that Europe has already made considerable progress as we have created six million jobs on the European continent since 1999. That being the case, it is clear that, despite this progress, Europe will not reach the intermediary quantitative objective: to reach an employment rate of 67% by 2005. Today, a major French newspaper used the headline ‘Europe’s growth at a standstill’, growth that will only reach 1.7%. This is the reason why, faced with the observation that the economy is slowing down, we must bring everything into play, and it is the duty of the European Union to react. It is in this context that Mr Wim Kok’s report was produced. This report stressed that there was an urgent need for practical action, by putting in place some decisive measures on a fiscal, social, environmental, research and innovation level in order particularly, in all areas, to create jobs, taking into account, of course, globalisation and the problems linked to the ageing of the population. This requires to a great extent a rapid reaction and good management of the change. This is why we have a duty to choose this change in order not to be subjected to it. This is why, in my report, I wished to insist on the practical implementation of the employment guidelines. Firstly, it is advisable to improve the reaction capacity of businesses and their employees. This requires an adaptation through an increase in levels of human capital and a policy of life-long training, which should be encouraged. This also requires active encouragement of the creation of businesses, particularly small businesses. It is in this spirit (this is the subject of Amendment 7 of the report) that Europe must support networks and partnerships, for example platforms of excellence that link small businesses, research centres, universities and private businesses. Secondly, there is cause to mobilise the working population, indeed the entire population. In this spirit, I recommend (this is the subject of Amendment 5) making the employment of young people a great European cause. Thirdly, it is advisable to launch a huge European plan against de-industrialisation. In this spirit (this is the subject of Amendment 6), it is certainly important that the European Union support the most disadvantaged regions without neglecting the development of the most dynamic areas. This is the subject of Amendment 5. Fourthly, very specific guidance, intended to improve governance. This is, in fact, the conclusion of the Wim Kok report. Improved governance, meaning the need to mobilise all of the players – national parliaments, regional and local players, social partners, trade unions and associations, but also businesses – and also to facilitate, in this spirit, improved access to the structural funds. Until now, Europe has supported the policies of the Member States, but in a spirit of assistance, by adopting a policy of what I would like to call assistance in the form of a crutch, but not in a spirit of economic dynamism. I think that if it is advisable to keep in mind the need to support the most disadvantaged regions, Europe must both show overtly, and demonstrate, to the outside world its ability to be dynamic. Community financing policy must be established in this spirit of economic dynamism. This is very specifically what I would like to say. Furthermore, Mr President, I am sorry that, following the votes that took place yesterday, which were on such important issues as the environmental life cycle, tyres, marmalades and sweetened chestnut purée – all votes of great consequence – we are obliged to discuss employment policy now, and, moreover, without the Council. I am sorry about the conditions under which we have had to produce this report, given the ambiguity that surrounds it. Indeed, you are producing a report on the guidelines, a legislative report, but you cannot amend it because the guidelines have been fixed for the past three years, as if the environmental context, the international, sociological, financial and fiscal context of this matter, were not changing.

The aim of Regulation No 1408/71 is to ensure the coordination of the Member States’ social security systems in order to protect the rights of persons moving within the European Union. That is why this regulation is essential, and why its adoption today is necessary. Indeed, I must remind you that the free movement of workers is one of the four freedoms laid down in the Treaty of Rome. Over many years – since 1971 to be precise – this regulation has been amended considerably in order to take as much account as possible of changes in national legislation, to improve certain provisions and to fill the gaps that still exist. Following a great deal of negotiation in the Council and some effective work by our rapporteur, we have achieved a satisfactory balance, taking into account the constraints and characteristics of the Member States’ various social security systems. True, the text could be improved. Nevertheless, it forms without any doubt whatsoever, an important step forward as regards the free movement of citizens. They will now be able to retain their rights to social security when they go to work in another Member State. In addition, their families will also benefit from full health cover. It is for all these reasons, and in particular because of the essential and tangible improvement in the daily lives of our fellow citizens, that I am voting in favour of this report.

 Madam President, on behalf of the French MEPs, I should like, in my turn, to offer our condolences to the Spanish Government, to our fellow MEPs and to yourself, Commissioner. I turn now to the document submitted to us. Allow me first of all to congratulate the rapporteur who, on a sensitive subject, has succeeded in preparing a document that is balanced and, I think, satisfactory to employed persons, self-employed persons and members of their families. This document will enable the current system to be updated in a very positive way and, as the rapporteur said, will put an end to the differing interpretations at national level, while making it easier for our fellow citizens to move about. Moreover, it is based upon the decisions of the Court of Justice, defining the non-exportable character of certain benefits. The latter have three characteristics: their specificity, their non-contributory character and the fact that they are in line with each country’s level of income. I understand the position of our Dutch fellow MEPs where a number of the benefits are concerned. It has to be understood, however, that, in a system of social benefits, there are, on the one hand, what are termed legal benefits, having to do with retirement and sickness and, on the other hand, benefits of another type, termed non-contributory and referred to in France as optional benefits. All countries have benefits of this type. When I was responsible for social matters in France, I created what was termed a parental presence benefit. For families suddenly finding themselves with a disabled child, we created, in Paris, a benefit in the region of EUR 500 per month for 12 months. This benefit is now non-contributory and does not meet the criteria of exportability, meaning that, if a family with a disabled child goes tomorrow to Belgium or Spain where they are not granted a benefit of the same type, they will be hit very badly. That is why we must support Mrs Gillig’s report. In a certain number of cases not exclusively concerning our Dutch friends, we must also come up with bilateral solutions, for this issue has to do not only with freedom of movement and, therefore, greater intelligibility but also with social justice. That is why we must support the rapporteur’s amendment and why, Commissioner, we must also be able to benefit from your support. Indeed, you will appreciate that, for our fellow citizens, it is social justice that is at stake today.

 Mr President, the aim of the report on which we are about to vote is to strengthen legislation governing the situation of women in the EU. Such legislation has an enormous impact, in terms of ensuring that the fundamental rights of women are upheld and women are encouraged to achieve their full potential. This must apply not only to women but also to families, children and, consequently, to the future of our European societies. While it is true, as Mrs Fraisse has just stated, that significant progress has been made in terms of reducing disparities, much remains to be done if we are to achieve the objectives set by the EU in this area. I should like to mention two significant commitments made in Lisbon: to reach a 60% employment rate among women in the EU by 2010; and to ensure that by 2010 at least 90% of children between three years old and mandatory school age are provided with proper child care. In this regard, I deplore the fact that we do not have a common social policy, the absence of which results in delays, which are sometimes substantial, in adopting certain directive proposals. I refer, inter alia, to those based on Article 13 of the Treaty of Amsterdam, which could prohibit for the first time any act of discrimination based on gender outside the job market, such as access to goods and services or the supply of these. We, consequently, have no hesitation in endorsing Mrs Bastos’s excellent report, which would enable us to take the measures needed to ensure reconciliation of professional and family life. It therefore appears that we could introduce a directive, as we did for parental leave, in the next few years. In actual fact, whereas the concept of reconciling family and professional life has been around at European level for some time, this has not always been the case in practice, especially among companies, who often disregard this issue. I therefore believe, Mr President, that we must support Mrs Bastos’s report. I should like to add that today we are fulfilling a dream, since certain Members who have sat in this House for some time are aware that the words ‘family’ and ‘child’, along with the concept of reconciling working life and family life, were taboo in this House ten years ago. We must rejoice in this debate held today on this 8 March.

 The next Spring European Council will hinge on two key documents published in recent months: the Commission’s Joint Employment Report and the report by the Employment Task Force that is mentioned in paragraph 19 of the current resolution. The resolution was presented by our political group and others, and I totally support it. These two documents state that a more determined and active implementation of the Lisbon Agenda and the European Employment Strategy is essential to strengthen an economic recovery in Europe. The six million jobs created since 1999 prove that we must continue down this route. As Mr Wim Kok pointed out, partnerships at all levels, as well as governance must, however, be improved, in order to ensure that the reforms are implemented still more effectively. The acceleration of technical innovations and globalisation of trade make it essential for all Europeans and all policies to be mobilised. As rapporteur for the Committee on Employment and Social Affairs on the 2004 Employment Guidelines, I hope to see a growth trend emerge in Europe, as well as a culture of economic development. Community funding aimed at supporting the creation of employment, in particular through the European Social Fund, needs to be made clearer in the eyes of our citizens so that the European Union will appear as the ‘bearer of projects’.

 Mr President, I would like to stress the importance of the text on which we are going to vote on the revision of the directive on the organisation of working time, which, as Mr Pronk stressed, Commissioner, ought to have taken place by 23 November 2003. It is because we have waited for too long that we find ourselves in this situation. Recently, President Prodi presented to us a document entitled ‘Delivering Lisbon’. We cannot deny that, to make Europe the most dynamic economic power in the world, we need to have policies that perform to help businesses adapt to new production conditions and to ever-increasing economic competition whilst taking into account the safety and health of workers. This is why, in order to adapt to the realities of the market, we need to evolve in a relatively flexible framework. Given this, organisation of working time is dependent on a number of factors and on the characteristics of the sector of activity concerned and of the profession in question. It is on that basis, for example, that we have already legislated for mobile workers in the transport sector, but we have recognised and accepted the concept of flexibility for people driving goods vehicles over 3.5 tonnes. We also have a certain number of problems as regards homeworkers and also those working in situations that involve caring for others, because private and professional life are often intermingled in this area. That is the first point. The second point is that, in addition to these differences according to sectors, we must draw attention to the specific characteristics of national industrial relations systems. Some Member States call on collective or workforce agreements to establish the average working time, whilst others resort to individual derogations which make it possible for workers in, for example, supervisory positions, not to be subjected to restrictions in working time. I do, of course, agree with the fact that the European Union is duty bound to lay down minimum conditions governing the organisation of working time in order to guarantee a high level of health and safety protection for workers. Should it not at the same time, though, give enterprises the option of reacting contrary to general practice when faced with different constraints? This is why it seems to me that the rapporteur’s opinion would have to be qualified by accepting, for example, as you initially proposed, Commissioner, the gradual abolition of the opt out, provided for in Article 18 of the Directive, in return for the introduction, in the future draft revision of the directive, of a derogation at Article 6 to allow periods of inactivity partially to be taken into account. This would probably be a transitional solution that would make it possible to have minimal social rules whilst, at the same time, taking into account the constraints of each sector.

 Mr President, I would like first to thank Mr Moraes, who has managed to address such sensitive issues as immigration and integration by drawing up what is, over all, a satisfactory report. In view of the new demographic challenges that the European Union will have to confront in a few years’ time, the Commission and the rapporteur are right to present immigration as part, but only part, of the answer for Europe. In view of the economic and social consequences of the ageing of the population, it is clear today that managed immigration will without a doubt avoid a slowing down in economic growth and a decline in our fellow citizens’ quality of life. However, I doubt that such managed immigration can take place, because obviously everyone aspires to a change of scenery and a better standard of living. Moreover, we sometimes encourage such flows by our votes; I am thinking in particular of Mrs Lambert’s report, report 1481, which extends our entire social security system to refugees and immigrants. That being the case, we need a number of measures to facilitate and improve the reception and integration of aliens without penalising either the host country or the aliens who are moving lawfully on the territory of the European Union. One of the necessary conditions for successful integration is that immigrants should have access to the European Union’s employment market and we are all agreed on that. It seems to me premature, however, in the context of a report on employment and integration, to give third country nationals the right to vote in local and European elections. As my fellow Member, the chairman of the Committee on Citizens’ Freedoms and Rights, Justice and Home Affairs, said, how can we imagine third country nationals voting in European elections when they do not have the right to vote in general elections in our countries? As for local elections, each of the Union’s 15 countries currently has its own practice in the matter of voting rights – nationality based on parentage or place of birth – and it is unthinkable today to imagine that the same legislation could be applied to all 15 countries of the Union by a vote taken so stealthily. That is why I shall be voting for Amendment No 4, which notes that third country nationals have the right to vote in local elections in some countries but does not oblige the other Member States to do the same.

 Four years of reduced rates of VAT do not allow us to see the complete effects of this experiment; all the more since, knowing that it was temporary, some employers did not implement it. All the industries consulted, however, claim that lowering VAT has positive economic effects that are by no means insignificant. In this way, the number of wage earners working in the housing maintenance sector has increased in France by 8.6% in two years. This is why we need to continue down this route. As draftsman, I can only welcome the Commission text and, in particular, Annex H, extending Annex K to some services, such as catering. Since each Member State freely chooses to apply a reduced rate in a category appearing in Annex H, all sectors that benefited from the experiment must not now be excluded from the scope of the directive. This is why I voted in favour of the amendments by the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs. Furthermore, Amendments Nos 22 and 23 that I tabled with Astrid Lulling for the part-session are extremely important; indeed they allow for the experiment to be extended until the current changes to the directive come into force, which is absolutely necessary in order to avoid disastrous consequences in terms of jobs.

 Mr President, Europe has a duty to continually step up its efforts to establish a harmonised judicial area, in particular for the benefit of the weakest members of society. It is against this background that today's debate on parental responsibility is taking place. Parliament was consulted on this proposal for a Council decision at very short notice – as you reminded us, Commissioner – but the importance of the debate and the issues involved meant that it was willing to comply. I believe that we cannot do other than welcome this proposal, because this debate on parental responsibility is the consequence, dare I say it, of the political determination of a number of Members of this Parliament – foremost among them my colleague Mrs Banotti – who have been campaigning since 1994 for Parliament to take into account the child's best interests and the rights of the child. Although the Hague Convention of 1996 is a traditional legal instrument within private international law, it has already been a significant source of inspiration for those drafting the new regulation on parental responsibility. We already know that on 3 October, the Ministers of Justice of our respective countries adopted this new regulation, which should make it possible to avoid those interminable legal battles that are so detrimental to children. This new text also extends the scope of Brussels II to all decisions relating to child custody, which should be welcomed given that in many countries, in particular France and Germany, divorces and separations between couples from two different countries are still giving rise to substantial conflict. It will also mean that one single text will determine the judge competent to rule on a divorce or on issues affecting children. It is therefore a step in the right direction. Nevertheless, we should not forget that the thorny issue of parental responsibility also arises outside the European Union with regard to third countries. That is also why, in the same spirit, I support the Commission's proposal to authorise the Member States to accede to the Hague Convention. I am convinced that this Convention can make a valuable contribution to strengthening Community legislation on child protection in cases that go beyond the borders of the European Community. I would draw your attention to the fact that the overlap between the scopes of the Convention and the new regulation will, I am sure, make it easier to apply these two instruments in parallel. As you will have seen, given the rather procedural nature of the Commission's proposal, I have not tabled many amendments. I do not think that Parliament has had cause to object to the content of the proposal. It is an exceptional procedure, as I have underlined in my report, given that the Hague Convention stipulates that only sovereign states can be parties to it. This illustrates the importance of Parliament's role, because a parliamentary opinion is required for the Member States to accede to the Hague Convention. Commissioner, I have stressed the timetable. The Commission had proposed a very long deadline: 1 March 2005. That is why I have tabled an amendment proposing to bring this date forward by six months, to 30 June 2004. I do not think that you will have anything against this, particularly given that it is in the interests of the children. I have also tabled two further amendments, one of which refers to the Charter of Fundamental Rights and the other to the work of the European Convention. You will be aware that in the first part of the draft constitution, Articles 3 and 4 provide that the Union shall combat exclusion and discrimination and provide social justice and protection, equality between women and men, solidarity between generations and protection of children's rights. It is in this spirit that I have proposed this amendment. Commissioner, we all know that enacting rules on the subject is not enough and we must not simply see this as an empty gesture, because we constantly need to follow up specific cases that are submitted to us. It is therefore essential to ensure that the rules are properly applied, but, given that it is up to the Member States, who remain sovereign in this field, to do this, the European Parliament will always have to ensure that, in accordance with the recent conclusions of the UN World Summit for Children, the child's best interests remain a prime concern, not only in all judicial decisions relating to children, but also in all of the decisions made by our Parliament.

 I would like to start by stressing the need for a regular report of this kind and the importance thereof so that we can constantly improve the situation of the fundamental rights of the European citizens. It is essential that we develop strategies promoting equal access for all to fundamental rights such as education, healthcare and culture and to a permanent job and housing. Europe is more than just a geographical and historical entity with expanding borders. It is, first and foremost, a community of people bound by shared values which has been shaped over the course of time by its political, economic and spiritual history. I do not feel that the report reflects or upholds certain values of our European civilisation. I believe that imposing a particular set of moral values on the entire European Union is contrary to the principle of respect for diversity, which is, moreover, enshrined at the very heart of European integration and in the Charter of Fundamental Rights. Local cultures and different ways of living must not be destabilised. Each of our countries has its own history and perspective, which are, of course, different, having been shaped by countless different experiences. We owe it to ourselves to respect them, for our cultural and religious diversity enriches us. (Written declaration abbreviated in accordance with Article 120(7) of the Rules of Procedure)

 Madam President, freedom of movement is one of the four fundamental freedoms set out in our Treaties. Ensuring that persons moving within the EU do not suffer disadvantages in their social security rights and consequently coordinating national social security legislation is, therefore, a crucial element, as a number of my fellow Members have said. I am thus convinced that social security systems that function harmoniously and in a coordinated way are valuable assets for European societies. Acquired rights, the policy of simplifying pre-retirement benefits, clarification of sickness benefits, the assets that our colleagues have suggested in the field of handicaps, are the basic building blocks for improving this report, which addresses in particular the social protection of frontier workers and of those who move around within our territory. Even if those only represent a small percentage of the population as a whole, the problems that they face clearly warrant our full attention. On this matter, I have a specific example in mind: I remember inviting to Paris some Belgian doctors, who had practised in their country for 20 years. When they arrived at the social security office in Paris, they were told they had lost their rights. This shows that we must welcome this text. Nevertheless, some of the amendments contained in this report appear to be somewhat problematic. I am thinking in particular of Amendment No 3 and of extending the regulation’s scope, which I do not feel would be appropriate given the potential financial impact of such a measure. As for Amendment No 20, I believe it disrupts the balance of the regulation for no good reason. This is why I believe that Parliament must be reasonable and accept Amendment No 49, as Mrs Oomen-Ruijten suggested a short while ago in her speech.

 I would first like to thank Mrs Lynne for her report. It underlines the need to establish international legally-binding instruments to provide better protection of the rights of disabled people. This is an appropriate moment to point out that Member States are not making sufficient efforts to ensure that disabled people enjoy the same rights as non-disabled people. Essentially, what is at issue are the so-called access rights: rights to access a job, buildings, email and the Internet. These rights may exist on paper, but they are not a reality. Present European Union legislation on discrimination against disabled people only relates to employment. Discrimination, however, occurs in all areas of people’s daily lives. It follows that we must adopt a horizontal approach and integrate this factor into all political domains. The European Year of People with Disabilities is in full swing. It should mark the start of lasting change for our so-called invisible citizens. Its success will be measured in tangible results. These include increasing the public profile of disabled people and establishing more comprehensive measures to combat discrimination. We would like the Commission to enter into a firm undertaking in relation to disabled people. (Written statement abbreviated in accordance with Rule 120(7) of the Rules of Procedure).

 Mr President, it is true that thousands of women and children are battered every year. All of us in France have been shocked by the Trintignant affair this summer, but similar incidents happen on a daily basis. Again in France, a recent news item told how a father stabbed his two children to death. The children were two and three years of age. This story sends a cold shiver down the spine. It highlights the importance of the DAPHNE II Programme. I would like to point out in this regard, Mr President, that it is a matter of regret that the Conference of Presidents decided to programme debates on disability and violence against children at such a late hour. These are issues of great importance and deserve the full attention of all Members of the house. No one would dispute the importance of DAPHNE II. The programme is today widely recognised as an important instrument in combating violence. It also serves as a model of good practice at a European level. Nevertheless, it seems it was conceived initially to bring European added value by complementing measures implemented at a national level. The DAPHNE I Programme will conclude at the end of this year. It has emerged, however, that it was only possible to select 13% of the projects eligible under DAPHNE I. This was because of the increasing number of proposed projects to combat violence. Accordingly, Commissioner, in future I believe we need to target the categories of people who may be concerned more effectively. Greater openness and flexibility may be called for at times. Clearly, all types of violence merit being included within the scope of this text, especially when those most vulnerable are affected. Today, we are talking about children. Tomorrow, it could be old or disabled people. The amendments tabled draw our attention to the importance of prevention and of raising public awareness. They also suggest a need to collate precise statistics in order to assess the extent of the violence. I do not wish to reiterate what my fellow Members have said about the need for appropriate financial arrangements. I also support Amendment No 39, tabled by Mrs Lulling. It highlights the need to provide a support service to help the NGOs in the new Member States to develop their own projects, given that they have not previously benefited from this community funding.

Mr President, I would like to extend a greeting, like you, to those of our male colleagues who are in the Chamber because, as Mr Mussa said, the disease in question does indeed affect men as well. When it affects us, it affects our spouses, families and children. Moreover, the psychological climate surrounding this disease is not without impact on the lives of those around us. Although, as the rapporteur stresses, it is difficult to compare the available data in the absence of uniform standards, they do show that breast cancer incidence fluctuates from one country of the European Union to another. As already mentioned, then, the disease is one of the main causes of death for women between the ages of 35 and 55, which is why it is essential to define early detection and overall care of patients as European priorities. That is what Mrs Jöns’ report makes clear to us. It recommends the implementation of detection campaigns carried out in multidisciplinary clinics (this is very, very important), providing medical care if necessary, of course, but also psychological and social care, delivered before and after treatment by highly-trained staff. This can sometimes be another great asset in treating the illness. In France, a cancer steering committee published a report in January 2003, which has very recently allowed the President of the Republic to draw up a national plan for an anti-cancer campaign. The French report bears remarkable similarities to your own, in terms both of its findings and the objectives it proposes. Taking into account the physical and psychological stress caused by breast cancer treatments, and in order to ensure the best possible quality of life for women, it is essential to act pre-emptively, through suitable information and prevention policies, to encourage women of all ages to undergo regular screening. For this reason, we can only agree that there is a need to coordinate national policies, pursue the development of European mammography guidelines, intensify research, review the problem of gene patenting by the European Patents Office and establish registers other than the national ones currently in existence. Mrs Jöns’ report, as adopted by the Committee on Women’s Rights and Equal Opportunities, seems to respond to these objectives. That is why the Group of the European People’s Party (Christian Democrats) and European Democrats has decided to vote for the motion, for I have to say that it shows a certain amount of courage. Furthermore, since we are lucky enough to have a woman Commissioner here today, and since we know that the fifth framework programme has set aside EUR 400 million, why not make cancer a major priority in Europe from 2004, Commissioner? That would be a proactive response to Mrs Jöns’ call for a conference.

 Commissioner, we can only welcome this text and thank Mrs Gillig for the work that she has done. Let us take one very simple point of reference: child labour. In a recent report by the ILO, it is estimated that 245 million children are involved in economic activity throughout the world, of which 180 million perform the worst forms of labour, in other words, labour that puts their physical and mental health or their morality at risk. This shows how important it is to reflect on core standards. However, at a time when we are advocating a European social model, we must consider our own standards because we must not forget, once again taking the point of reference of child labour, that the number of children working in developed countries is estimated to be 2.5 million and, although all the fifteen Member States have now ratified ILO Conventions 182 and 138 on the worst forms of labour, this situation, Commissioner, is only very recent and, moreover, the conventions have not yet been ratified by all the candidate countries. In the developing countries, 10 million children work in export-related activities; they work, therefore, albeit indirectly, for multinational companies. The vast majority of children, however, are involved in labour connected to the undeclared economy, which makes it extremely difficult to monitor. This is why our group is calling for the core labour standards to be integrated into the Union’s development policy, in order to provide a clearer definition of targeted measures in the context of development cooperation programmes and to promote coordinated aid. It is from this perspective that we have drafted a number of amendments and we hope that the House will support the proposals by the Group of the European People’s Party in this area.

Mr President, the proposal presented to us by the Commission today pursues a twofold objective: it is designed on the one hand to ensure that racist and xenophobic behaviour is effectively punishable in every Member State and on the other hand to increase cooperation between national judicial authorities in cases relating to such offences. This is a timely proposal, Commissioner, given the political context with which we are familiar in a number of Member States. As a matter of fact, in its latest report, covering the year 2000, the European Monitoring Centre for Racism and Xenophobia notes that a substantial rise in the level of racial violence and in the incidence of anti-Semitic attacks and racially motivated threats and intimidation was recorded in France, Germany, Spain, Sweden and the United Kingdom. In Germany, the report says, the proportion of racist crimes increased by 33% from 1999 to 2000, while in the United Kingdom the number of racially motivated acts of violence and aggression doubled in the course of the same period. These figures should cause us concern, just as the recent election results in France have done. Moreover, it is to be feared that the international situation will lead to a resurgence of such acts. The European People’s Party therefore welcomes the proposal for a framework decision on the fight against racism and xenophobia while suggesting amendments which, we believe, will clarify the decision and make it easier to apply. I should like to emphasise the need to give the Member States a broad margin of discretion in the application and implementation of the decision, in accordance with the subsidiarity principle, and in particular the need to specify that the decision does not prevent any Member State from adopting or maintaining provisions of national criminal law that prescribe a higher degree of protection against racism and xenophobia. In addition, we support the amendments tabled on the initiative of my fellow Member, Klaus-Heiner Lehne, which define the scope of the decision, indicating clearly that it applies both to offences committed in a Member State and to those committed elsewhere if the offender is a national of a Member State. Lastly, I also consider it important to point out that the aggravating circumstances in which maximum sentences may be increased ought to be extended to cases where the victim is a minor or where the offensive words or actions have been addressed to a minor or to a person who may be easily influenced. Let me add that my group will support Amendment No 12 but not Amendments Nos 24 and 25. Thank you for your attention, and thank you, Commissioner, for having brought this very important legal and indeed political issue before Parliament.

 Ladies and gentlemen, it is not a case of barbarians on one side and civilised people on the other, of reactionaries on one side and progressives on the other, of the moral on one side and the immoral on the other. The debate should proceed in an atmosphere of mutual respect, and on that score we should thank both Mrs Van Lancker and the shadow rapporteur from our Group, Mrs Müller, for the way in which they have worked together. The fact remains, however, that this debate is out of time. Even Mrs Van Lancker recognises this in her report, and I quote, ‘... the legal or regulatory policy concerning reproductive health falls within the Member States’ sphere of competence’. The proposed resolution that we are discussing today, no doubt authorised, wrongly, by Parliament’s Bureau in the context of our institution’s right to take the initiative, does not seem to me to be well-founded. It seems to be even less well-founded if we remember that just one month ago – and we really are being paradoxical here – we voted in favour of the Lamassoure report on the division of competencies into what falls within the remit of the Community and what is the responsibility of the Member States, and we should apply what we voted for to ourselves. That is the first reason why I shall not be voting in favour of this report. My second reason is that I do not know how we can impose standards in every area. There are a certain number of cultural differences, but what is a good standard? Let me give you an example. In France, we have introduced legislation governing the morning-after pill. Suppose we were to take French legislation as our basis. It is entirely unsatisfactory. Why is that? It is because at the present time the morning-after pill is authorised in France and is distributed exclusively in schools. It cannot be authorised in hospitals. Yet schools operate for 150 days out of 365. Shall we take other legislation as our basis? We shall still find that there is something missing from the framework. What, then, is the framework for good practice? The third point, which really concerns me, is that I believe that at the present time, the combination of the recommended longer period during which abortion will be allowed and the progress being made in science which means that potential anomalies in unborn children can be diagnosed increasingly early, plus the progress being made in bio-ethics, carries with it a risk. A certain number of doctors, and by no means the least progressive – I am thinking, in the case of France, for example, of Professor Nisand – would agree with me on this point, and the risk is that this combination of circumstances might lead, tomorrow, either directly or indirectly, somewhere, to a system of State eugenics which would prejudice the founding of a peoples’ Europe which is what we are all hoping to achieve.

 Mr President, of course, we wish to thank the rapporteur and the Commission for this work and for the evaluation report. I am not going to repeat what other speakers have said but I should like to mention, Commissioner, three specific cases that have been brought to my attention this week. The first concerns the mother of a handicapped teenager who goes out to work. For some time, every evening, she has had to go and fetch him, because he is supposed to return home from work at around 5 p.m. but there, he has free access to pornographic sites. This is happening in a major city in France. As things stand, she cannot turn to the local police to close down these sites. Secondly, a letter that I received this week informed me of a site funded jointly by the Ministry of Health and the Ministry of Education. This site states that the role of adults is to allow children to sample everything, to try every experience. And there are a number of very specific examples – I shall provide the relevant documents later – funded from the public purse, of the type of thing our children are looking at these days. Thirdly, organisations that fight against paedophilia last week sent me a CD-ROM which brings together a large amount of information that is currently available. This CD-ROM was sent to authorities such as Europol over a year ago and no progress at all has yet been made on the matter. Soon, Commissioner, on 8 May, a world summit on children will take place. This afternoon, we will be voting on a resolution on the matter. We would like you, between now and this summit, to hold a meeting with all of the competent bodies to tell us what practical measures you intend to adopt in this field in order to combat this phenomenon.

 Mr President, I in turn would like to thank Mr Fatuzzo for his report, presented as always with a great deal of passion, which is situated in a demographic context, as indeed the United Nations Secretary-General has just emphasised at the Second World Assembly on Ageing, currently being held in Madrid. He reiterated on this occasion that in 2040, there will be more people in the world who are over 60 years old than there will be under fifteen. The forecasts for European demographic change are even more significant, as 40% of the European population will be 65 or over in 2025, according to Eurostat. Therefore, the consequences for the balance of pensions systems, in particular, of this ageing of the population – which is in fact an undeniable sign of progress in terms of health and social aspects – give cause for concern, as the current proportion of four workers to one pensioner will only be two workers to one pensioner in 2030. That is why the European debate particularly welcomes the Commission’s communication, which aims to guarantee safe and sustainable pensions through an integrated approach to the strategies of the Member States, whose pension schemes, especially state schemes, are managed at national level. It should be noted that many countries of the European Union have begun to take bold steps to perpetuate their pensions systems. This is not the case of the French Government, which has not implemented the urgent and essential reforms, and, what is more, the national debate with which we are faced in France is evidence of this. What I would like to point out here, in particular by referring to the Fatuzzo report, is that although the organisation and financing of state pensions must remain the responsibility of the Member States, the open coordination method proposed in this field by the Gothenburg Council should certainly encourage national reforms and enrich them with experiences of other States. In this regard, Commissioner, we look forward to the presentation of the first national plans in the autumn, while insisting once again that the European Parliament should be more closely involved in this procedure. Also from this perspective, unlike others, I am delighted that the Barcelona European Council of 15 and 16 March 2002 committed, on the one hand, to stepping up efforts to provide mature workers with greater possibilities of remaining in the job market, for example by means of flexible gradual retirement programmes and guaranteeing genuine access to education and life-long training, and, on the other, to gradually increasing the average retirement age in the European Union by about five years by 2010. It seems to me that we should be able to offer, in the current context, an approach of free choice, based on employees’ individual careers and their various life stages, which sometimes require them to keep working past retirement age, as obligatory retirement can lead to an immeasurable waste of human resources.

 Mr President, almost two years ago, we adopted the Charter of Fundamental Rights. The right to knowledge and, consequently, the right to know how to read, write and count are part of this Charter. Consequently, the opportunity to learn how to read and write should be available to all as a fundamental right, and parents, teachers and politicians should recognise their obligation to ensure that this opportunity is grasped by all, in particular because, when people cannot express themselves with words, they often do so with their fists, as they feel excluded from school, business or even their own family. This right to knowledge is not currently realised, however, as 10 to 20% of the population of the European Union, or as many as 30 % if we count the candidate countries, are considered to be illiterate: 45% in Portugal, 35% in Italy, 22% in Ireland and Great Britain, 15% in Germany and France and, to add the candidate countries: 42% in Slovenia and Poland, 33% in Hungary, 29% in Bulgaria and 20% in Lithuania. Illiteracy increases the divide between privileged members of society who are in a situation of relative security and those who are disadvantaged and marginalised, who do not have access to the labour market and consequently suffer financial insecurity, psychological isolation and social exclusion. From an economic perspective, we all know that illiteracy also affects our businesses and their modernisation: it leads to increases in costs relating to the accident rate, employers’ contributions and time taken to complete work because of the need for additional supervision. However, although the European Commission and our institutions have produced a number of documents, there are still a number of obstacles: gaps due to a lack of reliable data, the lack of clarity of certain programmes proposed and policies which are still insufficiently integrated. This matter, which I consider to be serious, Commissioner, should also be addressed through integrated policies associating social, and cultural and educational objectives, and should be discussed at policy level to increase awareness of this phenomenon. It is with this in mind that I call on the Commission to submit to Parliament and the Council a Green Paper on Illiteracy, together with a timetable for achieving tangible objectives along the lines of the social agenda, precisely defining the measures to be taken at European level. In the same vein, I call on the Commission, in connection with the employment guidelines, to propose specific indicators and benchmarks relating to illiteracy, in close cooperation with the social players. I also ask the Commission to submit to Parliament, each year, a written report, incorporating statistical data, on progress towards the objectives of combating illiteracy and social exclusion. We should all be aware that this matter is a key issue for development and for harmony in our societies. We are not always aware of this, which is why I would also like us to be able to set up, not another observatory but, within the European Centre for the Development of Vocational Training, based at Thessaloniki, a sort of European illiteracy monitoring centre, as suggested by my group, specifically by submitting Amendment No 5. Lastly, I would like to say, with regard to the amendments tabled recently, in particular by the Group of the Greens, that I am in favour of Amendment No 4 and that I would have been in favour of Amendment No 2 had it been considered as an additional item. As for Amendment No 3, even though I am not against it in principle - the amendment requesting a Green Paper on illiteracy and mathematical illiteracy - I call for a vote against it because I think that, in the wording “Green Paper on Illiteracy”, the problem of mathematical illiteracy is obviously included. Lastly, I cannot accept Amendment No 1. Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, those were the points I wanted to mention.

Mr President, it is unusual to speak twice in a row in the same day. I would like to thank you, Commissioner, for your comments and suggestions, which we will have to discuss. Commissioner, we have greatly criticised the Nice Summit, yet it has provided you with a valuable instrument: the Social Agenda, which was drawn up with the objective of making the European Union the world’s most competitive economy, as decided at the Lisbon Summit. As we all know that there is no openness between European, national and local partners, this agenda raises the issue of responsibility and attribution of powers of all those playing a part in its implementation. It is in its dual role of ensuring openness and acting as a social instrument that the Social Agenda is a key component of economic and social modernisation, as its implementation will, in the long term, be decisive for achieving the strategic objectives laid down by the Lisbon European Council. We are sure of this, even if it is not currently given much consideration. That, Commissioner, is why Parliament and its Committee on Employment and Social Affairs deeply regretted not having been able to consider the Social Agenda prior to the Stockholm European Council. We therefore ask that Parliament be involved in the implementation of the adjustment of the Social Agenda, as well as all the social partners, and we insist that, from now on, the scoreboard make clearer the various responsibilities of the parties involved. We also call on the Commission to supply information on how it proposes to act on a number of requests we have made: to define an appropriate legal basis for the development of civil dialogue; to provide a tax and legislative framework for the development of the social economy; to integrate the social dimension into competition policy; to submit a directive on social security cover for new forms of employment; to reinforce the action programme and instruments against poverty and social exclusion and submit a proposal to amend Directive 92/85/EC on introducing measures to help improve the health and safety of female workers; and to launch an initiative aimed at better guaranteeing the social quality of work. You will also understand, Commissioner, that we are calling on you to speed up a number of operations: in particular to submit a proposal for a review of the enterprise committee directive as soon as possible so that the legislative procedure can be concluded as intended, to submit to Parliament a memorandum on policy in the area of health and safety at work that could serve as a consultation document, to conduct in-depth examination and assessment of the impact of the Luxembourg process, and, lastly, to propose activities to mark the European year of the disabled. Commissioner, we are convinced that this scoreboard should not be confined to setting out actions implemented by the Commission but should eventually become a strategic instrument by means of which the agenda’s implementation can be supervised, and where need be adjusted. We are also convinced that partnerships should be strengthened in all the actions taken in this area. Commissioner, Nice has provided you with a valuable tool. You therefore have a valuable role to play in making social policy more transparent. Take this opportunity to transform this Europe of commodities into a people’s Europe, in the knowledge that Parliament will be right behind you.

 Mr President, at a time when our fellow citizens are asking, now that we have created the Europe of merchandise, to construct a Europe of human beings, the embryo has come to the heart of Europe. At this point I should like to thank the President of the European Parliament for listening to the voices of some of us, following the British work last August authorising cloning for therapeutic purposes, and creating an ad hoc committee which, having held many hearings, gave rise to the Fiori report, which I welcome for its remarkable commitment to this subject. Thus, contrary to other parliaments, such as the French Parliament, for example, we are meeting at the very moment when a private company announces that it has carried out human cloning, under cover of therapeutic purposes. I understand the objective, but we must be aware of the fact that this objective is really, underneath, an alibi, if we remember that there is another objective underlying it, that of the lure of immeasurable profits and potential markets. What is the real issue here? In defiance of the principle of the inalienability and non-patrimoniality of the human body from the moment of conception onwards, which is laid down in all international declarations, it has been proposed that we should become what we are fighting against, organisms genetically modified by the uncontrolled creation of embryos as a source of spare parts for human bodies, thereby making it possible to repair sick people. We know that at any given moment in a decision-making process, there comes a time when it is necessary to look up from what we are doing and ask ourselves the question, ‘Shall I go on or shall I stop’. We believe that the time has come to set a limit, because the line between reproductive cloning and therapeutic cloning is a very thin one, since therapeutic cloning is, in fact, nothing more than interrupted reproductive cloning. I do not know whether I am on the side of ethics, but I am well aware, at any rate, that in expressing myself in this way I am not on the side of modernity. Such archaic classifications are irrelevant, because I believe that the real shock to civilisation lies among the modernists, those neo-scientists who believe that the human being is a material, and those who regard the human being as an essential resource for technical purposes. It was in that spirit that I tabled Amendment No 213 on the non-patentability of living beings, like Amendment No 212, showing that there is no difference between therapeutic and non-therapeutic cloning. It is also in that spirit that I appeal to the President of the European Parliament to allow our committee to become a permanent one, and I appeal to the President of the Commission to involve the parliaments of Europe in bioethics, so as not to deprive the public of this debate, and finally I appeal to the Heads of State and Government to commit to an international convention on bioethics.

 Mr President, the proposal for a directive which is before us for its second reading, falls within the scope of measures that aim to improve the safety and health of workers. As you know, this is an objective that Parliament quite rightly considers very important. We must, however, find a fair balance between, on the one hand, the need to protect the health and safety of workers and, on the other hand, the need to prevent this directive from placing excessive burdens on companies and particularly on small- and medium-sized enterprises. If we adopt overly restrictive exposure limit values, it could, in practice, and technically speaking, turn out to be extremely difficult to abide by them; it could actually harm the interests of workers, either because this could lead to their working time being limited to two hours per day, or because if the limit values are not applied, the protection they do have could be significantly reduced. Since this report only concerns the issue of vibrations, we must also take into account the delicate and hard-won agreement between the various national requirements, and we must not impose further excessive restrictions on the sectors and industries concerned. And in this respect, I would like to say that our Committee was not able to complete its work due to an incredibly busy timetable. We were unable to interview all the relevant people involved before the deadline, and this is something I regret. For these reasons, our group believes that the amendments adopted in the Committee on Employment and Social Affairs are a relatively acceptable compromise between the requirement for the protection of workers and on the competitiveness of European industry. Nevertheless, our group considers that it is essential to include the derogation option for the agricultural and forestry sectors, since the current arrangements for servicing and replacing machinery in these sectors would not enable exposure limit values to be effectively applied. On a personal note, and particularly with regard to the work that we did last week, I would lastly like to thank Mrs Thorning-Schmidt for her cooperation. Mrs Diamantopoulou, I hope that this spirit of openness, as part of our conciliation work with the Council, will enable us to agree on a halfway point so that the directive can be adopted within a reasonable timeframe.

Mr President, would dedicating a resolution from this House on extreme poverty on this occasion be giving in to opportunism? I would like to remind you that on 17 October 1987 Father Wrezinski, with 100 000 people, talked about the life of the poorest families and people in our whole society and since that day, the World Day to overcome extreme poverty reminds us each year that it is our duty to unite in respecting human rights when they are violated. If we adopt this resolution today, we are paying tribute not only to the commitment of the families and people who face extreme poverty themselves, but also to the commitment of all the associations and citizens who stand beside them. Also, throughout the European Union, especially since the Lisbon summit, the public, national and European authorities are constantly highlighting the fight against exclusion and particularly the need for an integration policy. It is in this spirit that today, on behalf of my group, I am presenting this resolution, which asks the Member States to develop real strategies aimed at equal access for all to fundamental rights such as education, housing and healthcare as well as culture and sustainable employment. It is also in this spirit that we are asking the European authorities and, as far as we are concerned, our Committee on Employment and Social Affairs, in cooperation with the Commission, to make an assessment of the policies conducted in the field every 17 October and thirdly, we ask, for the future of course, that a stone be laid in the square in front of the European Parliament in Brussels in honour of the victims of poverty like those laid in the squares at the Trocadero in Paris, the Council of Europe in Strasbourg, in Berlin, Rome and at the UN. It is a simple but nevertheless important tribute that we want to pay today by putting forward this resolution.

 Mr President, the report we are discussing today concerns 12 to 15 million people in Europe, that is, between 8% and 10% of European workers. There are three aspects to this modern evil. There is an economic aspect, since according to the report of the European Foundation for the Improvement of Living and Working Conditions the deterioration in working conditions over the past 10 years is due to the faster working rate and to flexibility in all its forms. There is a sociological aspect, symptomatic of the individualism that is increasingly threatening to take over our society. There is a psychological aspect, which makes harassment particularly odious and can sometimes cause individuals to suffer a breakdown without leaving the slightest trace. At present there is a serious legal vacuum at national level and a wide disparity at European level, which, however, is being counteracted by an increasingly solid body of case law. That is why this report, which is well documented and rigorous, provides a highly encouraging response and sends out a strong signal to the working environment. In paragraph 12, among the envisaged measures, it emphasises the need for more serious dialogue on this subject between all the social partners and the appointment of an independent external mediator, as also advocated in the amendment I tabled, which I regard as an important guarantee of real progress in this field. But it is up to all the European institutions to continue to fight an evil that is now firmly entrenched, as they have been urged to do since the European Social Charter. I therefore welcome the rapporteur's proposal to call on the Commission to publish a Green Paper and to present a Community action programme by next year. On behalf of my group I also support the inclusion of these matters in the Green Paper discussions on corporate social responsibility. We must all support this fight, at our own level, persuaded as we are that society as a whole will enjoy the benefits of balance within society and within individuals.

 Mr President, first of all, I would like to congratulate and thank Mr Menrad for his tenacious and efficient approach to the dossier on employee involvement which has been a stumbling block in negotiations on the Statute for a European Company for several years. Although the first proposal for a regulation dates back to 1970, we had to wait for the Nice European Council before we finally reached an agreement on a draft directive on employee involvement, which supplements the draft regulation on the Statute for a European Company. It was therefore a delicate balance that was found at the Council meeting on 20 December and it is vital to ensure that we retain this balance. That is why Amendment No 4, which requires Member States to make appropriate provisions for negotiations in the case of structural changes, seems hard to accept as it amounts to bringing into question the hard-fought agreement. The same applies to Amendment No 7 which seeks to remove the exhaustive list of rights held by the body representing employees in the participation process, which, in practice, leads to a participation system that disregards specific national characteristics and casts doubt upon the safeguard mechanism of rights to participation, set out in the Annex to the directive. Key players in the economy and society have been waiting for the Statute for the European Company for more than 30 years. We must therefore ensure, ladies and gentlemen, that we fulfil the need expressed by companies for simplicity and flexibility and that we do not, as a result, complicate this statute by incorporating new restrictions which would discourage the companies concerned, and particularly small and medium-sized companies, from using this new tool that is at their disposal.

 Overall, the progress made in implementing the Directive on the establishment of a European works council has been positive, since there are now approximately 650 European works councils, most of which were set up on the basis of pre-Directive agreements, in other words, on a voluntary and agreed basis. There are still 1 200 companies, however, which have not established European works councils. As the effects of globalisation demand new measures, the cornerstone of which are trans-national representation and information, it is advisable to consider the factors which stand in the way of European social dialogue in companies, and the report presented by the Commission which evaluates both legal transposition and practical application of the Directive in Member States now gives us that opportunity. The debates which took place in committee were useful and I would also like to congratulate Mr Menrad for his preference for dialogue and the work he did to achieve conciliation. Nonetheless, the broad consensus which existed within this committee on the need to develop information and consultation, on both a European and national level, must not hide some differences in approach which my colleague, Mr Bushill-Matthews pointed out. I do believe that it is important to reiterate in this Chamber that genuine social dialogue in a company requires tools that are flexible and which can evolve, and not a standard, restrictive and detailed framework, such as that which some of our fellow Members would like to reintroduce when the 1994 Directive is revised. That is why I would like to stress how important we consider that the imminent reform of this directive does not take the shape of a far-reaching reform of its spirit and particularly, that we retain the difference in terms of function between the Directive itself, which is the tool of social dialogue in a company, and its Annex which punishes the failure of social dialogue. Furthermore, lowering the thresholds for applying the Directive must not be an aim in itself; rather, this should be perceived as a straightforward option to extend this mechanism. This is why I agree with Amendment No 3, tabled by our fellow Member, and the French delegation will support this, but we are rather more puzzled by Amendment No 14. Finally, I would like to provide an explanation for the text included in paragraph 2(i), namely that information and consultation of employees must be carried out, with due regard for the principles of confidentiality of the information. This is a very important provision which particularly refers to cases where timely information and consultation of workers, which is perfectly natural, could conflict with the law by virtue of the legislation on the securities market. The provision is therefore fundamental in order to encourage competitiveness of companies in the global economy and the safeguarding of the European social model. I hope that the Commission will take this into account when preparing its proposal for revising the directive.

 Mr President, ten years after the first World Summit for Children, the UN has decided to take stock. In September 2001, on the eve of the summit, our group is naturally tabling a resolution in witness of our commitment, as we have always done. I remember a time when it was difficult to mention the word children in this House. The Dutroux affair had to happen before budget lines could be freed up and a certain number of resolutions passed for our children. We have therefore had some successes. The latest is the reference to children in the Charter of Fundamental Rights, and some of us in this House, notably under the leadership of Mary Banotti, have won a few battles. It is therefore important to restate our commitment and determination on the eve of this summit, and we must also dedicate ourselves even more firmly to the cause of children, not just in Europe, but throughout the world, because there are now 600 million children worldwide in families living on less than a dollar a day, facing the real evils of malnutrition, lack of education and lack of health provision. We must mobilise against those evils. To that end, our resolution proposes providing an institutional context to serve children. First, the various decisions we take should be subject to assessment of their impact on policy on children and family policy, secondly, the Commission should have a unit to deal with children’s issues and, thirdly, a special envoy should coordinate policies on children. Finally, Mr President, we think it is important to be in a position to establish a European solidarity fund for the world’s children.

 Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, Commissioner, our guests from the organisations who are taking their seats in the public gallery, forgive me if I am speaking somewhat slowly, but today is the first time that our debate will be interpreted using sign language, and I would like to inform the Commission that I have also had this report translated into Braille, and this is the first time that a parliamentary assembly has done this. The report will be sent by the Committee on Employment and Social Affairs to all the organisations in all our countries. It is a joy and a source of satisfaction to me to present this evening to the European Parliament the report written in response to the Commission’s communication. It also gives me grounds for hope. It is a joy because I am aware that this report has perhaps more influence than others, or at least in a more direct manner, in bringing about the Europe that I have been hoping and praying for, a humane Europe in which we are all involved and which we all hope to achieve, since we are well aware that, having achieved the single market and monetary union, the 21st century will have to try to bring about a humane European Union. Drafting this report has only served to strengthen my belief that we can only make the future of Europe attractive if we start working on a basis of solidarity, justice and respect for others. This occasion also provides me with a source of satisfaction because, although my name is on the report, it is above all the product of a new working method in which many useful contacts were fostered with the organisations for people with disabilities, which helped me to write it, particularly the European Forum for Disabled People, and I would like to acknowledge here their extremely valuable contribution to this matter. I also derive satisfaction from the high level of interest shown by my fellow Members, since they tabled over 100 amendments to the original draft. In this respect, I would like to say that out of the amendments that were recently tabled, I shall accept two amendments from the Socialist group. I would also like to thank the Commission’s Directorate-General for Education and Culture for taking part and the European Agency for Special Needs Education, which is based in Copenhagen. Lastly, the report fills me with hope because, if it is adopted by the European Parliament, it will enable many doors to be opened to the 37 million citizens who live with a disability. This report will be considered from four perspectives: firstly, ‘mainstreaming’ and the right to be different, secondly, ‘family and disability’, because it is true that a disabled person, whether an infant or an old person, is nonetheless someone’s child or parent and it is within this family environment that the most support can be found. The third perspective is to overcome obstacles and access problems. The fourth perspective is that of consultation and information. On the basis of these perspectives, we put together a number of proposals. The first is, of course, to start working on the year 2003, which is to be named the European Year of the Disabled Citizens, as announced at Nice. Secondly, we believe that it is important that a number of measures be taken in terms of access to benefits. If Italian, French, Belgian or Greek workers leave their own country to work elsewhere, they should continue to receive the benefits to which they are entitled as a disabled person. This also involves mutual recognition of cards carried by people with disabilities throughout the Union. The issue of access should also be extended to education. We all know that disabled people are not fully or properly integrated into school life. That is why I can announce now that on 26 November 2001, the first European meeting dedicated to teaching and disabilities will be held at the Senate in Paris, in conjunction with the European Academy of Medicine. The issue of access also includes transport and public buildings. We heard a speech made by Brian Crowley at the inauguration of this building. In this respect, we can announce a forthcoming directive, for example with regard to lifts. I hope that, in this directive, mandatory standards can be specified for disabled people. That is what I wanted to tell you very briefly, by pointing out that the report that is presented to you today is both a culmination and a point of departure. At a time when we often speak about ‘lobbying’, I hope that, in view of the year 2003, along with all the organisations, we can use our influence on all the Commission and Council bodies to translate these recommendations – or at least some of them – into directives, so that a European disability policy can be developed in Europe.

 The proposal for a directive on equal treatment in employment and occupation before us today is a response to a demand long expressed by the European Parliament, and our group in particular. It is actually one of three parts of a package of measures on combating discrimination based on the new Article 13, introduced by the Treaty of Amsterdam, and includes a Community action programme. These texts should, then, fill a glaring gap in the construction of Europe: recognition of the real needs of people excluded or marginalised in our societies because of disability, age, or membership of a minority. The texts therefore represent some of the first steps towards the people’s Europe that we have wanted for so long. So, I enthusiastically support this proposal for a directive and the very positive amendments proposed by our rapporteur to improve its effectiveness. In so doing, I wish to stress the importance of the amendments to improve the protection of people with disabilities by clarifying the terms ‘reasonable accommodation’ of the workplace and ‘undue hardship’ for the employer, and those toughening the ban on discrimination against older people who freely choose to go on working – 63% of Europeans aged 55-64 do not work – and those strengthening the vital autonomy of management and the unions as well as the crucial role of social dialogue in actually implementing equal treatment in businesses. In parallel, the amendment extending the exception to the principle of non-discrimination to the wider ‘social’ activities of religious organisations, where the discrimination is solely based on religious conviction and on no other grounds, is a reinforcement of the specific nature and original contribution of these structures as compared with public or private services. On the other hand, the amendments providing for penalties against companies infringing the principle of equal treatment by excluding them from public contracts seem to me both poorly adapted to the purpose and subject to divergent interpretation. In addition, they open the door to distortions in competition between businesses in different European Union countries. That is why I wish to express reservations on that point, while voting in favour of the text as a whole.

 Mr President, this is a serious and complex subject, which has been brought to the fore by the British decision. It should also be pointed out that national legislation on this issue varies enormously, which can lead to uncontrolled practices, but these practices, as Mrs Grossetête said just now, may make us question the value some countries place on the reality of the principle of respect for human life from the embryonic stage, stated in Article 18 of the European Convention on Human Rights, which forbids the production of embryos for human purposes. The difference between provisions shows how complex the debate is and raises several questions that merge into one another. What does respect for life mean? What does the pre-embryo mean in relation to the embryo? Do we have the right to authorise research into the embryo for therapeutic purposes? Where do the stem cells come from? Should embryos be cloned? Do stem cells come from foetal tissue as well as from adult tissue? Do we have the right to create embryos for any purposes other than for life itself? In the face of serious illnesses, which are currently incurable, do we have the right to prevent research being carried out, which we are told may bring hope? All of these questions are laden with consequences and concern the meaning of life itself. This is why we must have dialogue, especially within the European bodies, and I regret the fact, Commissioner, that President Prodi gave a sneak preview of his interventions on Monday to the press before he shared them with the European Parliament. I must say that his comments were very cautious and carefully measured on this issue. Secondly, I think that in order to hold this debate, Parliament should create an ad hoc Parliamentary committee which, could, in the first instance, quickly take the initiative of hearing experts from all disciplines, both from Europe and from across the Atlantic. This debate must also, however, be held in the public domain. That is why I propose that European ‘assises’ for bioethics be launched and there should finally be a provision which allows us to frame practices in this area at a time when we are pointlessly establishing monitoring centres. I propose that a European Agency for reproductive and biotechnological medicine be created.

Minister, it is a great pleasure to see you here again. The new economy and globalisation are producing an acceleration of industrial change and Parliament has several times discussed this issue and has established –I myself was the rapporteur – a certain number of procedures and the European works councils, and has done work on information to and consultation of workers. We are awaiting the results of these, Commissioner, because you know we are very committed to them. We have also established procedures like the participation of employees in the capital, profits and results of the company, all indispensable procedures during industrial restructuring and change. Of course there is still a great deal to be done in this field, but it seems to me that if we need to improve this type of procedure, as my colleagues have said, and it is not uptight to say so – we now have bodies in Europe like the Foundation in Dublin and the European Agency for Health and Safety in Bilbao, with which our Committee on Employment and Social Affairs cooperates, that are in a position to evaluate the consequences of these industrial changes effectively. And we should not forget that both sides of industry also have an indispensable role to play as regards industrial change at the European and the social level. More particularly, I hope the existing bodies will be required to contribute to making industrial change increasingly transparent and, Commissioner, I hope the texts we are waiting for, on information to and consultation of workers, and the European company, will one day be submitted to this Parliament.
Hermange (PPE-DE

) Mr President, this text is important insofar as the legislation concerned has significant consequences for the well-being of women and also children, that is, the future of our society. In this respect, we may well be surprised that the Commission has waited as long as it has to present us with its evaluation report on the implementation of this directive and proposals for improving conditions for maternity leave. It seems to me that, in this proposal for a revision of the directive that we are asking the Commission to present quickly, it is essential to preserve the reality of three fundamental principles for women and their well-being: the prohibition of dismissal for pregnant women or women on maternity leave, the right to a mandatory minimum leave and allowance during this leave to be taken into account for the purposes of acquiring pension entitlements. Furthermore, it seems to me that this new directive should comprise substantial improvements, in particular all women must be offered the opportunity to take 20 weeks’ maternity leave, without necessarily being obliged to take the entire period, but the employer shall be obliged to offer it, and a minimum of 8 weeks after the birth, in order to foster development of the bond between mother and child. With regard to high-risk pregnancies and the birth of disabled children, it is obvious that provision must be made for specially adapted proposals offering an extension of the length of maternity leave, taking account of the specifics of the case. As far as definition of the allowance is concerned, it seems that the figure to be considered must be at least 80% of the previous salary, and that includes for purposes of acquiring pension entitlements. Finally, it is recommended that this text should correlate and reinforce the formal prohibition of dismissal during pregnancy and maternity leave.

 Mr President, we must thank Bartho Pronk and the chairman of our committee for speaking about civil dialogue and relations between the Commission and NGOs, because, in the final analysis, the report and other contributions seem to me to be purely administrative and far removed from the practical reality, and this is exactly the impression I had, Commissioner, when you answered Bartho Pronk. You told us that the Commission was active in meeting the operating costs of NGOs, but what we Members of Parliament want is to ensure that all NGOs, may be supported and funded on the basis of a number of practical projects. For, nowadays, it is the major NGOs which have the opportunity to respond to a number of invitations to tender: Médecins du monde
, Médecins sans frontières
, the Red Cross and so on and so forth. That is my first comment. You must be aware of the problems experienced by a good number of smaller NGOs in being able to respond to a number of invitations to tender. The work they do in terms of relations and competencies is, however, just as important as that of the major NGOs, but some of them do not have the same administrative facilities that some major NGOs have. Secondly, what we would also like to see is the needs of NGOs being satisfied before a major tragedy occurs. Let me take just one example, the protection of childhood. For four years, a number of Members of Parliament have been fighting for funding for associations working to combat child abuse. Our attempts have been ignored. It was not until the Dutroux case that we were able to obtain a budget line enabling two programmes to be run: Daphne and STOP. Today, regrettably, only one programme is left, the Daphne programme. I can tell you that, as experts on matters to do with small children, a number of NGOs would indeed love to be able to respond to specific invitations to tender. Finally, I feel it advisable to simplify the procedures and that, in this connection – I do not know if this has to be a fund –, the Commission should, at least initially, make a service available to NGOs, enabling them to obtain information on the work carried out by other parties and, possibly, establish networks on certain topics in order, ultimately, to be able to submit tenders to the Commission when offers come up. That, Commissioner, is what I wished to say. We shall make progress in the social sector because we know that we have to make progress in terms of cooperation in that sector. We need time for this. This is precisely why, given that social matters are essentially part of the remit of NGOs, we must make progress in the matter of civil dialogue.

 Mr President, we see the reality of the situation all around us. If 23% of Europe’s population is over 65 years old today, this figure will have reached 40% by 2025, and the proportion of four working people to every retired person will have become two working people to every retired person by 2020. This demonstrates the pressing need to allow the development of supplementary self-funded high return pension schemes in the European Union to usefully supplement state contributory pension schemes. As we all know, our Member States are working towards ambitious structural reforms, but it is also up to the European Union to intervene in the area of pensions, particularly supplementary pensions, in order to facilitate the free movement of workers in the context of the single market, to establish a genuine single capital market and also to ensure that equality between men and women is respected.  With this in mind, the Committee on Employment and Social Affairs has been concerned to reconcile the security and efficiency of supplementary pensions for future pensioners as it is true that the guarantee of a high level of security for beneficiaries encourages healthy and desirable competition between European pension funds. This is why our Committee feels that the proposal for a directive on Community prudential regulations applying to pension funds must be tabled and adopted as quickly as possible, bearing in mind our discussion today, with proper guarantees for the external and internal supervision of the funds concerned and for the calculation of their prudential commitment. Furthermore, in order to encourage the free movement of workers, we felt it essential to quickly improve the transferability and the acquisition of pension rights from supplementary schemes from different European countries. This is the opinion of the Committee on Employment and Social Affairs.

Mr President, Mr President-in-Office of the Council, Mr President of the Commission, the Special European Council in Lisbon on employment, economic reform and social cohesion is to pursue, as you have told us, an objective which is ambitious, very ambitious, at the risk of disappointing our fellow citizens, conscious as they are that decreeing full employment and the eradication of poverty in Europe cannot, in itself, ensure that this objective is attained. But, when all is said and done, this summit will have a major benefit – that of outlining, in the wake of Cardiff and Luxembourg, a political desire for greater social cohesion, particularly as regards the 57 million people who are living in a state of poverty within the Union, including single mothers, large families and children, and whose numbers will in the future be swelled by other outcasts from society, specifically those people who will not have access to new areas of knowledge, since this will engender new social imbalances.  It would thus be appropriate to implement an economic and social policy which is firmly geared towards the future, in order to prevent the emergence of a digital gulf between the ‘info-rich’ and the ‘info-poor’, which is to say, as one speaker has just put it, a digital divide. It is for this reason that, while I feel that new technologies constitute a tremendous vector for socially-inclusive growth, they will only be so if they are taught from an early age, in that by 2010 fifty per cent of all jobs will be in sectors directly linked to information technologies. I recommend that Lisbon Summit take three decisions in this regard: firstly, on a strategy for lifelong learning, with the establishing of an agenda for eradicating child poverty, both financial and intellectual impoverishment; secondly, on preparing European society for the European research area; thirdly, on implementing a working methodology and coordination procedure which is open and based on our social and economic policies, and is accompanied by concerted assessment of our national plans.

 The construction of Europe has for too long ignored private law, and the Citizens' Europe, which we represent, must, as we said last night on the occasion of the tenth anniversary of the International Convention, henceforth take into consideration the real concerns of families and the welfare of children. We all have a recollection of a number of cases, such as the Lancelin-Thiemann case which last year contaminated discussions between Germany and France on the subject of the dramatic situation of the children of this couple. The Gebhardt report rightly stresses that the increasing level of free movement within the European Union is causing and will in future cause an increasing number of marriages between nationals of different countries, hence the interest of examining this question. Current European law has not managed to draw the conclusions of this development, thus placing couples, and more particularly children, in a very complex position. The regulation submitted for our opinion today is therefore particularly welcome in so far as it includes unquestionable advantages in relation to the so-called Brussels II Convention, signed in 1998, but not as yet ratified. If it is unanimously adopted in Council, this regulation may come into force very soon and shall be applied immediately and harmoniously throughout the European Union, thus enabling long drawn out wrangling over jurisdiction, which is harmful to everyone, to be prevented. I would add that this proposal for a regulation specifically targets legal judgements relating to parental responsibility for joint children, corresponding to the requests made on several occasions by this House. But, like other Members, I am concerned by two amendments, Amendment No 2 and Amendment No 5, which is going to attribute a number of responsibilities relating to parental authority to the Court of Justice. I am afraid that this is not a matter for its jurisdiction and, moreover, that this may increase the caseload of this Court. In my opinion, we should stick to the Commission text. If this is the case, I shall support Mrs Gebhardt’s report, which I hope will be widely adopted by Parliament in these terms. If there were just one thing to bear in mind, this would be the interest of the children, and I have my doubts as to whether it would be in the interest of the children if Parliament were to adopt these two amendments. Children are the ones with a lot to gain from the rapid implementation of regulations acknowledging their simple right not to have to endure the choice of their parents to live in different European countries. Of course, major problems will remain, particularly the matter of the disparity of applicable divorce laws and the consequences of this, but this regulation is just an initial step and I congratulate the rapporteur on this initiative.

 Mr President, on the occasion of the tenth anniversary of this Convention, a text which recognises the child as an individual in its own right, by giving it its own rights (the right to life, the right to identity and to a family, the right of expression and the right to be fed and educated) it is nevertheless still true that on our continent every thirty seconds, a child is abused, raped or beaten up, is indoctrinated, and is the victim of inadequate policies, changes in family and financial circumstances, a victim too of the fact that we are not applying this international Convention.  It is therefore our duty, at the end of the century to ask ourselves why there are millions of children who are forced into prostitution, who kill themselves, who take drugs, and as our continent is only just beginning to discover the terrible effects of paedophilia, to which we have closed our eyes for such a long time, we must ask ourselves why, in our countries which are developed in terms of democracy and economics, which proudly celebrate the Declaration on Human Rights every year, these rights are flouted when the most vulnerable in our society, that is children, are concerned.  With this in mind, Commissioner, we hope that our children will become much more visible. During the last Parliamentary term, I tabled a report on behalf of Parliament on the protection of children and the family in which I asked for a visible budget for our children and for the creation, within the Commission, of a special unit responsible for protecting children and the family. In it I also highlighted the need to bring together, at our own behest, an extraordinary European Council on the future of policies on the family and on protecting children in the Union and to present an annual report to Parliament comparing legislation on this issue in our respective countries.  Finally, we hope, and I too hope, like many of my fellow MEPs, that we can contemplate, within the framework of the IGC, the introduction of an indisputable legal basis for actions favouring children and the family. Whereas in 2001 a report will be made at the UN of the first World Summit on Children, I suggest that within our own Parliament, we create a European Children’s Parliament, established together with them, to celebrate this European World Summit in 2001.

 Mr President, I would like, in turn, to congratulate the rapporteur on his excellent contribution and also to thank the administrative staff of the Committee on Employment and Social Affairs who, considering the conditions we had to work in, assisted us until late in the evening. Thanks to the constructive proposals for employment policies of Member States for the year 2000, proposals based on a fair analysis of the joint report on employment, Mr Menrad’s report outlines the route to be taken for Europe to maximise the potential of its extraordinary human capital. It is significant, too, that the report makes mention of demographic trends, as it is true that an ageing continent is a continent which is committing economic suicide. The report falls completely in line with the Luxembourg Process, for which, personally, I would have preferred objectives giving specific figures, and it is also in line with our desire to receive the report proposed by the Commission on the annual national employment action plans. In this respect I share the opinion of the rapporteur who stresses the need for our institution, jointly with the Commission, to supervise the implementation of European initiatives on employment within Member States. It is essential for a transparent and democratic public debate to take place and I have no doubt that if the Luxembourg process took place it was because Parliament was to some extent instrumental in this. But what I would like to say is that I consider it to be essential that this strategy which is just beginning to bear fruit should not be obstructed by rigid measures which are not adapted to the interests of businesses or of workers. Yesterday, members of the French Parliament met with French industrialists, and they reiterated that they did not want to see rigid and unsuitable measures obstructing this movement in favour of employment. Now to the second part of my intervention. I would like to stress the role of social dialogue within the framework of this policy. Social dialogue must be renewed. It is essential for workers to participate in the decisions which affect them and if, at the time, Mr Schweitzer, the chairman of Renault, had consulted the European Advisory Committee, created and proposed by this House, we would no doubt not have had the Vilvorde affair, and we would not perhaps have had the Michelin case. Secondly, the voluntary participation of employees in the production capital of their firm is also desirable and urgently needed, as the rapporteur writes in Amendment No 12 to the employment guidelines, for two reasons: firstly, for financial reasons, involving the need to improve businesses’ allocation of equity capital, in order to withstand the dictates of the major investment funds and to safeguard employment, but also for a human reason connected with the evolution of jobs in the future, requiring an ever higher level of training and a personal commitment which is only given true worth and encouraged intelligently by profit sharing.

 Mr President, the European Union must have a competitive industry, one that creates wealth and thus jobs.  This means that within the Union, we must arrive at a real coordination of fiscal policies and at a definition of comparable social norms for everyone, so that we no longer experience the distortions of competition that are still too marked today. This also means that we must prepare our companies to support globalisation and to adapt to it. We might wish that this globalisation did not exist, but it does. It is up to us to manage it in such a way that its negative aspects can be avoided. In this context, we find ourselves facing the difficult problem of relocation. The problem is difficult because obviously it eliminates jobs in Europe, difficult because the people vilifying relocations today are the same people who are, at the same time, demanding that Europe should multiply its investment in developing countries and should make it as easy as possible for products made in those countries to enter European Union territory.  As far as the Michelin affair is concerned, since everyone is talking about it, despite our all saying that it is not the subject under discussion, on the day the Michelin redundancies were announced, Pirelli was doing the same thing, on just the same scale, but nobody is talking about that. Michelin today consists of 82 production plants, 48 of which are in Europe. I would be very interested to know how many car manufacturers, including those in public ownership, or tyre manufacturers, including those in semi-public ownership, still have such a major presence in Europe today and have not already quietly relocated, sometimes with the assistance of governments, including left-wing governments. Today, we should tell it like it is. Michelin has, it is true, reduced the number of its jobs by 25,000 in twenty years but, I would like to remind some people, these are 25,000 job losses due to levels of productivity which are comparable in all sectors of industry, and particularly in the car and tyre industries. These are 25,000 job losses, only 186 of which have been redundancies. So for goodness’ sake, let us stop trying to find scapegoats for the way industry or restructuring is evolving. People are telling us to just look at the profits being made on the stock markets. Well, excuse me. Do look at the profits made on the stock market, but look at all the profits for all businesses for last year or the last two years, and let me remind Mr Wurtz that he, or rather his friends, are members of a government which does nothing to stop profits being made on the stock market.

 Mr President, a nuclear accident always provokes highly emotional reactions, fear and even irrational terror. The events in Chernobyl affected our mood for a long time. But in Tokaimura, the Japanese authorities have themselves recognised that the safety procedures, both in the conversion plant and in the fuel production plant, had not been followed. It was therefore not an unforeseeable accident. Apart from our sympathy and friendship towards the families affected by this drama, what are the lessons and consequences to be drawn from this accident? The first lesson is clearly that it is imperative that the European and national authorities in each of our States deal with the question of safety procedures. Secondly, it seems very clear to me that the IAEA should intervene more regularly, not only to verify the text of the regulations, which it does too often, but also to do what it has not done often enough, that is, to go to the site to verify that the regulations are really being applied. In the case of Tokaimura, the IAEA should, in any case, ask the Japanese authorities not to authorise the resumption of reprocessing activities before a thorough investigation is carried out and before public and transparent conclusions are published. For us, the European Parliament, it seems to us more necessary than ever that the European Commission, within the framework of its Euratom competences, not only lends its assistance to Japan in the current circumstances, but also asks the Euratom services to carry out a complete analysis of the official safety regulations for our power stations, and around our power stations, in Europe. In this way, it would be in a position to ascertain whether all the safety conditions are being respected and to know whether further urgency procedures can be added in the case of regrettable human negligence, which are ultimately much worse or at least they have been in the last few years, than the unforeseeable accident which, by definition, can spread terror. We are in favour, Mr President, of the use of nuclear energy and we know that, in the European Union, the safety rules and conditions are stricter and more respected. Or at least we are told, for example, that the initiation of a nuclear chain reaction as a result of faulty handling by an operator is practically impossible in Europe. This is what happened in Tokaimura. We wish to avoid two pitfalls, Mr President. On the one hand, the blind, unconditional and uncontrolled support for nuclear energy. But also on the other hand, the manipulation by too many people of public opinion in order to spread irrational fears and terrors which were well known a thousand years ago. These were the famous millennium fears of the year 1000. Today, they are the fears on the eve of the year 2000. No, nuclear power does not kill any more than a traditional source such as coal has killed and still kills. That is the purpose of our resolution today.

Mr President, yesterday we held a debate here on the strengthening of food safety in Europe, while conflicts on the precautionary principle are taking place within the Union and in parallel, the Americans are pursuing unjustified retaliations. The situation in the agricultural and food-processing sectors has become more serious over the last few years, although we were theoretically covered by the Uruguay Round and the Marrakech Agreements, which were supposed to guarantee and organise access to the market, support for exports and internal support. So you will appreciate, Commissioner, our concern at the apparent absence of shared views within the Union before the beginning of the negotiation, while the United States seems very determined to oppose the European system of subsidies, while skilfully absolving themselves from flexibility payments. In fact negotiations cannot get under way seriously until we persuade our partners and competitors to recognise the European Agricultural Model. It is this model which, based on the Community preference, guarantees product quality, food safety and the survival and development of our agricultural and food-processing sectors.  Commissioner, we have been happy to note your answers to the committee as well as your words at the beginning of this sitting. But we would like to know whether you can tell us how the Americans have reacted to the European position in favour of extending the peace clause beyond 2003. Could you also tell us whether the United States are demanding compensation or the disappearance of the green and blue boxes which amused Mr Martinez so much but which are absolutely essential for our farmers? Finally could you tell us whether you consider that the conclusions of the Berlin Council on the reform of the CAP are an inviolable basic element in your eyes or whether they are under threat in the new negotiations?

 Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, the French Members of the PPE/ED have come to a generally positive assessment of the Prodi Commission. This positive opinion is not, however, either a rubber cheque, or a blank cheque. It is not a worthless rubber cheque, Mr President, as we are aware of the developments in relation to the previous Commission. Mr Prodi has undertaken, at the request of groups, our own in particular, some very clear commitments as regards the transparency of the actions of the Commission, consultation with Parliament, and the responsibility of Members of the Commission towards this House. On the major issues coming up – negotiations on the World Trade Organisation, the Intergovernmental Conference, debates on the case of the Mediterranean – the President of the Commission also indicated his wish to include all the Members of this Parliament as parties involved, as decision makers. This is a step in the right direction. But still we cannot give you a blank cheque. Firstly, because, even though the hearings of the Commissioners went well on the whole, they did not give rise to unanimous enthusiasm. In July already, without implicating the individuals, we denounced the political imbalance of this Commission which hardly corresponds to the distribution of power within this Chamber. In September, some of the Commissioners did not necessarily seem to us to be up to the ambitious plans which you defined yourself. This morning, Mr President, you stated that you wanted an integrated and efficient administration, competent Commissioners above all suspicion, a political programme for the next five years, in full collaboration with Parliament. How could we possibly not approve? Mr President, the great challenges which await us – expansion, deepening of a European reality while respecting national identities by the new approach of subsidiarity, the safekeeping of our agricultural systems, the construction of a more humane Europe in the field of employment, a more generous Europe – are such that we must accept them together. But while we can not give you a rubber cheque or a blank cheque, we can announce our wish to work together in order to give all the peoples of Europe, in spite of difficulties and conflicts, good reasons to believe in their own destiny and to have faith in their shared future.
