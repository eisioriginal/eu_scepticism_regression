 Mr President, I believe that we are now at a key moment when it comes to the future of European immigration policy, a moment of truth in which every man and woman needs clearly to perceive what is at stake. What, precisely, is Europe’s response to these challenges? At present, it is –it has to be said – a mixture of compassion and repression that offers no real solution to the recognised need for protection. Let us be aware in this House of the dangers of disposable immigration in which the migrant is seen only in a utilitarian perspective. Hypocrisy has prevailed since the first Tampere European Council, which was ultimately supposed to make it possible for asylum and immigration policies to be communitised. We are now seeing our responsibilities assumed instead by our southern Mediterranean neighbours, who have a lot of difficulty in taking on this very heavy burden. How, then, is it possible to believe that we shall be able to stem these migratory flows at a time when, in addition, the future arrival of refugees from climate change is already being foreseen? We need finally to leave behind short-term politics and to support policies that require action to be taken. (The President cut off the speaker)

I voted against the European budget planned for the period 2007-2013 because, in my opinion, it represents a tragic lack of European ambition and the return to intergovernmental practices of which I disapprove and which will paralyse all European public action, and this at the expense of Europeans. With a sum of EUR 864 billion, or 1.05% of the gross domestic product of the 25 Member States, the financial perspective is not equal to Europe's historic enlargement to incorporate ten new Member States, or the challenges awaiting it for the future. I believe that we are very far removed from the much-hyped demands made at the start of the negotiations (indeed, in June 2005, the European Parliament voted in favour of a budget totalling EUR 974 billion, or 1.18% of GDP); this budget, I am afraid to say, goes hand in hand with a reduction in the Structural Funds and the Cohesion Fund and with a fall in competitiveness, growth and employment, and will rule out any modernisation. As an MEP, it was therefore my responsibility to reject an agreement such as this, which runs counter to the idea I have of a great Europe.

Mr President, Mrs Gastinger, Mr Frattini, ladies and gentlemen, I welcome the opportunity given to us today to debate the European judicial area on the basis of my report on the still very recent, and therefore inevitably fragmented, assessment of one year’s implementation of the European Arrest Warrant. We have already had the opportunity to debate this matter. Before turning specifically to the European Arrest Warrant, I should like to make one small point, because, underpinning this concept of a judicial area, which was formulated very gradually after the Geneva Appeal in 1996, was the ambition to give Europeans a common sense of justice in an environment in which the authorities do everything possible to prevent Europeans’ freedom – from being circumvented or their rights from being flouted. In October 1999, the Tampere Summit marked an important stage, with the introduction of the mutual recognition principle. This change has been radical. It involves mutual confidence, the exercising of shared sovereignty and the recognition of the European area as a common territory. Since then – as we have seen – problems persist and people need to be aware of these. It must be said that the inspiration and ambition that motivated the Heads of State or Government at Tampere have not injected the same degree of enthusiasm into the debates on the texts presented since then. Mutual recognition has inspired many projects, but it is the creation of the European Arrest Warrant that is undoubtedly the symbolic measure. The warrant does, in fact, represent a definite step forward, despite encountering persistent problems. What, then, was the aim of this measure, which officially entered into force on 1 January 2004? The European Arrest Warrant applies to a broader range of offences than those covered by the extradition procedure. Thanks to this warrant, the surrender procedure has become an entirely judicial, and no longer political, process – which is a bonus. The bottom line is that EU law can now be interpreted correctly by practitioners, whereas existing extradition law relies on an abundance of bilateral and national agreements. Furthermore, it has been pointed out on several occasions – including in Article 1 of the framework decision – that, when issuing and implementing the arrest warrant, the Member States and the judicial authorities must ensure that they strictly comply with the principles laid down in the Charter of Fundamental Rights. Once the principles of this instrument are laid down, how are they implemented? We now have at our disposal an assessment carried out, as I said, over only a short space of time by the European Commission, and we must therefore remain cautious when faced with the results of this assessment, which is not yet complete. Some of the planned objectives have been fully achieved. For example, the Arrest Warrant came in very useful recently in the prosecution of an Ethiopian suspected by the British authorities of having been involved in the London bombings. His extradition by the Italian authorities was obtained in record time. Another success was the arrest of a corrupt judge, wanted by her country, Greece. The European Arrest Warrant is an undeniable success story, with 3 000 warrants issued in 2004, 1 000 people arrested and 650 people handed over. The 2005 figures will undoubtedly show an increase, but they will not be officially available until June or July. The extradition procedure has been made much shorter. By replacing the old extradition procedure with the European Arrest Warrant, the average duration of the procedures has gone from nine months to 43 days, which is an appreciable gain for both the judges and those standing trial. Lastly – and most importantly – the procedure is no longer in any way politicised because it no longer involves governments, but only the justice system. It must be said, however, that the application of the European Arrest Warrant has hit several stumbling blocks. Last autumn, for example, and in response to Berlin’s refusal to extradite the German-Syrian citizen Mamoun Darkazanli, an alleged Al-Qaeda figure, Spanish law declared the European Arrest Warrant issued by Germany to be null and void. Several Member States are also attempting to reinstate elements of the traditional system, such as the verification of double criminality. To the optional grounds for non-execution provided for by the framework decision, some Member States have added other grounds for refusing extradition. Even more importantly, the issue of fundamental rights has given rise to considerable transposition problems in Poland and Germany. This difficulty must be interpreted as a failure to understand the principle of mutual recognition, and yet this principle is precisely the foundation on which the European judicial area is entirely constructed. In conclusion, I would say that the European Arrest Warrant marks an important step forward in the fight against crime – above all in terms of serving Europeans - and in the creation of a European judicial area. The fact remains that there is still a host of problems and that these problems must not be underestimated. The first problem stems from the fact that our judicial systems are too different from one another. The second problem is that most of the Member States are still too keen to control international legal assistance. Even though the judicial system is a product of history, the issues that arise are going to have to be dealt with. To conclude: is more or less harmonisation needed? I believe that more is needed. Should more progress be made in terms of the mutual recognition of systems? I believe that, here too, the answer is yes.

Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I am delighted that it should at last be possible for us to voice our opinions on Mr Gollnisch’s immunity, as this series of postponements of our vote has lasted too long. We have spent long enough evaluating the facts. I will not repeat in this House these facts exactly as they stand, but I want to emphasise that it is entirely right to support Mrs Wallis’ report, which proposes waiving Mr Gollnisch’s immunity for several reasons. The first, and by no means least important, reason is that Mr Gollnisch did not make the incriminating remarks as a Member of the European Parliament. The immunity enjoyed by all Members of the European Parliament is designed to protect their freedom of expression in the exercise of their duties. In this case, Mr Gollnisch was not exercising his parliamentary duties. Immunity does not equal irresponsibility, just as freedom of expression cannot be used to justify intolerable behaviour. The second reason is that, in the case in point, the values of the European Union that we, as Members of the European Parliament, are supposed to defend, have been scorned. Far – very far – from these humanist values, Mr Gollnisch, who is a good pupil of Mr Le Pen, tried to rival his master in the provocation stakes with the remarks he made at that press conference. We must therefore strongly condemn these remarks. Finally, the third and final reason is that, in the arguments put forward by Mr Gollnisch, there is no indication whatsoever of fumus persecutionis. 
Being unable to accept the consequences of his remarks, Mr Gollnisch claims to be a victim of petty political proceedings designed to remove him from the political scene. That is a bit rich when viewed in the light of the extremely shocking remarks he made in, I am convinced, full knowledge of the blows he was dealing to our democracy.

Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, from a personal point of view and, above all, on behalf of the Socialist Group in the European Parliament, I am delighted by the outcome of the vote in the Committee on Civil Liberties, Justice and Home Affairs, for it has enabled substantial improvements to be made to the draft report that we had initially. It is, in actual fact, an issue on which we need to have a common approach. It is no longer possible to continue carrying out isolated policies on these matters. We believe that an economic migration policy goes hand in hand with an integration policy. We are also keen to point out that immigration can be a positive factor for the European Union. Other ideas of which we are in favour are introducing a European green card, which would make it easier for immigrants to find jobs, and granting immigrants who have lived on EU territory for at least five years the right to vote in local and European elections but not, by any means, in national elections, contrary to what Mrs Klamt said a few weeks ago. We would point out that regularisations have enabled men and women who were exploited by unscrupulous employers while working illegally to emerge from the shadows. Finally, we would point out the need to develop genuine integration policies. In short, it is a question of finding a means to deal with an indisputable fact: Europe’s population is ageing and, consequently, a new workforce is required. Admittedly, we are only talking here about an own-initiative report following on from a Green Paper, but these are – and I emphasise this fact – so many altogether crucial factors which really are supported by the majority of this House and which therefore ought to be looked at more closely by the Commission, when it drafts its proposal on this matter. Only a few moments ago, Mr Frattini informed us of a draft action plan. I hope that he will take account of these altogether crucial factors. Legislation drafted on such an important subject would be worthy of the European Parliament’s full involvement, for today it is our responsibility – I would even say our duty – finally to give our opinion in favour of a common policy on legal migration. Let us not forget that, by completely putting a stop to legal channels of immigration, we are only contributing to the rise in illegal immigration. Let us be totally honest and acknowledge that, until now, all of the policies solely and exclusively founded on repression have failed and that we might have to accept the need to do things differently and, in particular, increase development in immigrants’ countries of origin. It is by doing this, above all, that we will succeed in reducing the migratory pressure of which these countries are the source.

Mr President, I wanted to begin by congratulating Mrs Buitenweg on her excellent report. I believe she has demonstrated perfectly why issues of freedom and justice cannot be separated from those of security. Today is the opportunity –
 thanks to this report, by the way – 
to redress the balance, because for several years the repressive face of justice and home affairs has been the more fully developed side of the policy and even, in some respects, the only developed side. It is absolutely indispensable that we go still further today and ensure that the extradition system applies, without loss of respect for individual rights, to all suspects, including those suspected of crimes relating to terrorism. Moreover, we need a corrective mechanism for any cases where a national judicial system does not meet the minimum standards. This type of measure would serve to give more substance to the right to a fair trial, a principle enshrined in the European Convention on Human Rights. As was said a short time ago, such a mechanism would be an essential and long-overdue complement to the European arrest warrant. Let us remember –
 especially in view of a number of rather shocking observations we have heard – 
that it is not a matter of mollycoddling criminals but of increasing confidence in all our legal systems so as to encourage Member States to work together. It is an absolutely indispensable step in the direction of greater mutual trust between Member States and towards the principle of mutual recognition of judicial decisions. It is an essential condition for the construction of a European judicial area, to which all of us, I am sure, are firmly committed.

Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, may I begin by congratulating the rapporteur on his excellent report and thanking him for the fruitful cooperation which enabled us to work out a number of compromises together so as to arrive at this draft, which I hope the House will approve on Wednesday. Let me re-emphasise that our aim here is to rectify the shortcomings arising from the mismatch between the present structure of CEPOL and the tasks assigned to it, namely the primary task of increasing knowledge of the national police systems and structures of other Member States, then the task of harmonising police working methods and finally that of devising more effective policing practices. I am aware of the divergences on this matter within the Council, which are regrettably numerous and are compounded by the extreme sensitivity of the Member States whenever a European initiative affects even the tiniest fraction of their sovereign powers, notwithstanding their common aim of greater efficiency in the fight against cross-border crime. I therefore know that it will be very difficult to achieve that aim. Accordingly, I am under few illusions as to the fate that awaits this opinion of the European Parliament at the hands of the Council, since Parliament – alas – still has a purely consultative role. We shall have to wait for some time before any further progress can be made in this field. We should be helped in this respect by the European Constitution, which I sincerely hope will be ratified. While we are waiting, however, I ask the Council to make every possible effort to make police training a genuine Community responsibility, because this is the only way for us to ensure optimum security for the European people, who are confronted daily by acts of violence and other crimes with a steadily increasing supranational dimension.

 Despite the fact that pressure brought to bear on Mr Barroso by the Socialist Group in the European Parliament resulted in a climb-down on his part after he had presented his first Commission in October, I do not believe that the changes he has since made are anywhere near substantial enough to allow me to lend him my support. This is why I have voted against the investiture of the Commission he has put forward. In contrast to the majority of members of the Socialist Group, my ‘no’ to the minimally reshuffled Barroso Commission, as well as that of my delegation as a whole, is an indication of my refusal to hand a blank cheque to a Commission which does not share my values of tolerance, pluralism and freedoms and which has made clear its free-market and conservative leanings. It will now be necessary for us to remain on our guard, given that Mrs Kroes will be responsible for competition and Mrs Fischer Boel for agriculture, meaning that there is a serious risk that conflicts of interest might arise within the European Commission, and given that Mr Frattini, Mr Berlusconi’s ambassador for justice and freedom, will also be a member of this Commission.

 Mr President, on the eve of this most important, not to say crucial, Council concerning the construction of the European judicial area, I should like firstly to express a wish: that there finally be a genuine debate with the Council and that the Council finally listen to what the European Parliament is saying. My main aim in addressing this House is to inform you of our basic demands in the light of our new political agenda. Firstly, I think it essential that a genuinely proactive policy on legal immigration finally be adopted. As, moreover, Mr Vitorino sincerely acknowledged a few minutes ago, it has, until now, been mainly the repressive side of asylum and immigration policy that has been given prominence and, as a result, many aspects of this legal immigration policy have been left on one side. Matters absolutely cannot continue in this way. Allow me to say a few words about the plan to construct, at the gates of Europe, so-called assistance centres for refugees, which are out-and-out camps. Let me tell you how totally opposed I am to such a project. It would in fact be an unprecedented retrograde step in Europe’s exercise of its responsibilities towards populations fleeing from conflicts and would show complete contempt for human rights, something that is absolutely unacceptable. Nor, certainly, can we be reassured by the recent declarations made by the Commissioner-designate, Mr Buttiglione, nor, for that matter, by those I have heard made this evening by Mrs Klamt. Beyond the strict rules for administering migratory flows, there are equally elementary rules concerning respect for individual rights. On the subject of the priority given to the fight against terrorism, there is of course agreement concerning the basis and essential features of this fight, but there are two things we expect from the Council. The first is that it implements genuinely effective measures that go beyond mere statements of intent in the manner of the appointment, following the Madrid bombings, of Mr de Vries who was provided with no resources for taking action. Secondly, we want the fight against terrorism to involve seeking a balance between people’s security and people’s freedom and for us not to imitate our American friends who, in their battle against the terrorist enemy, flout the most fundamental of essential rights. I shall conclude by saying that the demands we are making seem to us to be absolutely indispensable and that we hope that the next Justice and Home Affairs Council will finally give these demands a genuine hearing.

Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, as has already been said, in 1999 the European Union adopted a directive banning asbestos from 1 January 2005, but permitting a derogation for diaphragms used for existing electrolysis cells until they reached the end of their service life. This derogation, which had to be re-examined before 1 January, was intended to enable the companies concerned to make plans to stop using asbestos. Here we are today, with an 18-month delay; it is therefore time that we made progress. It is true that, as part of the review of Annex XVII to REACH, the Commission is proposing to extend the current ban on the use and marketing of asbestos fibres and products containing these fibres, but it is maintaining the option for asbestos to be used in factory-based electrolysis installations, with no time limit imposed, even though asbestos-free alternatives do exist and are used by many companies. Moreover, the Commission is adopting a provision that permits the placing on the market of articles containing asbestos in accordance with a system that could vary from one country to another. This is unacceptable, since the use of this product is responsible for a large number of illnesses linked to exposure to asbestos fibres. Furthermore, the number of people succumbing to these illnesses is likely to continue to rise over the next few years, as this product was still being used up until a few years ago. The effects of asbestos on health have long been known. I would add that the Commission’s decision undermines certain REACH provisions, not least the principle of substitution; it is a bad signal that has been sent out to the other companies. The current economic crisis cannot justify this extension. Furthermore, this position of the Commission’s, which has the backing of a majority of Member States at the Council, is inconsistent with the European Union’s position, which aims to introduce a worldwide ban on asbestos. I have one last point before I finish: the European Trade Union Confederation is today maintaining that it was not consulted on the matter and is suggesting that only the opinion of certain companies was heard and taken on board. The Commission, for its part, is claiming the opposite. Could you shed some light on this point for us?

 Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, as draftsman of the opinion of the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Food Safety, I should like to thank Mr Silva Peneda for having detailed in his report the fact that the Commission was not proposing concrete measures to offset the social and health consequences of the ecological and climate crises. I should also like to thank him for having mentioned the social economy, although I regret that its role in relation to cohesion policy and the creation of quality and non­relocatable employment has not been highlighted. On the eve of the European elections, this report would have been more welcome if certain objectives were not suffering from a clear lack of ambition. Can we be content with flexicurity, and with minimum standards in relation to labour law? No we cannot. We should be worried however, that tomorrow, the right may reject these minimum standards, in the same way that for the last five years they have rejected a directive on services of general interest. Will we finally approve a minimum wage tomorrow? The European citizens have been demanding a strong social Europe for years. The next Parliament must be able to put into practice the various social advancements proposed in the report. I hope that this will help to mobilise everyone on 7 June.

 I voted against the report on cross-border health services as it meets neither the EU objective on a high level of health, in accordance with Article 152 of the Treaty, nor the demand of European citizens to be able to enjoy safe, quality healthcare, close to home. The report does not make prior authorisation the rule for being able to receive treatment in another Member State of the EU. Prior authorisation allows the financial equilibrium of the social systems to be managed, whilst giving patients guaranteed conditions for reimbursement and the information they require before receiving any hospital treatment abroad. It is not acceptable, either, that improvement in the quality of health care should be achieved by making treatment providers compete, or to argue the principle of the free movement of patients: the latter depends above all on their state of health. The amendments adopted are too vague, opening the way to problems being settled by the European Court of Justice. This directive only reinforces health inequalities between Europe’s citizens, as only those who can pay health costs in advance will be able to choose quality services.

 Madam President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, it always surprises me when health matters are handled by the Directorate-General for Enterprise and Industry. On reading the proposals on patient information, however, it soon becomes apparent that, one or two nuances aside, they treat medicines as if they were any other consumer product. On this issue, I believe that information provided by the industry itself, other than labelling and statutory notices, is called advertising and it is by repetition that it becomes a competitive commercial asset. The Commission may well put forward certain provisions to define its proposals, and it may keep telling us that it is patient associations that are impatiently awaiting such provisions. There are many of us who are not fooled by the impact of this ‘patient information’ directive and know that it will have no benefit in actually improving the health of Europeans. We can already be certain that, if the text were to be adopted, the pharmaceutical industry’s marketing budget would skyrocket, undoubtedly at the expense of research. Already today, 23% of turnover is dedicated to advertising and only 17% to research, and if we look at the United States and New Zealand, where this advertising information is already permitted, we can see that it has led to an increase in the number of prescriptions and health costs, without any visible improvement in the quality of care or in citizens’ health. Let this be a lesson to us. Finally, I would like to conclude by saying that a modern solution would be to have more faith in health professionals, or to train them better, so that they can provide information on treatments and prescription medicines.

Madam President, Commissioners, firstly I should like to thank the rapporteurs. We are conscious today that, although plant protection products have enabled a significant increase in agricultural production, in some instances they also have a very negative impact on health and the environment. That is why, aside from the legislation that will be put in place, there is also an urgent need for an epidemiological register making it possible to measure the impact caused by the use of various pesticides according to the way in which professionals and their families, and, of course, consumers, are exposed to them. In certain regions a particularly rapid increase in various types of cancer has actually been observed. Children of users and, in particular, of farmers, are also affected. Aside from this crucial issue of people’s health, it is also the impact on the environment that should be measured. We are already aware of the harmful effects of certain chemical substances on groundwater and rivers. I might also add, on this issue, that I do not believe that the proposal to refer the buffer-zone matter to the various national arbiters is a satisfactory solution. Rather, I believe that the Commission will have to be extremely vigilant regarding this issue. Today we are also seeing an increase in soil erosion, which could jeopardise the agricultural use of many areas of land across the European Union in the decades to come. The fertility of this land is greatly diminishing. The European Union is reacting to confront these risks; that is good, but it should also support farmers in a move to reduce, if not eliminate, harmful pesticides. The future common agricultural policy should integrate this objective and take better account financially of the link between high-quality production and agriculture. Research into agronomy and ecotoxicology, as well as training for farmers, should be used to support new production methods and should be adapted to the specific characteristics of the territories. I shall conclude simply by quoting the title of a film that has just come out, which concerns the theme of this evening and which is called: ‘Demain nos enfants nous accuserons
’ [Tomorrow our children will accuse us].

 I abstained from voting on the ‘CO2
 from passenger cars’ report, since I feel that it does not take sufficient account of the impact the vehicle fleet has on climate change. More ambitious targets, such as those adopted within the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Food Safety of the European Parliament, should have been upheld. These targets could not have negative effects on the European automotive industry. The poor car sales figures recorded this year are, above all, linked to the purchasing power of French and European citizens, but certainly not to a piece of legislation, which, for that matter, is no longer in force. Furthermore, we must not forget that some fines will be returned to automotive companies to help finance their research programmes.

Madam President, an agreement has been reached on the climate package, and we are all relieved about that. However, allow me to tone down the enthusiasm that some have for this package. An agreement was a necessary requirement for envisaging what would happen post-Kyoto, but not sufficient to say that now we are in a position to take up the challenge of climate change. I also think that this text has several weak points. Firstly, I find it regrettable that the level of auctioning has been brought down to 70% in 2020, while the initial proposal was 100%. Secondly, by accepting that 50% of the reduction efforts can be compensated for by projects in developing countries, we are significantly reducing the European Union’s responsibility in terms of climate change. The third example is the low level of revenue and the lack of firm commitments to invest in the fight against climate change, either within the European Union or to benefit developing countries. I doubt that these provisions, and more broadly those in the energy and climate package, will encourage the European economy to make the necessary changes and put the European Union on the road towards a society that is abstemious in terms of carbon. We will nevertheless vote in favour of the whole text, but I think that we will need further initiatives to give more weight to the European commitment.

 Mr President, Commissioner, Minister, two crucial elements have led the European Parliament to review its legislation on the safety of toys: the significant number of toys presenting safety problems that were recalled a year ago, and the studies demonstrating the impact of chemical substances on children’s health. Unfortunately the legislation that we are being asked to adopt today is no match for the issues at stake, and I do not share the enthusiasm of the previous speakers. Indeed, I regret that we have given up being more demanding on several points and, above all, on the presence of chemical substances and allergenic fragrances. I repeat: children are among the most vulnerable people in society, and their fast-developing organisms are fragile. The various standards on chemical substances do not take this into account. Why have CMR chemical substances been only partially banned? Why have not endocrine disruptors been banned? Why have so many derogations been accepted? I also regret the reintroduction of heavy metals. I do not understand how cadmium and lead can be banned in certain goods but permitted in toys, when we know how children use them. My second point concerns market monitoring. The precautionary principle as it is introduced in the directive applies to the Member States, but what scope does it really have for manufacturers? A further problem is that information for consumers must be in a language or languages that they can easily understand, but we do not know whether they will be able to receive information in their mother tongue or in the language of their country. Why remain so vague on the return or recall measures with provisions that are not really suitable for urgent situations? Why reject the idea of an independent third party certifying manufacturers? The Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Food Safety voted in favour of the amendments that took greater account of the health and safety of children.
 I regret that it has not received more support.

Mr President, Commissioner, rapporteur, ladies and gentlemen, I would first of all like to congratulate the rapporteur on his work, which has improved on the initial text. This White Paper proposed by the Commission is a first step in setting clear and beneficial objectives in the field of health, but it is unfortunate that it does not respond to the challenges of quality healthcare and equal access. The report on the table today has not taken over the initial proposals concerning self-medication and that is a good thing. In my opinion, trivialising or even encouraging self-medication is totally inappropriate in terms of the healthcare we must strive towards. ‘Together for Health’ must not become ‘every man for himself in times of illness’. The introduction of the idea of an active patient is a worrying concept: because it is not accompanied by a clear definition, the door is left open to different interpretations. Encouraging patients to take responsibility for their own care and urging population groups to provide their own responses to certain health needs are further proposals that must be treated carefully. We must remember that health is a very specific field that requires a very high level of competence and the issues involved can often be a matter of life and death. The proposals encouraging self-medication, in conjunction with the concept of individual responsibility, do not seem to respond to the health challenge we have to tackle and they move away from the concepts of solidarity. There is one other point that I must criticise: facilitating the mobility of health professionals. This could have very serious consequences on the territorial distribution of health personnel and aggravate what are already very precarious situations in certain Member States. Rather than encouraging the mobility of health professionals, it would be preferable to put the emphasis on the exchange of good health practices among all the Member States. I also recognise that web-based health resources must be encouraged. This is a positive and innovative initiative that is nevertheless only available to a minority of people. I naturally support the amendments tabled by my colleagues concerning health in the workplace. This is a crucial topic because work-related health problems are becoming more and more common.

 Madam President, Mrs Kosciusko-Morizet, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, I too wish to salute the work done by our colleague and the determination she has shown in dealing with this dossier. This is a determination that I share, because the link between environment and health, which is now widely recognised, warrants a response in the shape of our political actions. It is therefore essential to move forward so as to update our knowledge in this area and, more especially, to implement actions designed to limit the negative impact of our environment on human health. The different subject areas have been clearly identified and are covered in the Action Plan. It has been necessary not only to take account of the effects of climate change and to devise methods of risk assessment but also to discuss other factors such as electromagnetic fields. I am also gratified to see that the report contains a reference to the 2007 document produced by the European Environment Agency showing that atmospheric pollutants, and particularly those associated with fine particles and ground-level ozone, represent a considerable threat to the proper development of children and are reducing life expectancy in the EU. However, I regret that the problems associated with health in the work environment have not been included in the text. It should be remembered that millions of people now suffer from illnesses that are linked to their working environment and whose origins are many and varied: stress, work intensity, various pollutants, musculoskeletal disorders associated with poor workplace ergonomics and so on. I hope that this issue will be considered seriously by other committees. As Mrs Ries has said, the biggest problem is also that we are falling behind. The Commission, it seems to me, has not been sufficiently active in honouring the commitments that it set itself. Here I would refer, for example, to the issue of nanoparticles, a subject that is currently the focus of numerous reports and one that is raising many questions. For example, I read in the Commission’s 2007 communication on the objectives for 2004-2006 that the intention is to examine the possible effects of nanoparticles on health and the environment. Following that, for the 2007-2010 period there is provision for research into the potential risk that nanoparticles pose for human health. This means three years to look into a subject and another three years to carry out studies. It seems to me that we could be more efficient than this. Doubtless there are reasons for this inadequate approach: lack of human resources and lack of financial means. However, what kind of credibility can the EU expect if it fails to keep to its own commitments? We know that on these issues Europeans can recognise the valued added of the European dimension. Let us therefore not disappoint them. I will finish with a question that is directed at the Council and at the Commission: you referred, Commissioner, to cooperation between the different services and between the research teams, which is a good thing. Is there also coordination between the different national environmental-health plans drawn up at government level and the European Action Plan? Finally, Madam Minister, when you take the floor again, perhaps you can tell us whether France, for example, has linked its efforts to those that it has been making under the environmental Grenelle?

 Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, first of all I should like to thank the Members who contributed to the drafting of this resolution. I would like to stress that this is supported by all the political groups. Why such unanimity? No doubt because it reflects our dissatisfaction with the attitude and approach of the Commission, which stems from a denial of democracy that the European Parliament has faced on this dossier for several weeks now. The Commission’s determination to disregard the opinion of MEPs and experts on the issue of importing chlorinated chicken is truly appalling. Yes, Mr Verheugen is in charge of negotiating with his US counterpart to promote trade between our two regions, but can he do it by sacrificing European health standards? How can the Commission have given the go-ahead for this kind of project, merely proposing compulsory labelling and a review of the provisions in 2 years’ time etc.? Can the Commission explain why, after acknowledging that it lacked information about these substances, it is not adopting a precautionary approach? The absence of references to the conclusions of the US Center for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) is also curious, since a few weeks ago it revealed an increase in contamination and infection from salmonella, listeria and other bacteria. Why should we import a method which has not already been tried and tested? Another important point to remember is that the implementation of European food safety legislation required years of work and collaboration with industry professionals, who agreed to invest in order to meet the expectations of European citizens. This approach, which involves the entire food chain, is the most sustainable way of reducing the level of pathogens. This was the choice we made, and do you really think that a relationship of trust and a strong and reliable partnership can be built by failing to reaffirm our own principles and values to our US partners? I have one more question: would the imported products be subject to the same rules as European poultry? Finally, I will finish by pointing out that this decision is all the more incomprehensible as the European Commission has decided to counterattack the WTO over the decision of its Dispute Settlement Body on hormone-treated beef. I find that there is enormous confusion and misunderstanding among consumers faced with this diametrically opposed position. It really calls into question the political line taken by the European Commission on food health and safety. The European Council will shortly issue an opinion on the Commission’s proposal. We ask it to take into account the position of Parliament and the Standing Committee on the Food Chain and Animal Health: to put health before trade.

Madam President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, for my part I am not satisfied with either the form or the substance of this compromise text. On the form, I believe we cannot do our job properly when, after spending two years working on drawing up a text, we find that the final decisions – which are more than just adjustments – are taken on the quiet and go far beyond what was adopted in the Committee on the Environment and only land on Members’ desks a few hours before the vote. On the substance, this compromise text is a cop-out that fails to give a clear definition of recovery, no longer tries to stabilise the volume of waste, no longer sets out ambitious recycling targets and unfortunately reflects the inability of the Commission and the Council to translate the highly ambitious declarations made at European and international level into actions. No, I am not satisfied, and I am in fact concerned at our political incapacity to take genuine environmental action or action to improve our health, which is also why I have voted against the text.

I abstained during the final vote on this resolution for the following reasons in particular. The resolution contains positive points, such as the reference to the precautionary principle. However, I cannot support certain proposals and objectives. Although I can accept the principle of a transatlantic market, it will be impossible, and even less desirable, to complete it by 2015. Completing this market implies the elimination of non-tariff barriers (para. 17), i.e. social, health, environmental and other standards. The provisions the EU has adopted in these areas through its legislation provide satisfactory protection for European consumers and citizens, and they must be maintained if not improved. Similarly, labelling and traceability are not enough to enable consumers to make informed choices (para. 28). A consumer protection policy cannot be reduced to this type of measure. Consumers’ choice of agricultural products must also be guaranteed by preventing the contamination of traditional and organic crops by GMOs. Finally, as regards the import of American poultry treated with chlorinated water, the wording in the text is too ambiguous. Imports must be banned if we want to preserve the Community’s food safety policy.

Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, first of all I should like to express particular thanks to the shadow rapporteurs and the draftsmen of opinions for their valuable assistance. Today we can be satisfied with the balanced report adopted in the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Food Safety, which is the result of joint efforts. The European Union is unquestionably committed to the environment, both internally and at international level. Having set a number of objectives in order to meet the urgent environmental needs facing us, the European Union has to devise ways of achieving them. To do that, it has, over the years, adopted legislation that is regularly revised and applicable in the Union. It invests in research, raises public awareness and encourages good practice by the Member States. Now we are suggesting looking at another possibility, that of market-based instruments. The report is based on the Commission paper, which contains a number of proposals and ideas that I welcome. Firstly, it endeavours to improve on a text that, in my view, focuses a little too much on climate change. That is certainly a crucial issue, but we must not ignore the whole picture, all the fields of human activity whose impact on the environment is also very important. Furthermore, I did not, unfortunately have any information from the consultation that might have helped us in our work. In the Green Paper, the Commission is proposing to achieve the environmental targets at a lower and a reasonable cost. That should be possible with the economic instruments which are, moreover, a flexible way of achieving the aims set. Finally, the report suggests that the Commission should draw up an action plan or other system for a market-based instrument for the environment. I have a question for the Commission: can it tell us what stage it has reached in its discussions and whether the consultation results available to it at the moment will reinforce or amend the proposals in the Green Paper? I believe that is a very important question. As regards the implementation of the market-based instruments, we must be guided by certain principles. We must, of course, apply the 'polluter pays' principle, ensure that the market-based instruments complement each other and complement other instruments, and that they are consistent and appropriate to the areas covered. That is the aim. In other words, we must not be systematic, but must show a great deal of ingenuity. With regard to specific instruments, which I do not have time to discuss here, I must emphasise that Parliament is sceptical about the proposal on biodiversity, for the simple reason that it seems to us difficult, if not impossible, to compensate for a fairly unusual ecosystem in another country. As for internalisation of the costs, that is a principle on which we have to base ourselves and for which we have to take steps. At the moment, very little account is taken of the environmental costs of human activities, particularly industrial and economic activities, in other words, to use a more technical term, the external costs. The transport sector is a typical example. I note that last June the Commission was to put forward a proposal for revision of the 'Eurovignette' directive, particularly by making the road transport charge variable. That principle of variability must be applied more and more when devising market-based instruments for the environment. The Commission is proposing a similar system for energy taxes, in which they would be made up of two components, an energy component and an environmental component. If the revision of the directive achieves its purpose, it should also ensure that competitiveness with other means of transport is restored and that modes that emit less CO2 
are used. Finally, there is one point to which I should like to draw particular attention: the competitiveness of the European economy. Of course we agree on this, but we have to be careful. The question that arises here is whether inaction would have a social, economic and environmental cost, as well as a political cost.

Thank you, Commissioner, thank you, ladies and gentlemen, for your very thorough and interesting contributions. We appreciate that the taxation debate is not closed and I should like just to mention three points at this stage in the discussions. Firstly, the proportion accounted for by energy taxes. On average they represent 76% of environmental taxation, compared with 21% for transport. Secondly, domestic consumers, who have to pay by far the largest proportion of environmental taxes, when other sectors of the economy are the biggest consumers of energy, water and transport. Thirdly, the proportion of GDP of Member States represented by environmental taxes has declined over the past five years. That gives us something else to think about in our future deliberations. I certainly regret what the EPP is asking for on paragraph 26, in which we were proposing a minimum Community tax on CO2
. It seems to me that we need to continue along that path if we want to prevent dumping in the European Union. The idea is not to take over tax powers from the Member States, it is to have minimum tax harmonisation. That is necessary and it has been underlined. Apart from the fact that Member States are asking for further progress towards tax coordination, I should also like to draw attention to another point in the report. The reduction in taxes on employment cannot be linked only to the reduction in environmental taxes, as the Commission is proposing. In my view, it should be part of a more general reform, with principles of solidarity and social justice. I am well aware that that is not yet a competence of the States, but let us think about it here and give the Member States some information. The final point that I think is important is the domestic dimension. The measures we take here should not have an adverse effect on households that are already on low incomes and make the position of other households more insecure. That is what I wanted to say in conclusion. Thank you, Commissioner; I can assure you of our support in drawing up future legislation on these matters.

Mr President, Commissioner, Minister, ladies and gentlemen, the Committee on the Environment has adopted a very good resolution and I hope that the European Commission and the Member States will take account of the various recommendations it contains, notably the call for leadership and conviction at the Bonn Conference, but also for efforts within its territory to halt the loss of biodiversity in the European Union by 2010. I would like to talk about three of the points raised in the resolution. The first is the issue of biofuels, and some of my fellow Members have already mentioned this. They have a considerable environmental impact on forests and on agricultural land, and the impact of their development on food resources will continue to grow. There should be no competition between agricultural products intended for food and those intended for industry, be they for the production of biofuels or for the agrochemical industry. The link between food and agriculture must be clearly established. The next point relates to marine biodiversity. We have been very slow in dealing with this issue. I fully support the calls in the resolution for rapid action, notably to establish marine protected areas. The final point concerns GMOs. We now have studies that demonstrate their negative impact on the environment and on the soil in particular. We know that dissemination of GMOs results in pollution of traditional crops, which hinders the preservation of biodiversity. In addition, the industrial concentration in the seeds sector and the fact that they are controlled by a few multinationals are a cause for concern. This is a situation that the Commission and the Member States must not neglect. Finally, the Conference of the Parties in Curitiba, Brazil in March 2006 decided to maintain the moratorium on terminator seeds. That was an excellent decision, but now we might want to consider whether the moratorium is sufficient and whether we should perhaps prohibit the use of these types of single-use GM seeds. What do the Commission and the Member States intend to do in relation to these points at the Conference of the Parties in Bonn? Have you already an idea of the sustainability criteria concerning biofuels that could be presented in Bonn?

 Mr President, Commissioner, I should first like to congratulate Mr Adamou on his work. If one of the objectives of this report is to break down the barriers to organ donation and to ensure the safety of organ transplantation, the first problem clearly concerns self-sufficiency within each Member State and within the European Union. Organ shortage is a problem facing all the Member States to varying degrees. Whilst this situation, which has tragic consequences for people who are waiting for an organ transplant, may be one of the causes of organ trafficking, it is not the only one. It appears that the root cause of trafficking in human organs is their market value. To remedy this situation, at least within the European Union, organ donation must be guided by three basic principles: it must be unpaid, voluntary and anonymous. If commercialisation of human organs is not possible, then trafficking will be more difficult. In an attempt to resolve this fundamental problem of organ shortage, as highlighted in the report, it is necessary not only to conduct effective public awareness campaigns but also to raise awareness among potential donors. Some Member States are already leading the way on this issue. It should be noted that, in the case of the donation of blood, which is also in short supply in Europe, several years ago now, we called on every Member State to conduct blood donation campaigns. What was the outcome of this request? Can we build on this experience and extend it, and possibly improve it, to include organ donation? Nevertheless, I would like to emphasise a couple of points which worry me: firstly, the donor card is not fit for purpose, and, secondly, the issue of the living donor needs to be regulated more effectively. These two points highlight the central role to be played by doctors and surgeons. Finally, the report refers to the various possibilities of treatment available using adult stem cells. I should also like to mention the opportunities offered by the use of umbilical cord blood stem cells in the treatment of blood cancer, as a substitute for bone marrow transplants. Let us not dismiss this approach. I already mentioned it at your hearing, Commissioner.

Madam President, Commissioners, ladies and gentlemen, all the health and environmental data now available, which I do not propose to list this evening, must necessarily prompt this House to take decisive action on pesticides and their conditions of use. It is essential that such action is based on measurable targets. It became clear in the discussions prior to the vote in plenary that there are major differences between the Member States in both their practice and their policy approach, so we ended up compromising on certain issues and relying on subsidiarity. I hope we shall not be deceived here by subsidiarity, for it will entail flexibility that could easily become a pretext for watering down our policies to a very minimal expression of the political and public will being voiced here today, particularly on the issues of exposure to risks and the extent of the buffer zones beside watercourses. If subsidiarity is to be meaningful in relation to pesticides, it must encourage more comprehensive thinking about the agricultural and environmental issues in each European region. That will mean stepping up research and the transfer of technologies; involving all the stakeholders, including farmers, researchers, NGOs, health professionals and representatives of the food industry; and carrying out thorough research in each geographical area, jointly identifying best practices and non-chemical alternatives that are suited to the soil, the climate and the crops. There are a few regions in which this work is already being done. I therefore propose that the Commission should encourage the introduction of such an approach and should facilitate inter-regional exchanges of experience, whilst at the same time ensuring that European laws are properly applied.

 Mr President, Commissioners, ladies and gentlemen, there are countless unscrupulous manufacturers and company directors around the world who trade within the WTO. They do not care about the environment any more than about the health of their employees and customers, or that these may be children. For them, profits must be had at any price. These are not just Chinese companies and they do not just sell toys. They must be confronted with institutions and legislation capable of blocking their fraudulent – even criminal – practices. We have to recognise the weakness of our control systems and question the meaning of CE marking on products marketed in Europe. This marking should mean that products comply with European legislation and not that they might comply with them, which is misleading for consumers. CE marking is pointless if it is not based on genuine product safety. This is what European consumers demand, just as they demand that their health be put before market interests. To this end, the European Union must be firmer in its negotiations with the WTO.

Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, I should like first of all to thank Mr Adamou for his report and to welcome the measures and actions that he presents in it. Those measures are many and varied, but it seems to me that, today, things would be clearer and more effective if we organised our priorities into a hierarchy and if we targeted the most urgent matters, even if it is not easy to do so. Indeed, as we fall further and further behind in applying our decisions, the measures to be implemented are, for their part, becoming ever more numerous and necessary. We also know that, when it comes to the environment, everything is interwoven. It was almost two decades ago that we realised that we had reached the limits of the biosphere and that we were at a standstill. And yet, we are not taking in practice the strong decisions that we advocate in our texts, in spite of the increasingly alarming prospects before us. Protection of biodiversity, as has been said, must take place at all levels of public policy: transport, agriculture, territorial planning, tourism, fisheries, and so on. We know this too, and yet Cardiff is well and truly buried in the drawers of the Commission. Let us hope that, as part of the work to be carried out within the temporary committee on climate change, the cause and effect link that exists between this phenomenon and the loss of biodiversity will make progress possible. Finally, I should like to highlight a specific point in Mr Adamou’s report regarding GMOs. I strongly support the request put to the Commission to evaluate the impact of GMOs on ecosystems and the potential risks that they carry where biodiversity is concerned. Let us not forget that human beings are part of biodiversity. So, as you just said, Mr Borg, and, since we are playing from the same score in this House this evening, let us act, let us implement our action plan and let the European Union finally set an example!

Mr President, I should like to begin by congratulating Mr Hasse Ferreira on the quality of his report and on the crucial points that it contains. I should also like to recall how the people of Europe joined forces, a year ago, when the vote was held on the Services Directive. Their action led to the text being developed and to our institutions changing position in terms of their willingness to liberalise all services, irrespective of the missions and needs that they represent. We now need to echo these citizens’ opinions and the values that they hold dear and that we share and to which our rapporteur is giving substance. The tasks fulfilled by SSGIs serve human rights, human dignity, the general interest and social cohesion and, hence, are fully in line with the Charter of Fundamental Rights. Refusing to acknowledge that and perpetuating the confusion between the notions of economic service and market service, as the Commission is doing, means giving up on Europe’s special social quality and on what it represents for millions of Europeans. Specific legislation is required in order to ensure that people’s right to these services is respected and that they are indeed carried out.

Madam President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, faced with the continual increase in waste that we are producing and with the need to revise the 1975 text, the European Commission proposed, last year, to amend the framework directive in force. The intention was good, but the legislative proposal is unequal to the challenges and is well below the objectives that must be attained. The measures proposed in relation to the prevention of waste and, thus, to the reduction of the volumes produced are not very practical, and none are binding. Equally, I regret the absence of quantified targets for recycling. Moreover, the Commission proposals on hazardous waste are inadequate when compared with the Community legislation in force. The objective of merging the texts in order to simplify them and to improve their implementation must not mean the provisions on the treatment of hazardous waste being toned down. When it comes to waste, no toning down can be tolerated, and even less so when the waste is hazardous. Recent events encourage us to be vigilant. When hazardous waste is mixed with other waste, it does not become any less dangerous. Equally, we cannot support the possibility of derogations from the obligation to hold an operating permit when having to deal with hazardous waste. As regards the concept of using waste as an energy source, I understand the aim, but it is dangerous to confuse energy exploitation with energy recovery. There is nothing stopping us from recovering energy generated during incineration operations even if incineration is classed as a disposal operation. This is a point requiring clarification. A proposal such as this, which enables incineration to be classed as a recovery operation and no longer just as a disposal operation, puts waste recovery and energy recovery on the same footing. Above all, though, it contradicts the five-step hierarchy adopted by the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Food Safety and, by extension, the objective of preventing and reducing the production of waste. This objective is backed by Mrs Jackson’s report, which significantly enhances the Commission proposal. The waste issue is a considerable challenge for society, one that warrants ambitious legislation. An increasing number of surveys show us that a large majority of consumers want more environmentally-friendly products, and want to be better informed of the nature and quality of those products. We must listen to them.

 Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, I should firstly very much like to pay tribute to the work of our fellow Member, and I particularly support her proposals on prevention and on education, as well as on physical education of course. These proposals also emphasise the important role of school canteens, which must offer children and adolescents a balanced diet involving healthy produce. Whenever they have been implemented in our countries, these measures have produced satisfactory results, and several studies indicate that such programmes, designed as they are to prevent obesity and to promote healthy eating, have made it possible to stabilise the obesity rate among overweight young people - a rate that, overall, is otherwise constantly increasing. The figures were pointed out just now. That is what leads me to say that we really must urge the Commission to bring such programmes into much more widespread use. That being said, I think it necessary to point out that, confronted by this growing public health problem, we must also turn our attention to its underlying causes. The link between obesity and the social environment has been proved many times, the main reason for the link being the cost of food. A French daily newspaper published an article today entitled ‘The rich are slim’. If obesity is mainly connected with the excessive consumption of sugar and fat, with fruit and vegetables eaten in correspondingly fewer quantities, it is certainly because of the cost of the latter. Moreover, it is hard to see how, in this respect, things might improve in the future, as it is well known that the overhauled common agricultural policy will lead to sugar, and even fat, being placed on the market at 25% of previous prices – a development that would lead to their wider use in products made by the food processing industry – while the prices of fruit and vegetables will continue to rise, leaving them still far beyond the reach of the poorest people. That is why it would be helpful if European Union food policy could complement health policy, with foodstuffs made accessible to everyone and their prices kept down. Nor should the impact of socio-economic policy be ignored, as the choice of food tends to be determined by households’ purchasing power. While waiting, however, for our policies to be revised, we must lose no time in using our food aid programme to ensure that fruit and vegetables can be supplied to those who need them.

With today’s vote, the EU has provided itself with a text, the scope of which is far from achieving the desired objectives. The project was ambitious: to adopt legislation that will enable chemical substances to be registered and evaluated, with an obligation to substitute dangerous products with a less harmful alternative, where one exists. This project has not withstood the pressure of certain lobbies from the chemical industry, strongly supported as it is within the European Parliament, which preferred to invoke economic constraints over environmental and public health protection in order to obtain less binding legislation, particularly on substitution. I also regret the exclusion of endocrine disruptors from the substitution procedure and the fact that the chemical safety report should not be compulsory for substances weighing between one and ten tonnes. The concluded agreement is inadequate, but to reject it would mean running the risk of starting the conciliation procedure and of ending up with a completely meaningless text. As inadequate as it certainly is, this legislation does exist, and on the strength of that alone, it is well worth our getting more involved in terms of demanding financial and human resources to apply this legislation, to take it forward and to guarantee substitution on a very gradual basis.
 Anne Ferreira (PSE

 Mr President, we know that chemical products can be dangerous and have catastrophic effects on health and the environment. It therefore seemed obvious that this text ought to be exemplary, leaving behind economic pressures and political divides. That is why, today, I am dismayed that the long debates have resulted in a compromise that falls short of our expectations and of what was voted for in the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Food Safety. Yes, I am dismayed, and what dismays me in particular is that the principle of substitution, where alternatives exist, has been weakened by the proposal for a substitution plan and a socio-economic report, both of which will delay the replacement of dangerous substances. I hope the Agency will be resolute on these matters. Likewise, I agree with the European Trade Union Confederation. It is very disappointing that the chemical safety report will be mandatory only where production exceeds 10 tonnes, as this will not make for transparency on thousands of substances and will not allow risk management plans to be adopted. Finally, the subtleties expressed over CMR substances, implying that they are less dangerous than might appear, leave me perplexed. I am also dismayed that part of European industry has not immediately wanted to rise to the challenge of innovation and improve its public image. I say part of European industry because I know that some have already anticipated REACH. That is why, today, I can only hope that if the consolidated version of this regulation is adopted on Wednesday it will be implemented with the utmost stringency and the utmost transparency. I will close by thanking Mr Sacconi, whose task was not an easy one.

Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, the Court of Justice is being asked more and more frequently to rule on matters concerning the rights of patients who receive treatment in Member States other than their own, and the resulting case law could take the place of the democratic decisions that our institutions should be taking on this matter. For this reason, I welcome the Commissioner's initiative. My fear, however, is that the rights established through the proposals you are able to make to us will not become effective in practice for want of adequate frameworks in the Member States. I am therefore going to ask you a few questions. How do you intend to realise in practice the universal right to health care to which you referred and equality of access within the European Union, given the well-known gulfs between the health levels and between the health-care structures in individual Member States? We recently reviewed the breast-cancer situation and regrettably reached the collective conclusion that the recommendations made by the European Union on prevention had not been acted upon in some Member States, to the detriment of the patients concerned. As far as obesity is concerned, you indicated yourself a few days ago that, if self-regulation did not work, the European Union would take legislative action. There are also proposals from Members of this House on the question of mental health and on the possibility of legislation in that area. Do you not think that the European Union should take the lead today on health matters? It must show greater ambition and, in particular, raise the general quality of health systems, though not neglecting, of course, the parallel issues, for we are well aware of the adverse effects that poor living conditions can have on people's health.

I voted in favour of the amendment aimed at rejecting the Council common position on the Services Directive. The directive is unsatisfactory because it introduces more confusion and legal uncertainty and further weakens the amended proposal adopted by the European Parliament at first reading, which I voted against. This is particularly the case as regards labour law and the social and public services that have been excluded from the scope of the Services Directive. Above all, however, the Council text gives the Commission the power to oversee the application of the directive. While the country of origin concept has disappeared from the text in the text amended by the Commission, it has not been replaced by the country of destination or host country concept. I find this very harmful, all the more so because it will be the European Court of Justice that settles any disputes that may ensue. It is therefore a liberal Services Directive that has been adopted this 15 November. Three years of debates will not have made it possible to avoid a conclusion with dangerous consequences for political and social Europe. This is a harsh blow to European integration – one that it scarcely needed.

 The Conference of the Parties in Montreal last year concluded with the minimal decision to continue discussions on the Kyoto Protocol and its objectives after 2012. On the eve of the next annual conference, the situation is still just as uncertain, and it therefore presents a serious threat to the future of the Kyoto Protocol, particularly in the wake of the statements by the new Canadian Government. This situation is incomprehensible and unacceptable given that the warning signs are continuing to multiply and that forecasts are certain of a 50% increase in CO2 emissions by 2030, which runs counter to the objectives in this matter, to which our institution refers on a regular basis. There is a very broad consensus within the European Union, as the European Trade Union Confederation (ETUC) has lent its support to some very ambitious objectives to combat climate change. We must act as a matter of urgency, and take decisions and measures that match the challenges facing Europe and the whole world. Our response to those challenges represents a powerful driving force for research and technological innovation, and for the modernisation of our production facilities.

 Madam President, Commissioners, I should like to start by thanking my fellow Members for their hard work and for the clarity of their comments. The problem we are discussing today is a serious one: one only needs to look at the alarming statistics on the occurrence of breast cancer in Europe and to see the number of deaths caused by this disease to be convinced of that. This problem is made all the more serious by the fact that there are major inequalities between countries with regard to both the prevention and the treatment of cancer, and these inequalities have become even more pronounced since the last enlargement. Although the Treaties state that, in conjunction with the Member States, the European Union shall work to protect and promote the health of European citizens, we nevertheless need to give greater emphasis to the phrase 'in conjunction', because the EU's guidelines and recommendations have not been taken sufficiently into account. We now need to respond to this state of affairs, and not continue to tolerate it. The European Union must ensure that its citizens have equal access to the detection and management of the disease, and to the best available treatments. We can do this by legislative and budgetary means, as well as through the Structural Funds and research programmes. We must channel all the resources necessary to research all the causes of this disease, be they environmental, social or genetic, and to undertake research into innovative treatments. The Commission needs to present us with some proposals in this regard, and I really do think that the European Union should make the fight against breast cancer, and against cancer in general, a political priority, because together we will always be stronger. This is the added value of the European Union that the people of Europe expect. Studies, diagnostics, evaluations and resolutions are all necessary, but action is absolutely vital. The Commission and the Council should therefore heed our warning cry and lose no more time.

 Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, firstly, please accept Mrs Lienemann’s sincere apologies for being unable to attend this evening, as you are all aware of her commitment to this matter. It is, however, with the same pleasure and the same convictions that I take her place. I would like to remind you of all the support that our group offers to Mrs Isler Béguin's report and to pay tribute to the agreement reached by our political groups on an ambitious strategy to consolidate the only direct financial instrument intended for European environment policies. It should also be emphasised that it is our Parliament that obtained additional budgetary credits for LIFE, although well below our initial aims. Today, it is once again MEPs who are calling for strengthened resources to support the implementation of the Natura Directive. An effort has been made, undoubtedly insufficient, but obtained in a tight budgetary situation within which we must work. Our disagreements, as matters stand with this issue, concern the method chosen for financing activities. LIFE is an exemplary European instrument. It has proved itself, and we cannot accept that this policy should be renationalised, as planned, with the management of 80% of its budget delegated to the Member States. The European Union must not content itself with handing out money, it must hold the reins of this environmental policy. At a time when the European idea needs to be safeguarded, and given that this is a policy largely supported by EU citizens, it is unacceptable to undermine the European dynamic in this way. Our credibility in the eyes of Europeans is at stake following the statements in the future sustainable development strategy. Moreover, LIFE must retain its exemplary status, which is founded on the choice of innovative and reproducible projects. It is clear that we must guarantee Member States the level of funding that they expect, while requiring that the selection of projects is informed by a double rationale: one involving the European dimension and meaningful environmental practice. Our group supports Mrs Haug's amendment calling on the Commission to guarantee continued funding for programmes now under way. Indeed, we cannot accept that NGOs and other parties involved in LIFE should be penalised.

 I voted against Mr Rapkay's report for the following reasons. First of all, the Commission is not requested to propose a framework directive on services of general interest. There is now a threat hanging over administrations, mixed-economy societies and inter-communal structures, due to the risk of disputes in the name of competition law. Mr Barroso made no mistake when, during the debate in plenary, he observed that there was no consensus on a proposal for a framework directive. By refusing to define services of general interest and the specific law applicable to them, the Commission is leaving public services subject to the rules of the market, and hence to competition law. Now is no longer the time to publish yet another communication, or to put forward new sectoral proposals. We expect the Commission to respect Parliament's decisions and to proceed as soon as possible to an evaluation of the liberalisation policies being pursued. We know that the results are a long way off the published objectives. This resolution does not look at services of general interest as a fundamental pillar of the European social model, or as a means of achieving the EU's objectives in terms of society, the economy, the environment and territorial cohesion.

 Clean air for the citizens, their health and their quality of life is a good intention. Unfortunately, the report which we have just adopted is not up to the task. This text falls short of World Health Organisation recommendations and lacks the necessary urgency. PM2.5 are the finest particles and the ones most dangerous to the body; that is why the limit should not be more than 12 micrograms. Moreover, the implementation periods, extending as they do to 2015, do not reflect the seriousness of the problem and it is unacceptable that there should also be exemptions. I also deplore the fact that this first reading was the direct result of compromise between the political groups, preventing Parliament from working properly and locking us into a position that falls far short of our political objectives. Lastly, this report does not reflect the ambitions we have nevertheless clearly expressed in environmental matters, both in the international arena and to the European public.

 Madam President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, the organisation of healthcare in the Member States is based upon solidarity through hospital networks, social security systems and mutual insurance schemes. The pharmaceutical industry, however, selects its patients on the basis of their resources – I am thinking of the diseases of poor countries – or on the basis of the numbers of patients involved. That is why we now have to legislate on the question of medicinal products for paediatric use. We welcome the fact that this report will be adopted tomorrow, as we all want children to have medication appropriate to their age and medical condition without delay. Having said that, I regret – and Mrs Grossetête has also pointed this out – that the two-year period for marketing a medicinal product has been maintained, and, moreover, I regret that the amendment intended to cut that period has not been supported. I also regret the long delay in obtaining an inventory of needs for paediatric treatments. These delays belie the declarations of urgency made here in Parliament. Finally, in relation to the provisions on risk management and pharmacovigilance, we must be careful to ensure they are properly implemented and, if necessary, be ready to amend our text.

Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, firstly I should like, as other Members have done, to express my approval of the decision not to merge the health and consumer protection areas of the Community action plan within the field of health and consumer protection. Quite apart from the different nature of the European Union’s competences in these two fields, health policy cannot be regarded as a consumer good. Although I support the introduction of ‘e-Health’, this must not be used to provide a covert means of testing out an information policy. I thank Mr Trakatellis for proposing a considerable increase in the budget allocation for this programme, an increase that is necessary if we are to see our objectives and actions brought to a successful conclusion. More funding would have been preferable in view of the challenges to be faced, but we shall already have cause for a certain satisfaction if the Council agrees to increase the funding allocations for health within the context of the financial perspective for 2007–2013. I wish to emphasise two priorities. Firstly, we must improve cooperation and coordination in the field of health in order to respond more rapidly to cross-border health threats. Had that been the case, we should have been able now to avoid the extent of the spread of the chikungunya epidemic. This ought to prompt the European Union, the Member States and the pharmaceutical laboratories to establish a system for monitoring and for research into these kinds of disease, which may be rare in terms of world population but are catastrophic at a local level. My second priority is this: to achieve the objective of a better standard of health for all Europeans, we must take into account the impact of environmental and social living conditions on health. In order to treat certain illnesses better we have to address the causes. Everyone knows that people who are vulnerable and socially excluded are more prone than others to certain diseases. We have to help the weakest. If the Member States made rapid progress in these two areas, our people would feel a little more protected by the European Union.

I voted in favour of the motion for a resolution on restructuring and employment, which proposes financial resources and an enhanced role for the social partners, as well as tools for analysing and anticipating restructuring. Businesses are restructured for various reasons, sometimes for the purpose of defending them and sometimes in order to make them more combative, but the process always has the same effects on employees, namely that they become the adjustment variable where the strategies of industrial groups are concerned. It is commendable and necessary that the European Union should be looking into this problem with the aim of anticipating the consequences of restructuring for employees, but it is the European Union’s duty to establish an economic and industrial policy that is dynamic and concerned with preserving and creating jobs for Europeans, as well as social and territorial cohesion. I regret, therefore, that the European Union itself encourages competition among the Member States by leaving the path clear for social and fiscal dumping.

 I voted in favour of Mr Hutchinson's report on relocation, which emphasises how urgent it is for the EU to take account of the seriousness of the effects of company relocation on people and regions. We need to shed more light on the course of this phenomenon and on its consequences, and an observatory will enable us to do so. However, this also needs to go through a more restrictive legislative framework within the EU, and the inclusion of social and environmental clauses in international trade. The interests of employees and protecting jobs must be at the heart of our political concerns. This is vital if we are going to achieve the goal of full employment and the objectives of the Lisbon Strategy as recommended in 2000 – we will not be able to achieve these objectives without a European industrial policy.

 Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, I should first like to thank all those who helped improve my report, and I should like to say straightaway that I shall be supporting the amendments tabled by the Group of the Greens/European Free Alliance. It is worth remembering that if all the inhabitants of Earth were to adopt the West’s lifestyle we would need several planets to meet their needs, and that the West, and primarily the EU, is duty-bound to carry out a root-and-branch rethink of its modes of production and consumption. This assessment is undisputed in the Chamber, cutting across traditional political boundaries, and has led the Commission to incorporate sustainable development into the Union’s priorities. The time has come for us to take stock of our actions in this area, and the results so far have been mixed. Progress has been made, but there have been setbacks or, at least, some shortcomings. Under pressure from public concern about the continued degradation of our environment, the EU has worked hard to warn the international community about ecology issues. Assessment of the situation has led to a large amount of rhetoric, but this has not always been followed up by action – far from it. The time has come for action to be taken, because there is an urgent need for a proactive policy aimed at reversing climate change, especially in light of the magnitude of recent natural disasters. I welcome the conclusions of the Montreal conference and the positive role played by EU representatives should not go unmentioned. Whilst the Union has adopted important legislation intended to reduce industrial waste and to make the cars we use more energy efficient and environmentally friendly, the significant increase in road traffic has meant that its efforts have come to nothing. This is a clear illustration of one of the paradoxes facing the EU: on the one hand, the free movement of goods and, on the other, the detrimental impact of the free movement of goods on the EU’s environmental objectives. There are two approaches to addressing this problem: firstly, to encourage the use of more environmentally-friendly means of transport, with the Union providing financial support for large structural projects, and secondly, to incorporate the environmental cost of transport into the price of goods or to tax transport in relation to its environmental impact. There is an urgent need for proactive policy on water. In spite of the laws that have been adopted and the measures that have been taken, the state of water remains unsatisfactory. Do we need to point out once again that chemical pollution levels are still too high? Do we not have a duty to hold certain farming methods responsible, as they are such a major consumer of water and various fertilisers? The forthcoming reform of the CAP should take this into account and press ahead with the reform of grants and environmental cross-compliance. There is an urgent need for a proactive policy to maintain biodiversity. The list does not stop there. There is an urgent need for measures to be taken – such as the reports already adopted, the one by Mrs Ries and the one expected to be adopted on REACH – to offset the negative impact of the environment on health. There is an urgent need to take action on development aid, because inequality on Earth generates more and more conflict and the poorest countries are the first victims of natural disasters. Sustainable development provides part of the answer, because it represents a model of production and consumption that could and should be extended to all countries. The Union needs to be proactive and propose effective measures if it is to be up to the task of reversing the most worrying trends and of preventing irreversible situations from arising. To this end, it is essential that each sector be set quantified objectives and be subject to regular, strictly timetabled, evaluation. On a broader level, the political foundations of the EU must be further strengthened. This entails greater solidarity and more effective coordination; to encourage widespread dumping is incompatible with the requirements of sustainable development. It also entails a breakdown of the implementation of sustainable development at all international, national and local levels. Every legislative proposal would benefit from being viewed from the perspective of sustainable development. We have much to do in this area. Similarly, if we want to move sustainable development forward, we should no longer accept that the legal basis for draft laws on the environment or health should be the sacred cow of the free movement of goods. The Commission has a responsibility, but protecting the environment is not sufficiently high on its agenda. While it may have published five of the seven thematic strategies, these do not mask the weakness of the proposed review of the sustainable development strategy of the end of 2005. I must say I am concerned about the plans presented to us by the Commission. For example, when one reads in the thematic strategy on waste that there could be a return to national approaches whereby the Member States themselves would set their modes of managing waste, that, to my mind, would be a retrograde step. When the Commission announces that it wants to make fewer laws by refusing to propose laws that would indeed be burdensome for the Member States or for business in the short term, but that are necessary for the future, it is condemning the Union to political losses. It is all the more incomprehensible for the citizens that the Commission persists with certain legislative proposals that have either already been rejected by Parliament, such as the directives on port services, or been subject to fierce objections from the citizens, such as the directive on services in the internal market. I should like to conclude on a positive note. As much bad news for the Union as for our idea of development … (The President cut off the speaker)

Thanks to the commitment of the UK Presidency and of the European Parliament’s rapporteurs, it has been possible to reach an agreement on this regulation relating to the compulsory licensing of patents for pharmaceutical products. This agreement enables a new balance to be found for the European Commission’s proposal which, in the context of the WTO decision, made it still more difficult for countries faced with serious public health problems to gain access to medicines. This compromise with the Council is satisfying because the compulsory licensing system is extended to NGOs, international organisations and non-WTO members. The compromise authorises exports to countries forming part of the same regional bloc. I regret the refusal to promote technology transfer to the countries of the South, as well as the continued ability of the Member States to prescribe additional requirements. This legislation, which will, however, only enter into force two and a half years after the adoption of the WTO decision, proves necessary for a large number of developing countries faced with serious public health problems. I am delighted that this decision coincides with World AIDS Day.

After the vote in the different committees and having listened to the views of both the industry and the NGOs, the European Parliament’s Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Food Safety had established a balance between the need to protect health and the environment and the need for industrial development in the European Union. It has been approved almost unanimously by the Socialists, the Greens, the members of the Union for Europe of the Nations Group and a large number of the liberals on the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Food Safety and, in my opinion, this compromise of the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Food Safety is the position to support. I voted against the compromise proposed by the Socialist Group in the European Parliament, the Group of the European People’s Party (Christian Democrats) and European Democrats and the Group of the Alliance of Liberals and Democrats for Europe on the registration procedure, because it reduces considerably the number of substances to which REACH applies. A majority voted for obligatory substitution in order to assure European citizens that harmful substances will be withdrawn from circulation and replaced by safe products where they exist. Other important points have been adopted and I voted in favour of Mr Sacconi’s report.

Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, Mr Wijkman’s report deserves our full attention. This text must be considered as our road map to enable us to fight more effectively against climate change in the years to come. The paths laid out are realistic, so it is up to us to adhere to them as rigorously as possible by relying on all the partners involved in implementing the report, from the Member States to the people, and by changing our production and consumption methods. If there is, however, one crucial area in which we must have a far greater involvement by providing ourselves with financial resources equal to what is at stake, it is that of research policy, for there can be no new technologies or innovations without research. Our researchers’ grey matter constitutes a resource for the European Union that we must optimise in order to rise to the challenge of sustainable development and climate change, without overlooking, of course, our responsibility towards the poorest countries. Thus, in the future, we will need to have a research budget that is equal to our ambitions.

 Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, we have been wanting and waiting for this text on which we are going to vote for a long time, and we are all very happy to know that it will soon enable our children to be better cared for. Nevertheless, we must be demanding. Tomorrow, we will have the opportunity to improve this proposal for a regulation so that it best serves the interests of children and public health, and we will improve it by adopting those amendments focussing on research into and the placing on the market of medicinal products with the greatest added value, providing a real therapeutic benefit; indeed, how can we achieve the objective of limiting clinical trials on children without limiting the number of medicinal products placed on the market? If the criterion of the medicinal product’s added value were taken into consideration, this would avoid many unnecessary studies in children. We will also be able to improve the text tomorrow by adopting the amendments that propose greater transparency for pharmacovigilance data and their accessibility to the public. The financial issue is also important for the stability of our social security systems and the guarantee of access to healthcare for all. It is increasingly important when it comes to finding the right financial incentive so that the pharmaceutical industries take a greater interest in paediatric medicinal products. It is important for all European citizens, because it is public money that indirectly finances these financial incentives in the form of the extension of market exclusivity. That is why, in view of the results of the impact assessments, in view of the enormous gaps ranging from EUR 1 to 4 million, it seems to me that we should at least be able to suggest to the industry a two-stage system: a fixed three-month incentive and a three-month extension depending on the level of benefit provided by the medicinal product sold. All of us here want the best for our children, as soon as possible, but we must not be hypocritical. Those who are talking about urgency were not willing to support the proposal to reduce the gap between marketing authorisation and placing on the market, which is currently two years. That is why we will have other meetings and we will really see what we can do for the health of European children.

 I abstained from voting on this report for several reasons. To begin with, I cannot vote in favour of this resolution because my criticisms of the Constitution outnumber by far the very few aspects of it which could be regarded as slight progress. In addition to my grave doubts regarding the construction of a social and political Europe, my most serious criticism relates to the fact that the task of a constitution is to allocate powers and to outline citizens’ rights and duties. The policies and ideological choices set out in the Constitutional Treaty have no place in a constitution, and they preclude any possibility of different policies being implemented. Furthermore, only one goal was pursued in the drafting of this report, namely that nothing but the positive and ‘progressive’ aspects of the Constitution be mentioned. This exclusion of all criticism, no matter how minor, stands in stark contrast to the reservations voiced by this House when the previous resolution on the Intergovernmental Conference was adopted. I am not convinced that either this resolution or this Treaty will make it possible to involve our fellow citizens more in European integration, or to respond to their calls for justice, equality and democracy.

 I abstained from voting on the European Commission’s 2004 regular report and recommendations regarding negotiations on Turkey’s accession to the European Union for the following reasons. I believe that the European Union’s inability to formulate, approve and construct a coherent political project is a major obstacle to the welcoming of Turkey into the Community. It appears to me to be questionable, if not irresponsible, to follow a policy of never-ending enlargement at a time when the political dimension of the European Union and its social and tax harmonisation are far from a reality. At present, the European Union is not in a position to make political proposals of genuine integration to a country the size of Turkey. I would note that my position is not based on arguments relating to geographical, historical, religious or cultural aspects. It is not Turkey’s ability to meet a certain number of conditions which has caused me to hold such a view, but the European Union’s inability to provide the necessary framework to create a common future.

 Mr President, I would like to begin by thanking the shadow rapporteurs who have contributed to the adoption of this report in the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs, not least Mrs Pietikäinen and Mrs Raeva, and to congratulate the coordinators from the Group of the European People’s Party (Christian Democrats) and European Democrats and the Group of the Alliance of Liberals and Democrats for Europe, Mr Gauzès and Mr Klinz, who played an important role in terms of ensuring that this report, which will be put to the vote tomorrow in our plenary session, was adopted in the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs. You know that at the conclusion of the G20 meeting, some of the EU Heads of State – and prominent ones at that – claimed victory by announcing, in a stream of communications, that the age of banking secrecy was over. These thunderous statements aside, the European Parliament – and I welcome this – has now set out to do the practical work and has taken an interest not in communication but in the efforts it can make to effectively combat tax evasion, which is estimated to amount to EUR 200 billion each year. These EUR 200 billion should be compared with the amounts for the recovery plans to help the countries of Europe cope with the crisis; they should be compared with the European Union budget; and they should also be compared with the deficit levels of the countries of Europe. Today, Europe’s taxpayers are thus perfectly justified in asking the European banking sector, and therefore the European banks, to make the efforts needed to allow the Member States’ tax authorities to recover part of the tax income they are losing through evasion or fraud. We have done a constructive job, and I believe that we avoided resorting to dictates or mutual recrimination. We have advanced on three fronts, and I wish to commend what was the draft text from the European Commission and the work done around Commissioner Kovács, who was unquestionably going in the right direction. We have tried, as best we could, taking as our yardstick what the European taxpayers are telling us, to improve the Commission’s text in three directions. We decided that, as regards the scope of the directive, the text was a little too timid, both on the legal structures involved and in the definition of savings products. We know that financial engineering has a considerable imagination when it comes to inventing new financial products to allow some people to escape taxation. This is why Parliament and the Commission propose to introduce a committee procedure that adapts the definition of savings products to the current reality of that financial engineering. However, on this issue, many products are currently excluded from the scope, and, in our opinion, they should be included as quickly as possible; this is particularly the case for some types of pension schemes that work via capitalisation, and, more generally, we think that the proposal to include products which guarantee 95% of the investment does not offer sufficient guarantees. That is why we think the threshold of 90% is more reasonable. Amendments will be tabled to this end tomorrow in plenary. We will see if they are adopted. I regret that we have not found a compromise in committee on this point and hope that plenary gives a strong signal by defining savings products as products which guarantee 90% of the capital and not just 95% products, as the Commission is proposing. Broad consensus was, however, reached on how the scope of the directive should be widened, especially in the wording of Annexes I and III. Annex I is, moreover, considerably strengthened by the report, since we are drawing up a very broad list of tax havens that spares no jurisdiction and that, unlike the G20 list, specifically includes Delaware and Nevada. We have defined more broadly than the Commission the legal constructions that these jurisdictions will have to show either do not exist on their territory or are fiscally transparent, and I believe that this reversal of the burden of proof is a more effective way of fighting tax evasion. However, the main weakness of this text – and I will conclude on this – relates to the transition period granted to three Member States: Belgium, Austria and Luxembourg. Although Belgium has announced it is abandoning the system of withholding tax, I wish to see the system for the automatic exchange of information become widespread and, for this to happen, I would like a date to be set for the end of the transition period. This is why, even though we have adopted the principle of a study to assess the respective merits of the systems of withholding tax and exchange of information for 2011, when the directive is revised, we wish to see 2014 set as the end date for this transition period. I wish to say that we have tried to work in a spirit of transparency and towards improved transparency at a time when European taxpayers are required to contribute, especially in order to come to the aid of the European banking sector.

 Madam President, I will be very brief, as I have already spoken at length just now. I would like firstly to thank Mrs Raeva and Mrs Siitonen, and also the Members, for their speeches and contributions to this text, and to say to Mr Kovács that, in my opinion, I have understood what he said. However, I think that a strong signal tomorrow from the European Parliament on the question of the scope, on the question of banking secrecy, and on the question of the list of tax havens will be a valuable help to the Council, especially if, in future, we need to negotiate new agreements with third countries. Now I would like to finish with the criticism – the gentle criticism, I might add – levelled at Mr Kovács and I by Mrs Lulling. She criticised us for ‘mixing the sheep and the goats’, even though she did so very gently. I would like to say to her that I think, tomorrow, this Parliament, whilst it sometimes mixes the sheep and the goats, will be able to distinguish between the general interest and private interests, and I hope that we will thus have contributed to stepping up the fight against tax evasion.

 Mr President, I too should like to thank Mrs Bowles for the quality of her work and for the result that we were able to achieve in the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs on such an important text as this. I should like to remind my fellow Members that the public purse currently loses between EUR 200 and 250 billion due to fiscal fraud in the internal market. These missing billions mean less public investment, fewer schools, fewer public services, more social needs that cannot be met and, of course frequently, in compensation, higher taxes for those honest and humble taxpayers who do not have the time to spend on tax evasion and tax shopping. I am delighted to see that, on the issue of VAT, there is broad consensus within this House on putting an end to fraud and practices which take advantage of the fragility of the transitional system set up in 1993. We are all well aware since the Liechtenstein scandal that the biggest fiscal fraud is committed by those large savers who place considerable sums of money in third countries, often tax havens, to avoid tax. The European Union has an instrument for fighting this fraud: the Directive on the Taxation of Savings Income. However, as underlined by Mrs Bowles, there are too many loopholes in this Directive and it only covers savings income in the form of interest payable to individuals. It is therefore currently far too easy to artificially set up a legal entity, sometimes with a single partner or shareholder, or to invent financial revenue that is not strictly interest in order to avoid tax. It is therefore absolutely vital to widen the scope of this Directive, as proposed by the report, so that, at the very least, fiscal fraud is not so easy. This is in fact a moral imperative. I must express my astonishment and disappointment at the amendment tabled by the PPE-DE Group which, due to both its timidity and its direction, ends up proposing that nothing should change and that, in terms of fiscal fraud, we should stick with the current situation. Let us put these positions to the European people, in particular the German people, and let us see how the European and German people judge the choices made here. I have heard big statements made in the media, particularly in the German media, about this issue of fiscal fraud. Here, in the silence of the European Parliament, other choices are being made. I hope that the European people will be the judge of these.

Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, the euro is an increasingly expensive currency by comparison with those of our main partners and competitors. That is particularly true compared with the dollar. Of course, the policy of systematically increasing European Central Bank reference rates, coupled with the reverse policy of the Fed, is merely accentuating the problem. This exchange trend that is damaging the competitiveness of the European economy has been the subject of much comment, particularly by highly prominent European leaders. The predominant view, in this House in particular, is that the ECB has sole and absolute competence for exchange rate trends. The ECB itself refuses, through its President, to express any views on the subject, apart from a few vague international declarations. Not only is this situation untransparent and undemocratic, it is, above all, contrary to the Treaty. Article 111 of the Treaty reads, and I quote: 'In the absence of an exchange rate system in relation to one or more non-Community currencies as referred to in paragraph 1, the Council, acting by a qualified majority either on a recommendation from the Commission and after consulting the ECB or on a recommendation from the ECB, may formulate general orientations for exchange rate policy in relation to these currencies'. I repeat: 'may formulate general orientations for exchange rate policy'. In other words, the euro zone has indeed equipped itself with the means to decide democratically on its exchange policy. My question is simple and it is addressed to the Heads of State and Government: instead of moaning, what are the governments of the Union waiting for before they act?

 Madam President, Commissioner, the Transatlantic Economic Dialogue comes in a context which is marked by a triple crisis: the global banking and financial crisis, to which we still cannot see an end, the crisis in food prices, and finally, the ongoing crisis in oil prices. All these shocks have appeared against a general background of global warming and climate change, which calls for cycles to be reversed and certain dogmas on which we have based the prosperity of Western society to be challenged. Could strengthening our transatlantic relations serve this objective? I do believe so, though it will be difficult, complex and not without conflict. This resolution sketches out a few responses that chime with the demands and aspirations of European and American public opinion. Firstly, it is not a matter of lowering our sights merely to the creation of a transatlantic free trade area, but of making sure the development of our trade serves other more laudable objectives, which promote social and environmental standards. From this point of view, the resolution we will be voting on tomorrow is well balanced. It recognises that the so-called obstacles to trade between the European Union and the USA are often laws with a specific social, environmental, cultural or public health purpose, and that these obstacles cannot be removed without a democratic decision and positive legislative action to protect these objectives. The text also encourages the European Union to draw inspiration from certain bilateral trade agreements signed by the USA, containing detailed provisions on labour law. It is for these reasons in particular that I believe this resolution is useful for the transatlantic dialogue.

 Mr President, this crisis is the third major crisis in 10 years. Could it have been avoided? Mr McCreevy tells us it could. To do this, we would need to teach the poor not to borrow money when they have none. What is the reality? US sub-prime mortgage lenders are the main culprits and players in this crisis. To increase their profits, they have turned to households in great financial difficulty. In 2006, half of the loans granted were made without a check on income. These lenders have earned money with loans that should never have been made. They have been supported by their banks; however, these are controlled by their board of directors, auditors and regulatory authorities. That has not prevented the banks from lending money to credit agencies, or from selling their customers lucrative though risky financial products on the back of this mortgage lending. These securities, backed by the sub-prime market, were bought on a massive scale by hedge funds mostly domiciled in tax havens, which are exempt from any regulation. So it is the whole control and supervision chain that failed. My question is simple. What serious initiatives is the Commission now going to take to prevent the rush of the financial markets to the American property market from happening with new assets tomorrow, ending up with the same results: a stock market crisis then loss of growth?

Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, I cannot resist the urge to react to the remarks made by Mr Juncker and his evening visitor, by first recommending that he ought not to let himself be taken advantage of by this evening visitor, especially with regard to the nature of the deficits that he is in the process of examining closely in France. That said in passing, these deficits have nothing to do with new investment in research, development and innovation, as the Lisbon Strategy suggests, but are basically due to a EUR 14 billion tax reduction, targeted at the most well-off people in France, a reduction that prompts most economists to wonder about its supposed positive knock-on effect on EU growth. I shall digress no longer. At present, I should like to thank Mr Mitchell for his report and the work he has done in this regard within the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs. This report makes some important progress and advances, not least in terms of transparency in the work and decisions of the European Central Bank and of the democratisation of appointment procedures. This text also calls for more caution regarding a possible rise in interest rates in order not to jeopardise growth; it calls for caution, too, regarding hedge funds, so as to enhance surveillance and regulation in the interests of financial stability and transparency. Finally, we can be pleased with the consensus that the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs has been able to reach on the need to invest huge sums in research, education and training. That being said, I would return to the issue of exchange rates because, contrary to the fatalism and to the prevailing ultra-conservatism, we would like to point out that the instruments with which we can take action do exist. Article 111 of the Treaty merely stipulates that, I quote, ‘in the absence of an exchange-rate system in relation to one or more non-Community currencies (…) the Council, acting by a qualified majority either on a recommendation from the Commission and after consulting the ECB or on a recommendation from the ECB, may formulate general orientations for exchange-rate policy in relation to these currencies'. That is what we are asking you for, Mr Juncker, Mr Trichet and Mr Almunia: general orientations for exchange-rate policy in relation to the currencies of our major partners and competitors, rather than a general laissez-faire policy and not very credible declarations on the lack of economic impact of a largely over-valued euro. Finally, I should like to say a few words about an issue on which there is major disagreement between the two sides of this House: wage policy. Like you, Mr Juncker, we note that the share of wages in the GDP of the Eurozone keeps on falling and that, at the same time, the wages, golden parachutes and other stock options of the directors and managers of large companies are a real provocation for European workers, whose purchasing power is weakening. Like you, Mr Almunia, we are calling for a legal minimum wage in every EU country or at least in the Eurozone. Encouraging the social partners to agree on significant wage increases, as the social partners of Germany’s metallurgical industry have done, means not only aiming for a better distribution of the fruits of growth, but also, in our view, helping to perpetuate growth by giving households more confidence and by increasing consumption.

Madam President, I should like to congratulate the rapporteur, Mr Caspary. I am going to confine myself, in one minute’s speaking time, to mentioning the main facts in the report by the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs, which is responsible for monetary policy issues. The Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs took an interest in the issue of the rates of exchange between the euro and the currencies of our main partners and competitors in order to highlight that the benefits expected from a reduction in customs duties on exports, or the market shares that one might hope for from enhanced controls in the area of non-tariff barriers, may clearly be reduced to nothing by an unfavourable change in the exchange rate. That is why we are suggesting that the Commission propose new trade defence instruments that will enable European producers to defend themselves faced with an excessive depreciation in the currencies of our competitors and that we look at the United States, where a number of our fellow legislators in the US Senate have devised a system that hits imports from countries with artificially undervalued currencies with a corresponding customs duty. So, without going that far, we believe that the inertia shown in this area has become incomprehensible. The other issue among the many contributions in the report by the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs, which I should like to point out quickly, is the issue of the environment. I believe that it is unfair that European producers, who must meet costs associated with less-polluting production methods, should have to compete with cheap imports from countries that refuse to do their bit to help combat global warming. That is why the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs is proposing the creation of a carbon tax.

 Mr President, Commissioner, I too should like to thank the Commission for having opened this debate on the EU’s trade defence instruments, and I should also like to congratulate Mr Guardans Cambó on having offered us the opportunity to debate the subject today. What I find striking about the Commission’s questionnaire, or, more broadly speaking, about all its thinking about trade policy, is the lack of any reference whatsoever to the issue of the euro exchange rate against the currencies of our main trading partners. I want to know from Commissioner Mandelson just how he thinks the European Union’s trading interests can be effectively defended when the euro stands as it does against the dollar, the yuan and the yen? If, then, I may take the example of the aerospace industry, which, with its plans for redundancies and cutbacks and its threats of farming work out and of moving it to other sites, holds the centre of the stage today, a ten-cent change in the euro/dollar exchange rate amounts to the loss or gain of a billion euros in Airbus’ year-end figures. Is it not the case that competitive currency devaluations on the part of our competitors are the most flagrant examples of dumping, the consequence of these being that Airbus, the flagship of European industry, now finds it does better to produce some of its aircraft outside the euro zone if it wants to be able to compete with Boeing? Just what we always wanted! I would encourage Commissioner Mandelson to look to the European Central Bank and do something, today, about making it responsible not only when the euro’s value goes down but also when it goes up, for has the time not come for the Council and the Commission, by virtue of the powers accorded them by Article 111 of the Treaty, to at last discharge their responsibilities and enable us to equip ourselves with something we cannot do without – the general outlines of an exchange rate policy?

I voted against this directive because I feel that, despite the improvements obtained in the parliamentary debate and under the pressure of the trade unions’ and citizens’ involvement, it remains profoundly liberal. No prospect of genuine harmonisation, aimed at benefiting consumers and workers, is envisaged in return for the fearsome deregulation of the services sector in Europe, which is mainly aimed at benefiting businesses. As for public services, while the Commission refuses to make progress on the framework directive on services of general interest, the Services Directive helps to weaken public services, some of which will suffer its effects in the same way as simple commercial services. Finally, the ‘prohibited requirements and requirements to be evaluated’ in Articles 14 and 15 make it impossible or, at least, extremely difficult, to carry out any public regulation in the services sector. There will be a maximum price for basic services; a minimum number of employees in order to guarantee the quality of certain sensitive services; territorial planning, for example for the opening of supermarkets; and so many rules that were considered until now to guarantee respect for the general interest and that are now regarded as so many unacceptable barriers to freedom of establishment and to the freedom to do business.

Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, this report contains several interesting and welcome recommendations for which I would like to thank the rapporteur. Thus, instead of simply calling for public spending cuts, the report recommends freeing up resources to make what are presumably necessary public investments in education, training, infrastructure and research. Furthermore, instead of recommending wage cuts, the European Parliament admits - that is in fact the term that is used - that, in the long term, real wages and productivity should grow simultaneously. I would thank the rapporteur for his efforts at moderation and conciliation. However, the subject of this debate is the economic performance of the euro zone. In fact, I believe that, despite the recent and even unexpected improvement of growth indicators, the economic situation remains fragile and unsatisfactory. After all, the Commission’s macroeconomic policy affects the daily lives of millions of Europeans whose purchasing power, I would point out, is threatened by stagnating salaries and by an increase in the cost of living and whose working conditions continue to decline, while social protection is also dwindling. The practical response offered by the Commission and the European Central Bank is always the same: to fight inflation through budgetary austerity and wage cuts, while increasing competition in the services, capital, products and labour markets. Perhaps the time has come to evaluate the results of this policy and to consider whether dismantling public services, deregulating the labour market and cutting public expenditure really is a sustainable way of driving growth in the euro zone and in the European Union. Unfortunately, no period of reflection is on the agenda. In two days, we shall have to give our opinion on a ‘services’ directive that is admittedly improved, but that remains true to Fritz Bolkestein’s deregulatory model. In a few months’ time, we will have on our agenda a directive proposing the end of the public postal service. As for energy, despite the chronic instability of the oil-producing zones, despite the gas blackmail exercised by a neighbouring country, despite global warming and despite power cuts extending across half of Europe, it is all to no avail and the response remains the same: to complete the liberalised and deregulated internal energy market in Europe. The euro zone’s economic report is perhaps a little better this year, but its social and political performance remains, in my eyes, as bad as ever.

Mr President, it is obvious that the United States and the European Union must strengthen their dialogue and their cooperation in the economic, commercial, regulatory or even the social domain by means of the promotion of decent work as trade unions on both sides of the Atlantic wish. The question, therefore, is not: ‘Should transatlantic relations be improved?’, but ‘How can they be improved?’. From this point of view, I do not think that the answer would necessarily be the creation of a barrier-free transatlantic marketplace by 2015. Are all the barriers to the transatlantic market undesirable? No. Do we want to open up our market to Genetically Modified Organisms (GMOs) or to beef from cattle raised on hormones? No. Therefore, I want the transatlantic agenda to be based on practical research of general European interest, and not on unconditional commitment to the doctrine of free trade as a goal in itself. I doubt also whether this is necessarily the right time to propose a bilateral initiative on such a scale when our American partner is threatening global macroeconomic stability by allowing its trade and budget deficits to slide while it is publicly calling into question the merits and principles of multilateralism, or opposing initiatives like the Kyoto Protocol or the International Criminal Tribunal. I should like Mrs Mann’s excellent report to be amended in light of this.

 Mr President, I thank Commissioner Almunia for the favourable welcome he has given my report, which is also the report of the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs. Allow me to emphasise a fact that is important enough to be worth pointing out: the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs voted unanimously in favour of this report. I would also like to pay tribute to the work of the Committee on Development and the Committee on International Trade, and in particular that of their draftsmen, Mr Wijkman and Mr Bourlanges, who have greatly contributed to improving this report that comes at a time when the International Monetary Fund is reflecting on its strategy and on how to assess the development of its mission, the impact of its policies and the way in which it works. I would like to return to the spirit in which the shadow rapporteurs and the entire committee worked to ensure that our Parliament's report makes a useful contribution to the strategic revision of the International Monetary Fund whilst taking account of the major challenges facing the fund: first the issue of its governance, then the issue of its economic doctrine and of the impact of its choices on the Millennium Goals, and finally, more generally, the way in which, through its role of monitoring and crisis prevention, it now continues to guarantee global macroeconomic and financial stability. On the issue of governance, let me remind you that the Member States are currently divided into nine constituencies, which means that the European Union, if we can talk about the European Union in this context, has no unified representation. It is thus through these nine fragmented constituencies that the European Union expresses its opinion. It can also be seen - and this point is stressed in the report - that there is little or no coordination between the Member States within the International Monetary Fund. That is why this report advocates, firstly, strengthening coordination between the European seats and, secondly, step-by-step progress towards representation for the European Union as a whole within the International Monetary Fund with, of course, the prospect of a single seat, passing in the meantime via a single seat for the Eurozone. As it stands, the report does not exactly refer to the issue of the single seat, but sets the objective of ensuring that the European Union is represented and votes as a single block within the International Monetary Fund, which seems to me to be an absolutely vital step. Why is it vital? Because it would give the European Union the blocking minority that it does not currently have, in other words 15% of the voting rights within the International Monetary Fund. The United States are currently the only ones to have a blocking minority, and we know what impact it can have on the major political and strategic choices that the International Monetary Fund has been able to make. That is a very important key element. I would add that these changes in the European Union's representation may also make it possible to resolve the issue of the distribution of voting rights and thus of the influence of the emerging economies and developing countries within the governing body of the International Monetary Fund. We feel that the representation of the emerging economies should be in better proportion to their economic weight. It is also necessary for the countries with the biggest populations but the smallest economies, in other words the developing countries, to have much greater voting rights than they currently do, for the simple reason that they are the 'beneficiaries' of the International Monetary Fund's policies. That is why the report advocates increasing the number of basic votes: in any event, this is one of the possibilities to explore in the immediate future. The second point we are emphasising relates to the issue of the legitimacy of the International Monetary Fund's interventions, particularly when the scope of those interventions is becoming ever wider. We favour improving the transparency of the International Monetary Fund and the way it works. I am thinking in particular of the recruitment of experts and of the need to diversify their profiles, so that they can more easily adapt their recommendations to the diversity of the situations they encounter. The final point, which is just as tricky, relates to the way in which we can assess the structural adjustment policies and the International Monetary Fund's recommendations over a number of years. Today, the Fund is much criticised for the implementation of some of its recommendations, for its macroeconomic doctrine and for its rather too strict application of the Washington consensus. That is what led us to call on it to demonstrate greater flexibility and to find the best way of ensuring that the local authorities and countries concerned establish poverty-reduction strategies. This seems to us to be a very important step. We have also suggested that some of the Fund's interventions have not been infallible if you look at the results obtained, the social costs of the structural adjustment plans, or the spread, or even reappearance, of crises. We have emphasised these points to encourage the Fund to alter some of its choices as part of its strategic review. I would add, and I would like to stress this point, that we must not end up, in terms of world governance, with a kind of implicit hierarchy of standards that tries to place the Fund's recommendations at the pinnacle under the pretext that they affect not only macroeconomic stability and growth policies, but also labour market policies, the funding of social programmes, education and health. We must not end up with this hierarchy of standards placing the Fund's recommendations above all other international organisations, sometimes to the point of producing out-and-out contradictions between the Fund's recommendations and those of the international agreements of the International Labour Organisation or the World Health Organisation. To conclude, we hope that the European Parliament feels more involved, particularly with the prospect of a single representation for the European Union, in the responsibility of the EU's administrators within the International Monetary Fund. We hope that, just as the Fund maintains regular relations with the US Congress, it will maintain regular relations with the European Parliament and that it will be equally accountable and responsible to the representatives of the European people.

 Mr President, I would like, in turn, to salute and emphasise the excellent quality of Mrs Kauppi’s work. This is a divisive subject, but we have succeeded in setting aside our national interests in order to reach, in my view, a sound and constructive compromise that will enable us to remove the existing barriers to cross-border clearing and settlement transactions. This compromise is based on the idea of not pre-empting the results of the impact assessment currently being conducted by the European Commission. Nevertheless, we felt it was important to remind the Commission of the principles that should guide the consolidation of this sector, which is so essential to a robust and smoothly functioning European banking system and thus to the financing of our economy. First of all, free competition. The system must guarantee undistorted competition between the various operators, whatever their size or activities. I am pleased that the text does not rule out the separation of activities, when that same separation is advocated in all other industrial sectors as a means of avoiding cross-subsidisation and the dumping that ensues. In addition, I hope that the Commission will be able to conduct a proper ex ante
 examination of dominant positions in the market, including in cases where turnover is below the required threshold, but where the impact of such mergers on our economies would certainly justify such an examination. Next, transparency: even though our compromise does not, at this stage, allow me to recommend the separation of the various different post-market activities, it is vital to reaffirm that transparent pricing structures are an essential guarantee for those in this sector who might benefit from fair and undistorted competition. Next, security, since the major challenge here is of course to ensure that the European financial system is secure and can guard against both systematic and operational risks, and also against the criminal activities of certain parties. We therefore refuse, at this stage, to rule out any instrument, directive or free organisation of the market, or any model, with or without separation of activities, that could be used to consolidate post-market activities. Nevertheless, I think it is likely that a legislative text will be necessary in order to remove legal and fiscal barriers, if appropriate to adapt the European rules on competition to these activities and, finally, to provide the transparency and accounting separation necessary to the existence of fair competition. I will conclude by saying that it is time to make progress in this field, because European consolidation is underway, without supervision. Having successfully harmonised the markets, we urgently need to harmonise the post-market sector if we want to benefit from all our work in the context of the financial services action plan.

Mr President, Commissioner, Mr Trichet, I can imagine how satisfied you must be reading Mr Lauk’s report, and I will not criticise you for being so. To begin with, the consensus emerging within this Parliament on the subject of the monetary orthodoxy of the ECB can legitimately fill you with glee. Then, by observing the extent to which Mr Lauk’s report falls into line with your recommendations and stresses the de facto political power of the ECB, you must be overjoyed! You have nothing to fear from the representatives of this Parliament as they are zealous defenders of the solutions that you recommend and that have, however, with tragic consistency, failed to restore growth and confidence in Europe. So rejoice! Mr Lauk’s report puts forward better proposals than the social security system reforms that you commend, better proposals than the pay restraint that you suggest, better proposals than the reduction in public spending that you oversee. It calls for an increase in working time in Europe. This is my first term of office in this Parliament. As a member of the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs, I have intervened on several occasions in this Chamber to express my concern, among the empty benches, about the poor economic and social results of the economic guidelines decided on by the Commission and by your institution. I note in passing that those on whom this report is going to impose the burden of additional working time have been more effective than you in fighting against the overvaluation of the euro by voting no, in France and in the Netherlands, to the policy that you support. I am a fervent supporter of Europe. As such, I am in favour of monetary stability and I defend with conviction a greater convergence of the European economies, but I call on you to acknowledge that there is not just one possible economic and monetary policy and to remember that the effectiveness of your term of office is first and foremost assessed in the everyday lives of Europeans and in what they have to say about their lives.

Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, our resolution echoes the United Nations’ Millennium objectives. The United States and the European Union are jointly committed to implementing this vital programme to reduce world poverty. The US and the European Union co-manage the Bretton Woods institutions. This shared responsibility is based, in particular, on that tradition, that tacit agreement which allocates management responsibility for the International Monetary Fund and the World Bank to Europe and the US respectively. We should not forget that the IMF was created to preserve the stability of the international monetary system. It has a very different role today. All developing countries are effectively dependent on the IMF, on its loans and its benevolence, for the finance needed for their sustainable development. We cannot ignore the outcome of this policy. Apart from the fact that the IMF has partly failed in its role of monitoring global economic stability by failing to anticipate – or indeed by actually provoking – a number of regional and international financial crises, we need to assess with the US the negative impact of the conditions, based on the Washington consensus, which the IMF imposes on countries requesting its assistance. Finally, in the area of global reform of the multilateral system, the agenda for the transatlantic discussions should also include the return of the Bretton Woods institutions into the United Nations system.

 Mr President, since we are speaking of steering the European economy, I cannot resist making the following observation: by bringing the euro closer to the dollar, the combined efforts of the citizens of France and the Netherlands will have done more, in the space of a few days, to make European exports more competitive than anything the European Central Bank has done. I would therefore like to pay tribute to the effectiveness of Europe’s citizens rather than the certainties of the central bankers. The March Council’s decision to reform the Stability and Growth Pact – a decision largely inspired by yourself, Mr Almunia – is a step in the right direction. It is not enough, however, to reassure people that the European Union is capable of adopting a strategy that will bring lasting revival to the economy. We cannot separate the debate on the future of the Stability and Growth Pact and hence on the coordination of economic and budgetary policies from the debate on the financial perspectives. How can you cut the Member States’ deficits unless, in return, the European Union gives itself the budgetary resources to guarantee social cohesion and revive the European economy? Personally, I do not believe that budget austerity in the Member States combined with budget inertia in the Union is the answer to the twin challenges of growth and employment. I would therefore like to say that it is now time, at the stage we have now reached, to speak about increasing and diversifying the Union’s resources, even if that means amending the Treaties to allow the Union to take out the loans and raise the European tax that our current economic and political crisis demands.

Mr President, Mrs in 't Veld, Commissioner, the Commission is continually telling us that it cannot put forward a framework directive on services of general interest because the issue is apparently too broad and is covered by the subsidiarity principle. With this ‘Monti package’ and the proposal for a directive on services, however, the Commission is dealing with the issue of public services. With one small stroke after another, it is painting a sort of Impressionist picture representing its own vision of public services. Unfortunately, Mr Barroso is no Manet or Renoir. According to this picture, any financing of public services is necessarily State aid, and thus by implication contravenes the principle of free and fair competition, an aberration that must be stamped out. The right of this Parliament goes even further, moreover: Mrs in 't Veld's report rejects the Commission's proposal to exempt the social housing and hospital sectors from the notification requirement. Similarly, if Parliament assents to the requirement for a tendering process prior to any award of public service compensation, it will weaken all the small local public services that are directly and indirectly managed by the public authorities. In conclusion, we are observing, following the dismantling of the great national public services, the weakening of local public services. This report is in fact deceptive: it claims to make consumers happier, while eroding their citizen's rights with regard to public services. This weekend, the Portuguese electorate showed their displeasure at this to their former Prime Minister, Mr Barroso.

 Mr President, if you are to build a genuine partnership, there must at least be two parties to it, so can we expect from George Bush’s second term something different to the unilateral policy of his first? The way the South-East Asian post-tsunami crisis has been handled would tend to lead one to answer in the negative. The Bush administration’s initial response was to propose the setting up of a coalition of donor countries around the United States, rather, of course, than place its intervention under the authority of the United Nations. The European view of this initiative is that it is a sign of ‘no change’ from the previous term. Europe must say to America, as one does to a dear friend, ‘you are cutting yourself off; your policies are isolating you.’ Not all the coalitions in the world will be able to do anything about it; they will not be able to paper over public opinion’s profound crisis of confidence in the United States. One French essayist summed up this widespread sentiment in these words: ‘The United States is in the process of becoming a problem for the world. We were more used to seeing them as a solution.’ Let the Americans defend their interests, let them resolutely defend their security; nobody will hold that against them. What causes doubts to arise, though, is the Messianic and ideological motivation that the US administration attaches to its intervention in Iraq. These doubts take root when human rights violations involve all the belligerent parties in Iraq, and doubts become grave concern when whole populations are infected with hatred of the West, as a reaction to an ill-thought-out military intervention which obviously underestimated how resistant the people of Iraq would be to the transition to democracy thought up by the Pentagon. The Americans did not always espouse this doctrine, though; in the past, they chose to focus their foreign policy on the search for consensus and a sort of general interest. They preferred agreement to coercion and acted within a multilateral framework. In so doing, the USA performed its duties as the world’s major power and strengthened its authority. The American intervention in Iraq put an end to that, but it is not too late to change, provided that the Americans themselves take the initiative in so doing. What must come first is the normalisation of their relationship with the United Nations. The UN is the sole authority competent to decide in favour of international military intervention, and we must invite the United States to join Europe in committing itself, on the one hand, to multilateralism and respect for international law and, on the other, to reform of the United Nations, particularly as regards the Security Council and the way it is made up.

 Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, leaving aside the uncertainty caused by movements in the price of oil, the European Central Bank (ECB) has succeeded rather well in its quest for price stability. Is the euro zone economy, for all that, in good health? Obviously not. Results are mediocre, growth is weak, domestic demand is running out of steam and unemployment is severe, whilst inequality and poverty are on the rise. Hamstrung by the ECB’s independence – which is absurd, yet is enshrined and is soon to be set in stone in the constitution – rendered impotent by the absence of economic governance, weakened by a Stability and Growth Pact that is both rigid and stupid, the EU has subordinated itself to the ECB’s decisions and is paying for price stability in Europe with weak growth and high unemployment. The out-going Commission proposed a reform to the Stability and Growth Pact that was based on common sense, and yet the ECB – through the voice of its Chairman – completely devoted to its monetarist dogma, was worried that the reform might go beyond the merely cosmetic, in particular by introducing the golden rule that support would be available for the investment needed to meet the Lisbon objectives or by laying the groundwork for a counter-cyclical budgetary policy capable of restarting the machine during periods of slowdown. I am personally convinced that the dogmatic leadership of the ECB is the natural consequence of a deadly choice for the EU and its citizens, which consists of removing all forms of economic governance from any political control. I would add that the upshot of this choice is that the most damaging strategies are encouraged. This report, despite its author’s opinion, is thus symptomatic of this phenomenon. In demanding structural reforms, it stigmatises social systems and pension schemes. It also calls for an increase in the working hours of European workers. At this stage, therefore, this report fails to convince us, not least because it has been contaminated by the amendments tabled by the Group of the European People’s Party (Christian Democrats) and European Democrats. Accordingly, we shall submit several amendments in the course of this debate, and if those amendments are not adopted we will vote against.

Farming in mountain areas is a crucial factor in both local economic development and environmental protection (e.g. combating climate change, biodiversity, provision of open and secure recreational and tourism areas). The specific disadvantages connected to altitude, topography and climate that face mountain farmers justify compensatory payments to offset the natural disadvantages and direct income support to offset their additional production costs and the growing role of managing their local area. In my view, the key issues are as follows: to avoid full decoupling of agricultural aid in the stockfarming sector, as it risks leading to job losses; to support the dairy sector, for it plays a central part in disadvantaged areas; to increase support for the settlement of young farmers; and to encourage solidarity between upstream and downstream in regard to water management. I am also in favour of establishing a genuine integrated European strategy for mountain areas, to ensure that the specific features of mountain areas are taken into account in the formulation of the various European policies.

 Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, I must first of all thank the rapporteur, Mr Aylward, for the excellent work he has done in consulting the professionals and the sheep and goat sector and for the very comprehensive report that he has submitted to us. The sheep, lamb and goat sector has had a rough ride over the last ten years as a result of a series of crises, including epizootic-type diseases, but more especially because of the decoupling of aid, which has led to a marked decline in the sheep and lamb population as breeders quit the industry. The sector is currently experiencing real difficulties and it is now time for us to sit up and take notice, for this sector is capable of producing high-quality meat and milk and it plays a key role in ensuring the natural upkeep and improvement of the local terrain, which also includes reducing the risk of fire and natural disasters. I support the proposals that have been put forward by our rapporteur and by the Committee on Agriculture and Rural Development relating to financial support for the production and promotion of agricultural products. Faced with foreign imports that already total nearly one quarter of European production, I believe that it is important to develop a European quality mark that can be used in addition to local and national origin labels. I also think that the introduction of an electronic tagging system on the date set by the European institutions will only be possible if the European Union first provides the necessary funding, for the industry itself in its present predicament would not be capable of doing so. Unlike the previous speaker, I believe that setting up an implementation task force would be an appropriate step, but in my opinion this should include representatives from the professional organisations so that developments in the field can be closely monitored. Finally, I would remind you that we need to act as a matter of some urgency, and certainly by next year, if we want to save this sector, for I fear that using Article 69, which has now become Article 68, as a health check for sectors in crisis will simply come too late in the day.

Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, first I want to congratulate Gábor Harangozó on the excellent job he has done and for his thoughts on this complex and delicate subject. I wanted to play an active part in the opinion drafted by the Committee on Agriculture and Rural Development on this report, for the most vulnerable people are often concentrated in the least developed rural areas and in areas with permanent natural disadvantages, which means that agriculture and rural development policy have a major role to play there. Cohesion policy must, in my view, seek to maintain income-generating agricultural and non-agricultural activities in rural areas, in order to maintain a population that is often tempted by rural exodus, but also to welcome new arrivals. It is important to promote family farming, which creates jobs, and equal access to public services as also the provision of public services in order to respond to the needs of disadvantaged families, communities and groups. In short, we must make the rural environment attractive and fit to live in. We can achieve that aim by ensuring a linkage between the various policies conducted in these areas and targeted at these fragile groups and, therefore, drawing more on the complementary nature of the various available financial instruments.

In the light of the difficulty in finding new generations of European farmers, the European Parliament decided to look at the ways to promote the installation of young farmers, which should guide the CAP Health Check. As the shadow rapporteur of the PSE Group, I put forward the following proposals: - it is a priority to respond to the food, energy, environmental and territorial challenges, - the new farmers must benefit from support measures, especially those who do not inherit a farm and those who are based in areas with permanent natural handicaps: higher installation aid, subsidies for agricultural loans and accompanying measures following installation, - these support measures must be compulsory under the second pillar of the CAP and the aspect of access to agricultural property must be examined, - living conditions in rural areas must be improved: equal access to public services, social amenities, etc., - we must develop access to vocational training (replacement during training and access to agricultural research), - we must promote the farming profession and the standards respected by farmers at European level.

I supported the Wojciechowski report on a new animal health strategy. As an elected Member from the Massif central-Centre district, I am especially worried about the current spread of the epizootic disease of ovine catarrhal fever, which is very serious in terms of duration, propagation, the spread of the various serotypes of the disease in areas that had until then been disease-free and the serious socio-economic effects of restricting animal movements and trade. I think the Commission should formulate an animal health action plan to improve its ability to react to such serious animal epizootic diseases by financing research, compensating for losses, giving advances on payments, etc. I voted against Amendment 12, concerning the fact that transporting live animals over long distances is likely to increase the risks and that animals intended for slaughter should not be transported for more than nine hours. Conversely, I voted for Amendment 3, to the effect that the quality of transport is more important to animal well-being than its duration. There is a stringent, specific regulation on this matter and we would be well advised to monitor its implementation.

The world food crisis (83% price rise), which is currently reflected in hunger riots in the developing countries, and the fall in the most modest European consumers’ purchasing power are, in my view, connected with the following: - the unprecedented stock market speculation on basic food prices, which is exploiting the tensions and the highly volatile agricultural markets in an unacceptable fashion; - the growth in the cultivation of crops for energy purposes, at the expense of essential food crops; - the weaknesses of European development policy; - the fact that export crops have been supported in the developing countries at the expense of food crops and food self-sufficiency, and - the current world trade rules that generate conditions that are particularly unfair to small and medium farmers, especially in the developing countries. Over and above emergency measures, when we report on the health of the CAP we must redefine the way we intervene on the world markets (infrastructure, intervention stocks, risk management, prospects and economic modelling of price changes, etc.), reconsider the decoupling of aid and globally rethink our agricultural production models to ensure that they are productive and enduring.

 The Community Tobacco Fund financed by the transfer of a certain amount of tobacco aid for the years 2006 and 2007 promotes initiatives to raise public awareness of the harmful effects of smoking. The Committee on Agriculture and Rural Development has proposed extending the funding until the end of the financial perspective and has increased the percentage rate to 6%. Tobacco consumption in Europe has not changed and the gradual reduction in European production has been replaced by tobacco imports. The parallel question of maintaining the CMO in tobacco and therefore of postponing the 2004 reform that should have applied from 2010 must be addressed during the health check of the CAP because decoupling causes the almost total abandonment of production with no sustainable alternative from the point of view of the economy and jobs, which has had very serious consequences for the rural areas concerned but no impact on public health. I do not think the fight against smoking and the extension of a transitional period enabling European producers to find alternatives to growing tobacco and reduce the negative impact on our regions are mutually exclusive.

 Madam President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, as its title suggests, this question deals with the economic consequences of the GMO authorisation procedure. I would therefore like to ask the Commissioner whether the Commission has requested any studies on the causes of the rise in the price of animal feed and I would like to know, too, what proportion of the feedingstuffs imported in recent years has contained traces of GMOs not authorised in Europe and where these products came from. That would be useful in assessing the scope of these incidents. Unlike Mrs De Lange who has just spoken, I refute the causal link drawn between the principle of zero tolerance of GMOs and the considerable increase in the price of feed. The two should not be lumped together since we know very well that this increase is due to the combination of several factors, which I will not go into here, but primarily to stock market speculation on future agricultural markets. Moreover, this increase affects all countries, including those with very flexible legislation on GMOs. Nevertheless, it is true that European livestock farmers are in great difficulty and the main reason for this is the fact that the EU is highly dependent on feed imports. My main question is thus as follows: why are we so dependent and how should we respond? I want to ask the Commission if it has carried out an analysis of the economic consequences of the Blair House Agreement, for which the European Union gave up its own production of animal feed. In order to reduce this dependency, there are two options, in my opinion. The first is to do everything we can to save – and I mean save – the last European fodder and protein crops and to encourage restructuring, avoiding, for example, the complete decoupling of aid during the CAP Health Check, particularly as these crops offer indisputable environmental qualities for crop rotation and, consequently, for the soil. On the other hand, the Commission must look into diversifying our source of supply. In December 2007 I took part in a conference organised by the GM-Free Network, which demonstrated that supplies of non-GMO feed do exist and that contacts need to be established between producers and importers. I hope that everyone is aware that consumers have a right... (The President cut off the speaker)

 Mr President, Council representative, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, I would like first of all to underline the severity of the food crisis and its dramatic consequences in terms of exacerbating poverty and famine for people in developing countries. The most disadvantaged people in our western countries are also affected by the rise in food prices and have been struggling for months with the daily price increases. An urgent response is needed for this situation, as well as tailored solutions in the longer term, with the common agricultural policy recast as a development aid policy and a WTO-style trade policy preventing abuse of the dominant position by supermarkets in Europe, as well as food speculation, since agriculture is no ordinary economic sector. The risks of famine and social and political destabilisation are too great, and I should remind you that the right to food is a fundamental human right. We cannot leave agriculture to market economics alone, or to speculators who are today in search of safe investments following the property slump and the energy and mineral crisis. We must equip ourselves with the tools of market regulation and solid and coherent agricultural and food policies, and replenish emergency stocks as soon as possible so that we can react to this kind of emergency. In developing countries, we must also prioritise food production and food crops over non-food production, particularly agrofuels.

It was important for the House to issue its opinion on the general guidelines for the future ‘Health Check’. The Socialist Group in the European Parliament has won a number of major victories, such as the criticism of the decoupling of aid (livestock breeding and small crops), CAP objectives in terms of food safety, preservation of ecosystems, land upgrading, the redistributive effect of degressive capping, of modulation, safety nets, recognition of the role of interprofessional associations, agriculture’s contribution to climate change, etc. However, unlike the PSE Group, I was keen to support a number of points: - partial decoupling of direct aid must be maintained for animal premiums, but care must be taken not to include only intensive or large-scale animal husbandry (para. 26, para. 32) - historical references cannot gauge certain farmers’ compliance with high environmental standards (para. 16) - maintenance of progressive capping of direct aid, since this would permit a fairer distribution of CAP resources (para. 67) - criticism of surveys on GMOs, reminder that it is impossible to implement coexistence, support for the precautionary principle (Amendment 30) - rejection of the abolition of milk quotas in 2015 (para. 76)

I wish to congratulate Csaba Tabajdi on his excellent report, and the research and summary he has carried out so successfully. However, I wish to state that I voted against paragraph 27: ‘27. Stresses, in this context, the importance of green gene technology and calls on the Member States and the Commission to put more effort into researching the latest seed and plant protection technologies, to ensure that biogas production does not compete with high-quality food production and to enable the proportion of biomass per area unit to be significantly increased;’ I feel biogases ought to be supplied mainly by agricultural waste. It is not a matter of developing GMO seeds and pesticides in order to promote a much more intensive form of agriculture. This would harm the environment and cancel out all the advantages of biofuels. As the title of the report infers, we must encourage sustainable agriculture above all. I will be responsible for the opinion of the Committee on Agriculture and Rural Development on the draft directive on promotion of renewable energy sources.

 Mr President, Commissioner, President-in-Office of the Council, I would like to thank Mr Goepel for his work, because it is important for the European Parliament to express its opinion on the general guidelines arising from the CAP ‘Health Check’. Personally, I have serious reservations about full decoupling, which carries high risks of the abandonment of production for stockbreeding and even for certain crops. I do not share the optimism of some people who believe that the current situation on world markets guarantees a steady and secure future for European agriculture and that we should continue heading for complete liberalisation. Furthermore, not all agricultural sectors are benefiting equally from price rises, as the particularly serious crisis currently being experienced by European livestock farmers shows. The total abandonment of any market regulation mechanism would seem to me to be hazardous for our food security and that of the world. I think we need to make sure that we maintain intervention stocks so that we can react in the event of food shortages and speculation, maintain common market organisations … (The President cut off the speaker)

 I would like to congratulate Mr Özdemir on his own-initiative report on an EU strategy for Central Asia. In my view, he has clarified perfectly the objectives and priorities for the European Union’s relations with each of the five Central Asian countries. He has correctly pointed out the need for a more coherent regional approach to this strategic region, while highlighting the differences between the countries. I approve of the opinion of the Committee on Development, particularly on the need to eradicate poverty, improve public health and primary school education, and eliminate all forms of discrimination against women and minorities. It is also important that this report underlines the need for progress on democracy, respect for human rights, fundamental freedoms and the rule of law in the region, and this point is key, as far as I am concerned. The report considers that cooperation on energy is of prime importance in Europe’s strategy. Despite this, the European institutions need to be vigilant and ensure that neither human rights in the region, nor the environment, are sacrificed to energy needs and trade agreements.

Madam President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, I first wish to thank and congratulate Mr Mulder for his work, and also for his methodology and the various consultations he carried out. His report on implementation of cross-compliance for agricultural aid has acknowledged a start-up phase in the application of this rather complicated system. The aim is to increase acceptance by all the main players. It recommends a distinction be made between matters arising from Community frameworks and those subject to national implementation. It stresses the importance of the principle of subsidiarity, the regulations and demands adapted to risks and local requirements, but also the importance of a common framework guaranteeing European farmers equal treatment. This dual level of rules has made it extremely difficult to implement the system. Insufficient information has been provided for farmers; risk criteria have been used very infrequently; the management, control and reduction system is too complicated; insufficient consideration has been given to cases of minor non-compliance; control rates are not harmonised; prior notification of controls poses a problem. Personally, I do not wish to question the spirit of cross-compliance, which provides a response to the legitimate expectations of our society: respect for the environment, traceability, food safety and transparency. On the other hand, I do wish to highlight the heavy burden of regulations, the difficulties involved in applying them on the ground and the negative perception some farmers have of them, in the belief that their professionalism and know-how are being questioned. I therefore wish to point out the need for simplification. I was disappointed with the Commission proposals, which were very limited, and I hope that Parliament’s proposals will be taken over and that the Commission will come up with more ambitious suggestions during the Health Check. I wish to emphasise that I do not agree at all with the compensation logic that since European farmers are subject to strict production conditions (animal welfare, environmental concerns, veterinary practices) they should receive agricultural aid. Aid for agriculture would to a certain extent establish a fair playing field as regards competition with farmers in third countries who are not subject to the same production conditions. However, I feel that it is because farmers receive public aid that they should, in return, respect a number of production rules. There should be a genuine contract between farmers and the EU. We must somehow move from constraint to contract. I am therefore pleased that my amendment on this matter was adopted and that, when the farmer makes his single application and declares the area used for agricultural purposes, he must also agree to comply with criteria relating to public health, animal welfare and respect for the environment. The reductions in payments must differ depending on whether non-compliance is deemed an intentional act or the result of negligence. I was also keen for the sanction to be proportionate to the importance of the sphere of activity affected by the non-compliance at the farm, particularly where this is a mixed crop and stock farming holding. Farmers in the different Member States must also be obliged to observe the same rules, and therefore it is important to ensure harmonious transposition of the management requirements set out in the Directives. I also welcome the adaptation measures for the new Member States. On the other hand, even though I support the introduction of a threshold above which the Member States may decide not to apply any reduction of direct aid, the de minimis
 threshold, I am totally opposed to raising this threshold to EUR 250, as proposed in Amendment 16. If this were the case, most infringements leading to a reduction in aid would not be sanctioned and the cross-compliance system for aid would make no sense. I therefore ask you to support Mr Mulder’s Amendment 31 proposing a threshold of EUR 100, a compromise I feel could be acceptable to all.

 As draftsman of the opinion on water quality, I saw that pesticides were implicated in the degradation of the environment, and particularly of surface and coastal waters, because they persist over time, can be transported over long distances, and constitute a diffuse form of pollution, which is difficult to locate resulting from runoffs, direct losses in the soil and the air, the washing of plants by the rain and so on. More generally, the current use of pesticides in our agriculture can have damaging consequences for our health. The Commission’s legislative proposals on the use of pesticides, and procedures for authorisation and placing on the market were therefore very keenly awaited. However, I find the targets inadequate and that is why, in Parliament’s plenary, I unsuccessfully supported the position adopted by the Committee on the Environment asking for an EU target of a 25% reduction in the frequency of application of pesticides within 5 years and a 50% reduction within 10 years, and buffer zones of 10 metres between fields and water courses. I am particularly sorry that this is a first reading and that the text is likely to be watered down even more.

 Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, during World Food Day on Tuesday 16 October, the FAO wanted to raise public awareness of malnutrition, which currently affects 854 million people throughout the world. On this occasion, the rising price of agricultural raw materials was highlighted, particularly its impact on consumers in the developing countries – my fellow Members have spoken about this at length – but also on the populations of poor countries, which import cereals. While in the developed countries, we spend 10 to 20% of our household budget on food, in the least developed countries, this figure is 60 to 80% of the budget, and a 20% increase in the price of cereals is drastic. This situation is made worse by the fact that some countries depend heavily on imports, and are affected by currency fluctuations, climate variations and increases in transport costs. Commissioner, you have responded partially, but I hope there will be other measures. What measures do you intend to take in the short and medium term, for the CAP health check, to put right this difficult situation for consumers in the North, and this even more difficult situation for those in the South, and to contribute to a global food equilibrium?

 Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, concerning the first objective of this Regulation, which is to comply with the obligation to publish information on the beneficiaries of Community funds, I think it is quite right that we should finally know who receives what from the CAP. This is a long-awaited measure, though it is not a question of stigmatising farmers but of creating transparency in finance, which concerns us all as taxpayers and consumers, and over which we have a right of information. I even think that this publication could be utterly beneficial and improve citizens’ opinion of farmers and the payments they receive for services to the community in terms of supplying quality food that meets high production standards and in terms of maintaining the land and the countryside, for example. The publication of an explanatory statement for the payments made and the farm income, as the Committee on Agriculture and Rural Development is requesting, will also be very useful. I fully agree with the practical procedures for publication, defined in the report by our fellow Member, Mr Chatzimarkakis, which consist in setting up a European Internet platform linked to the Member States’ Internet platforms on which the names of regional aid beneficiaries and where they live are put online. In the case of public limited companies or private limited companies, the names of the investors and members of the management board must also be known. I also support the evaluation reports requested of the European Commission in the years following the implementation of this regulation, which will be very useful, the assessment of the benefit of the centralised publication of information by the Commission, and the evaluation of the distribution of the funds, possibly accompanied by legislative proposals to achieve a more objective distribution of funds in the first and second pillars. On the other hand, as regards the methods for accessing these data, I do not agree at all with the proposals for confidentiality or a barrier to entry which, in my view, would completely diminish the transparency effect of this regulation. If transparency is being introduced, particularly regarding public funds, I feel that everyone should be able to access the information, without restrictions. In practice, because the data are first published by each Member State then taken up at EU level, it also seems almost impossible to introduce a registration system, and in any case thirteen Member States have already made these data public without any restriction. I therefore ask you to reject, wholly or in part, amendments 4, 20, 21 and 23, which require registration of the identity and motivations of the users of the public data. As regards the second objective – the tool to reduce or suspend agricultural payments when certain key elements of a national system of control fail or are ineffective – I think this is a useful means of taking action for the European Commission. But obviously it must be used in proportion to the nature, duration and seriousness of the offences. In the same way, the reduction percentage is cut if the Member State has gone some way towards remedying the shortcomings and increased if it has not applied the recommendations previously made. I also hope that the requirement will be retained for Member States to inform the Commission on the way they have decided or plan to reuse the cancelled funds following irregularities.

 We should support the EU’s commitment to achieving the ambitious goal of generating 20% of total energy consumed in Europe from renewable sources by 2020. Renewable energy offers numerous advantages for Europe: lower CO2 
emissions, reduced European dependency and a contribution to job creation and growth. However, we need to monitor the development of all renewable energy from the point of view of sustainability, depending of course on the capacities of the Member States, as well as saving energy through lower consumption and increased energy efficiency. I regret that the Directive on electricity from renewable energy sources does not make cogeneration compulsory and will lead to the building of large-scale biomass power stations without cogeneration, which are not energy efficient and destabilise the market in timber for both industrial and energy generation purposes. There are examples of this in my own region, Limousin. I am pleased therefore that the European Parliament is asking for a proposal on the heating and cooling sectors to be central to the future Framework Directive on renewable energies and I therefore voted in favour of the Thomsen Report.

 Madam President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, I would first of all like to express my support for the recultivation, on a voluntary basis, of land that is currently set aside in order to boost European production of cereals and oilseeds, to replenish stocks and thus ensure our self-sufficiency. However, two production and marketing years seem necessary to allow farmers to adapt to this change. It is also important that we apply quotas to cereal exports so that Europe’s needs are met first. Conversely, I am more cautious about the proposal for a measure abolishing taxes on animal feed. I am well aware that the increase in food prices makes things very difficult for farmers, but I would not want this measure to open the floodgates to imports of genetically modified soya and maize. However, I am in favour of promoting and encouraging the development of a European GMO-free animal feed industry, which would be in a better position to guarantee both our food security and our independence. I would also like to point out that, although set-aside is no longer economically justified, it is vital for biodiversity and for soil and river protection, and this should be recognised and maintained. The Socialist Group is therefore asking the Commission to carry out an environmental impact assessment of the effects of scrapping the set-aside scheme. I am mainly thinking of the consequences that the abolition of set-aside would have on the necessary diversity of sources of pollen and nectar for bees, at a time when this sector is going through a serious crisis. Finally, abolishing set-aside now will not help us resolve all of the problems at the heart of the CAP review in 2008 and 2009.

Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, I should first like to congratulate Mrs Jeggle on her excellent work. I particularly support her objections to the abolition of private storage aid for cream and skimmed milk powder and the wish to introduce a single rate of aid for milk distributed in schools. However, along with some of my colleagues, I should like in particular to mention the current milk shortage, which is undoubtedly due not just to an increase in worldwide demand but also to a reduction in supply which could have been anticipated because it was, in my view, foreseeable. Due to the reform of the CAP and the fall in the price paid to milk producers, some farmers, such as those in France, have got rid of some of their dairy cows and are focusing more on beef and veal or, in Germany for instance, have given up rearing cattle altogether and are growing cereals instead. As a result, France has 100 000 fewer dairy cows than it needs to fill its quota and the European Union needs one billion litres of milk to meet European demand. That shortage is already having and will continue to have serious effects on the prices of milk and hence milk products, as well as on the prices of various other food products. In addition to those increases, the price of other basic foodstuffs such as cereals and meat will rise as a result of the rising prices of animal feed. Obviously that is going to cause extra difficulties for consumers. It therefore seems to me necessary to introduce price stabilisation instruments. In particular, there is a need to build up further stocks as soon as possible to make the market more secure; increase the milk price paid to producers to encourage them to continue and increase production and help them cope with the rise in animal feed prices; provide more support for marketing and distribution channels; increase European milk production quotas as quickly as possible; and evaluate the CMO for milk in the 2008 review of the CAP, in the light of the current shortage and before any consideration is given to abolishing milk quotas in 2015. Finally, I should like to draw attention to the even more difficult situation of milk producers in mountain areas, the producers I represent. Their production costs are higher and supplies are more difficult. What is more, in some countries such as France they are faced with a reduction in the collection aid that offset part of the extra cost of collection in mountain areas. Milk production is one of the sectors that make the biggest contribution to land conservation and land use planning, especially in problem areas. I hope, therefore, that proper consideration will be given to the specific problems of the mountain areas in any future debates on the CAP review and the new CAP.

I voted against the draft Postal Directive because the amendments tabled by Parliament, on the proposal of the Commission, in favour of the total liberalisation of the postal sector on 1 January 2009, and in particular the two-year postponement, are unsatisfactory to me. Paradoxically, this new stage of liberalisation is going to result in additional public spending because, at the same time, the Commission is forcing the Member States to choose a method of funding universal service obligations. The fact is, the three proposed funding options have already been tested out in some Member States and have caused major disputes. Furthermore, the idea of maintaining the reserved area (or residual monopoly for mail weighing less than 50 grams) has not been taken up even though the reserved area is one of the most effective and transparent funding options. Maintaining the reserved area is a political choice that I support but that the Commission and, today, most MEPs, reject. I do not believe that the Commission’s objectives to improve service – quality, price and choice – and to release the sector's growth potential can be achieved in this way. On the contrary, I fear the worst when it comes to the future of the rural areas, mountain regions and islands.

I voted against the Vidal-Quadras report on the prospects for the internal gas and electricity market which prepares for the presentation next September by the Commission of a third ‘liberalisation’ package. First of all I am opposed to the liberal dogmatic principle of ownership unbundling (ownership and management of the network), because it brings no guarantee in relation to investments, supply, safety or access for third parties and renewable energy to the network. It does not ensure availability of energy at the best price for citizens and it does not fulfil public service obligations either. Why then disrupt the present organisation, which works well and ensures the effective independence of system operators, thanks, in particular to strong intervention by the regulator and putting in place strict rules to guarantee equality of treatment and a quality service to all users of the networks, even those who live in regions with a natural handicap and very remote regions. Furthermore, I think that the problem of the independence of the transmission system operators does not relate to the issue of the system of ownership, but to that of regulation. Why, therefore, ask for the elimination of the public character of energy operators?

I regret that the Hökmark report did not take up the many suggestions from the Committee on Regional Development, for which I was the rapporteur. Consequently, it sidelines the European Commission’s initial concern, namely that ‘despite the general increase in broadband connectivity, access in more remote and rural regions is limited because of high costs due to low density of population and remoteness’, and hence the search for solutions. We must recognise that in certain areas of the European Union – isolated and rural areas and new Member States – there is a market failure that justifies intervention by public authorities and particularly by local and regional authorities thanks to the Structural Funds. I had experience of this in the Limousin with the DORSAL project. I am, therefore, pleased by the adoption of the two Socialist amendments that bring matters down to earth because it is in fact in these remote areas that information and communication technologies are most necessary and useful as they make it possible to overcome distances by facilitating relations between users and services – clients and providers – and between the public and public institutions, and to reduce the costs and timescales for the provision of services.

I should like first of all to congratulate Mrs Laperrouze on the excellent work that she has done in relation to this complex and highly technical matter.

To put it briefly, our committee’s aims were: firstly, to point out the precautionary, preventive action and ‘polluter pays’ principles; secondly, to highlight the need for the rational use of land as part of an ecological form of agriculture; thirdly, to establish national and Community complementary measures for implementation, such as the definition of other pollutants and specific monitoring programmes for sediments and biota; fourthly, to highlight the need for a formal evaluation of the consistency and effectiveness of the various Community acts on water quality; fifthly, to call for the coordination of monitoring programmes and national inventories when a watercourse runs through several Member States; and sixthly – finally – to demonstrate the need for the Member States to accompany their inventories with a timetable for implementing the objectives for reducing, and indeed phasing out, emissions.

Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, I should like to begin by speaking about Mr Andria’s own-initiative report on housing and regional policy. I should like first of all to congratulate him on his excellent work and to congratulate the Housing Intergroup on its assessment of the contribution of the Structural Funds to housing policy within the Member States. For my part, as an elected representative of a rural, mountain-based constituency that people are in the process of abandoning, I am more interested in the problem of housing in rural areas. That is why I tabled two amendments on the subject, which have been adopted in part; hence my satisfaction today, because I feared that housing was regarded only as an urban problem. For me, it was a question of highlighting the combination of handicaps in rural areas – low personal incomes, scattered and often dilapidated housing, insufficient local authority or private rental accommodation – and the challenges in terms of revitalising rural territories through the arrival of new populations. Next, it was important to highlight the crucial nature of measures encouraging the acquisition, restoration and renovation of old buildings, to support public and private bodies offering huge amounts of advice and personalised support to help individuals or professionals to settle, and to improve the supply of new or renovated social, public and private housing. The own-initiative report is timely in highlighting the specific nature of the housing problem in small towns that link together to form regional networks and that play a major role in the development of rural areas. In relation to the Janowski report, I am speaking on behalf of my colleague, Mrs Douay, who cannot be here this morning. She would like to point out that she is fully satisfied with the report adopted within the Committee on Regional Development on the contribution of the forthcoming policy to the European Union’s capacity for innovation. She particularly welcomes the adoption of the amendments on SMEs and their role in the innovation taking place at regional level, as well as the amendments on the characteristics specific to mountain regions and rural areas. However, she feels that it is harmful to go back over the wording of paragraph 14, which is the result of a compromise that was fairly widely accepted by the various political groups and that should not be amended.

I was anxious to endorse the following amendments. Amendments 25, 20 and 28, because adequate funding of regional policy is necessary in order to reduce the economic, social and territorial disparities between regions and to carry out future enlargements properly. Amendments 22 and 39, because I feel that it is unacceptable to talk about ‘a special form of EU membership’ and ‘a graduated approach’ to regional policy exclusively for this country and also not to envisage, from this moment on, any outcome to the negotiations under way with Turkey other than membership. Amendments 14 and 24, because the rapporteur’s proposal for an increase in national cofinancing in regions that have received structural funds over several programming periods would put an end to efforts to implement this policy in the most underdeveloped regions of the old Member States. I am opposed to the overly penny-pinching approach of the rapporteur, who is proposing a maximum period of time during which regions may receive structural funding. As I see it, it is precisely these regions that are suffering from natural or human handicaps or from a difficult process of economic regeneration and that are not really equipped to deal with international competition that we must continue to help through the structural funds.

Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, I should like to begin by congratulating Mrs Aubert on the excellent work she has done since the start of the mandate, firstly on the European action plan for organic food and farming and then on this proposal for a regulation. The task was not easy because the proposal undermined the strong and credible identity of organic farming. We can be satisfied with the progress made within the Committee on Agriculture and Rural Development on several points: a stricter definition of the use of phytopharmaceutical products, veterinary treatments and national derogations; increased monitoring at the certification stage, including monitoring of imported products; and an extension of the scope of the regulation and the consolidation of regulatory committees. I also support the dual legal basis, which will move us on to codecision. However, I remain very worried about the issue of GMOs being present, even adventitiously, in organic products. Indeed, the regulation states that a product cannot be labelled ‘organic farming product’ if it contains GMOs, but it does nonetheless accept an adventitious contamination threshold of 0.9% of GMOs, which is inadmissible. That is why I would ask you to endorse Amendments 170 and 171, tabled by the Socialist Group in the European Parliament, which request that the presence of GMOs in organic products be limited exclusively and that the term not be used.

Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, I wanted first of all to thank you all for your contributions, and also to congratulate the officials of Parliament’s Committee on Agriculture and Rural Development and of the European Commission who gave me the necessary technical support. This is a sensitive matter on which the Member States and the European Commission have been seeking an agreement since the beginning of the nineties, as the Commissioner has just reminded us. The crux of the problem is that usually, when meat from calves is sold, no reference is made either to the type of feed the animals are given or to their age at the time of slaughter, although production practices differ greatly from one Member State to another. Consequently, because of differing interpretations, traders and consumers find themselves faced with very different products, but sold under one and the same description: veal. As the European Commission has emphasised, this practice could disturb trade and encourage unfair competition. Studies show that the term ‘veal’ is a sales description that adds value and some traders make use of it to benefit from substantially higher market prices, when in fact they are marketing meat from young bovine animals with very different organoleptic qualities. It is at the request of several Member States and of the European beef sector, who want clarification, that the Commission has set out its initial proposal, which I think is entirely appropriate. The Commission proposal is to lay down precise sales descriptions according to age at the time of slaughter, a criterion that is significant enough and easier to monitor than the feeding regime. It proposes the introduction of two categories and the use of a letter to identify them: ‘X’ for animals slaughtered up to the age of eight months and ‘Y’ for animals slaughtered between the ages of nine and twelve months, letters that Parliament’s Committee on Agriculture and Rural Development has chosen to replace with ‘V’ and ‘Z’ in order to avoid confusions linked with gender. For the first category, the sales description will continue to use the term ‘veal’. For the second, a different term will be used:‘jeune bovin
’ in French, ‘vitellone
’ in Italian, etc. On this subject I refer you to Annex II(B) of the regulation. There is an exception for trade carried out on the domestic market in four countries, Denmark, Greece, Spain and the Netherlands, where, in order to take account of local customs and cultural traditions, it will still be possible to use the term ‘veal’ in the second category. The terms ‘veal’, ‘veal meat’, or any other sales description defined in the proposal may no longer be used in the labelling of meat obtained from animals aged more than 12 months. Traders who wish to supplement the sales descriptions laid down in this proposal with other, optional information, such as the feed used, will, of course, be able to do so. Therefore, coming from Limousin, I could speak to you about ‘white veal’. I was keen to propose changes to the European Commission’s initial proposal to make this legislation more coherent and restrictive and I thank my colleagues for having supported me. In particular I asked for a system of penalties to be introduced in the event of failure to respect the rules, and I proposed amendments to include within the scope of the regulation meat-based products intended for human consumption, prepared, processed or cooked products. I also insisted that the sales description should be used at each stage of production and marketing. I think, however, that certain points are not acceptable and could spoil the balance of the proposal for a regulation. I am talking about Amendments 8 and 12, which were adopted in the Committee on Agriculture and Rural Development. Amendment 8 suggests that designations and IGPs (protected geographical indications) registered after the publication of this regulation could be exempted from it, and this is not consistent with the legislation as a whole. Designations of origin and protected geographical indications that have already been registered are not affected, but it is important that new AOCs and IGPs should be subject to the provisions of this regulation, otherwise they could be completely bypassed. Amendment 12 calls into question the proposal for a regulation based on the criterion of age. In fact, as Annex II shows, the United Kingdom has chosen to give the description ‘veal’ to the first category, and the description ‘beef’ to the second category. This country’s specific requirements have, therefore, been taken into account. Furthermore, I do not support the two new Amendments 26 and 27 presented to plenary. These two amendments introduce a new derogation that, in my opinion, is incompatible with Article 3 of the Regulation, as they allow a given Member State not to apply the regulation if its production of animals in the first category, aged less than 8 months, does not exceed 3% of the total production of animals aged less than 12 months. Ladies and gentlemen, I ask you to support me and to reject these four amendments which would reduce the scope of the Regulation, which is supposed to apply to the whole of the European Union and the scope of harmonisation of the first category ‘up to eight months’, which has been very difficult to attain.

 I must congratulate Mrs Batzeli on her work in this field, of which the economic, social, environmental, territorial and cultural ramifications are enormous. I feel that her own-initiative report is a well-balanced and ambitious one, which will enable Parliament to influence the major guidelines of the reform of the common organisation of the market in wine drawn up by the Commission. The European winemaking sector is in a difficult situation, facing fierce competition from wine from the New World. It should be highlighted, however, that the EU remains the biggest producer, the biggest consumer and the biggest exporter of wine in the world. I strongly object to the Commission’s first proposals, which would place production in the hands of a few major winemaking operations and would lead to a standardisation of wine and to crises in numerous European regions. Permanent grubbing up would lead to the abandonment of production in the areas most cut off and in most difficulty, where there is no alternative form of production, and would serve to speed up the process of desertification. We must respect the European winemaking tradition, the quality and authenticity of European wines and their ties with the soil. It is not by adopting the corrective oenological practices used in other continents that we will become more competitive, but by favouring commercial investment and improving the promotion of our products.

 I should like to congratulate the rapporteur and Parliament’s Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Food Safety on the excellent work that they have done. We do indeed need to take action, as waste management policies do not always advance the cause of recycling and composting. Unfortunately, dumping and incineration are still the most widespread ways of dealing with waste. I am in favour of the five-level hierarchy applicable to waste management (prevention, re-use, recycling, recovery and dumping) as, in my view, the objective of reducing waste must be given priority, and precedence must therefore be given to a policy of waste prevention. I am in favour, for example, of introducing product labelling designed to develop eco-consumption. I am pleased that, for purposes of simplification, excavated land has been excluded from the list of forms of waste. However, I think it necessary to make a clear distinction between recycling and recovery, and to manage incineration practices, with a view to creating genuine energy recovery, which must not constitute a risk to human health and the environment. I support the proposal whereby, in accordance with the ‘polluter pays’ principle, those who produce waste would, as a matter of general practice, be held responsible for it.

 Madam President, last November we rejected the proposal for a regulation on voluntary modulation by a very large majority. As the European Commission has not amended its text, the stage is still set for that text to be rejected again; everyone knows the reasons, so I shall not repeat them: the cuts made to the second pillar, the omission of cofinancing, the fact that cofinancing introduces distortions of competition between States and the imbalance that creates in the structure of the common agricultural policy which, I might point out, is the only common European policy and is at risk of being renationalised as a result. Rural development policy’s need for funding is nevertheless real and I really do fear a growing depopulation of our rural areas if nothing is done to modernise farming structures, to renew generations of farmers, to improve the quality of life and the environment and to encourage economic diversity in the countryside. That is why, Commissioner, I am asking you, instead of voluntary modulation, to propose an increase in the rate of compulsory modulation, making it identical in all Member States. I would also like to stress that, at present, compulsory modulation applies where a farm receives more than EUR 5 000 in aid a year, which means the vast majority of farms. A proper tool for redistributing agricultural aids would also take account of other criteria, such as the size of the farm, its dependence on aid, the labour employed, the gross margin, etc. As well as that, there could also be a ceiling on direct aid to make for better distribution. Unfortunately, even if the European Parliament rejects this proposal overwhelmingly for a second time, a proposal which would normally be an important legislative act, it is only an opinion, and I agree fully with Mr Goepel. I therefore believe we should keep up the pressure on the Commission and the Council while for the time being retaining the 20% budget reserve for the rural development funds for 2007.

I feel that Mr Langen’s report on a strategy for biomass and biofuels successfully describes all of the advantages and disadvantages of using renewable energy sources. However, I should like to point out a few amendments tabled within the Committee on Agriculture and Rural Development that have not been accepted. Firstly, while renewables can help reduce the European Union’s energy dependence, we must also take a broader look at our energy consumption and, thus, at our lifestyles and production methods so that we consume better but, above all, so that we consume less. Next, we should not launch into an intensive and high productivity-focused process for manufacturing renewable energy sources, as this would have harmful environmental, economic and social consequences and would not fall within the European sustainable development strategy. The main function of agriculture must remain food production. Forest resources must be exploited in moderation. Cogeneration must be the rule where biomass production is concerned. Finally, we must organise and improve the channels for supplying, distributing and marketing agricultural and forestry raw materials and energy produced at local market level by preventing excessive journey times.

 I would like to congratulate Mrs Morgan for the initiative she has taken in drawing up a report on the Green Paper presented by the Commission on a European strategy for sustainable, competitive and secure energy. Indeed, today we have to respond to some big questions about the future of Europe: how can we can guarantee a secure energy supply at prices that are predictable and affordable, particularly for the poorest citizens? How can we reduce our dependence on fossil fuels and on a few producer countries at a global level? However, I have had to abstain from the final vote because I think that the proposed complete separation of the ownership of energy networks will not allow us to respond to these questions in a decent way, particularly questions about the security of investments and supply. As Vice-President of the EU-Central Asia Delegation, I am concerned about the call to increase energy supplies from Central Asian producers such as Kazakhstan, Turkmenistan and Uzbekistan. These countries are in fact zones where there is little respect for democracy or for the rule of law, and I think, like President Borrell, that one does not exchange petrol, gas or electricity for human rights.

 Mr President, I want to express my disapproval at what Mr Kyprianou, European Commissioner responsible for health and consumer protection, said at a press conference on 9 November. The Commissioner warmly congratulated four food-sector multinationals – which I will not name – on what they are doing to help fight obesity; he also allowed them to promote themselves by setting up stands at the entrance to the room where the press conference was held. We must bear in mind that one child in five in Europe is obese and that this number is growing every year because of poor eating habits encouraged by the fast food, fizzy drinks and chocolate bars marketed mainly by those four multinationals. Binding legislation to provide European consumers with nutritional information would do them more good than eulogies addressed to companies that have contributed to the obesity explosion for decades. There are other ways of fighting obesity: eating more fruit and vegetables and taking part in sporting activities, which ought to be better promoted. I can therefore only advise Mr Kyprianou to get together with his fellow Commissioner Mrs Fischer-Boel to assist in reforming the common organisation of the market in fruit and vegetables in the interests of a healthy and balanced diet.

Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, everyone is familiar with the 2003 CAP reform, which provided for the freezing of the first pillar and the strengthening of the second, namely rural development. The fact is that the agreement on the new financial perspective – which, I might add, I voted against – runs counter to these two commitments. Indeed, the rural development package has lost EUR 20 billion in comparison with the Commission proposal, a figure that represents, for the 15 old Member States, 35% less than the current period. The proposal for voluntary additional modulation, which is aimed at transferring a maximum of 20% of the sums from the first to the second pillar and which does not meet any of the criteria applicable to rural development policy, is unacceptable. I recognise that the European Commission has attempted, in its proposal for a regulation, to manage this tool, but I share the rapporteur's concerns and I endorse his proposal that it be rejected: the risk of distorted competition is too great if certain Member States choose to deduct 20% from direct aid and not from other types of aid. It is unacceptable for this voluntary modulation not to have to comply with the same rules as those that normally apply to rural development, and the risk of the CAP being renationalised is too great. The funding requirements for rural development policy are, however, real, and I fear more people abandoning our rural areas. That is why I am calling on the Commission to propose, instead of voluntary modulation, an identical increase in the rate of compulsory modulation in all of the Member States. I should also like to stress that compulsory modulation currently applies as soon as a farm receives more than EUR 5 000 in agricultural support per year. The large majority of farms are, indeed, affected. If we are to have a genuine tool for redistributing aid, we should also take account of other criteria, such as the size of the farm, its dependence on aid, the workforce employed, the standard gross margin, and so on. Furthermore, if we are to guarantee that agricultural support is divided up fairly, we should think about capping direct aid.

 I voted in favour of the assent for the strategic guidelines on cohesion, but I should like to emphasise that the regional policy reform took place not only in the difficult context of the renewal of the financial perspective, but also in the context of the revival of the Lisbon Strategy, which clearly reoriented its objectives. The fact is that reorienting them exclusively towards innovation, the knowledge-based economy and competitiveness in the old Member States is not enough to guarantee the objectives of territorial cohesion and sustainable development, which seem to me to take priority. I deplore in particular the fact that the earmarking of appropriations in relation to the Lisbon objectives, together with the classification of expenditure, should not have been made subject to the agreement of Parliament. I also find it regrettable that the territorial dimension of cohesion was not explicitly taken into account as a strategic guideline in its own right. Nevertheless, this is not enough for the development of isolated rural areas. I am worried about the fate that awaits them in the programme, because there is still no clear dividing line between intervention from the ERDF and that from the EAFRD, which is part of the CAP and has very limited funds.

 I voted against Mr Rapkay's report on the Commission White Paper on services of general interest because several amendments that were very important to me were rejected, in particular the amendment calling for a framework directive on services of general interest and those calling for clarification of the criteria distinguishing between services of general interest (SGIs) and services of general economic interest (SGEIs) and the criteria for granting compensation for the provision of public services and in-house provision. We must not give way on these vital issues for the future of public services in our countries, and we must not take a backward step in comparison to what Parliament adopted in the Herzog resolution in 2004 and the Langen resolution in 2001, especially at a time when the Socialist Group in the European Parliament has drafted a proposal for a framework directive on general interest services that goes still further.

One year on from the start of accession negotiations with Turkey, the Eurlings report reviews the progress that has been made and the problems that have been encountered. With the tabling of certain amendments, it has been possible to balance this report so as to take account of the efforts made by Turkey and, at the same time, to highlight areas that remain problematic, such as Turkey’s failure to sign the Ankara Protocol and the treatment of minorities. As regards the Armenian genocide, it absolutely must be recognised by Turkey. This recognition cannot, however, be presented as a prerequisite for accession, in view of the Copenhagen criteria. As regards the paragraph on the possibility of enhanced cooperation between the EU and Turkey in the event of a breakdown in negotiations, such a move is not appropriate at the moment. We are in the midst of an ongoing process, and we cannot be pessimistic right from this stage about the conclusion of the negotiations. With this vote, I want to show the considerable progress that Turkey must make in order to join the European Union, but, in doing so, I do not want to create any further obstacles to its possible accession. In my opinion, Turkey’s entry into the EU represents both an opportunity for Turkey and an opportunity for Europe.

Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, I should like to begin by thanking our colleague, Mrs Krehl, for, and congratulating her on, her report and, in particular, on her first own-initiative report, which has enabled the European Parliament to voice its opinion on the guidelines on cohesion fairly early on, with the aim of being heard and of having an influence on the second version that has been proposed by the Commission and that we are debating. It must be stressed, in fact, that the procedure has been slightly surprising. While, at Community level, we had not yet adopted the strategic guidelines, the Member States were already in the process of preparing to adapt nationally. Admittedly, the Member States were motivated by a legitimate desire to use the new Structural Funds from 2007, but this at the risk of a lack of overall consistency. Indeed, the regional policy reform took place not only in the difficult context of the expansion and the renewal of the financial perspective, but also in the context of the revival of the Lisbon Strategy, something that clearly reoriented the objectives. The fact is that reorienting them exclusively towards innovation, the knowledge-based economy, competitiveness and entrepreneurism is not enough to guarantee the objectives of territorial cohesion and sustainable development, which seem to me to take priority. I deplore in particular the fact that the earmarking of the appropriations in relation to the Lisbon objectives, together with the classification of expenditure, should not have been made subject to the agreement of the European Parliament.

I should like to pay tribute to the outstanding work of my colleague, Mr Sifunakis, regarding the protection of the European natural, architectural and cultural heritage in rural and island regions. As the elected representative of a rural region in which the natural heritage is protected, the architectural heritage is ancient and the cultural heritage is rich, I appreciate the importance of this report. I also believe that the multifaceted character and strong identity of the heritage of our rural and island regions is what sets them apart and makes them rich. I fully endorse the report’s recommendations in relation to the measures aimed at suitably protecting, rehabilitating and promoting small traditional communities. The necessary resources must be harnessed both from the Structural Funds and from the appropriations earmarked for the environment and the national allocations. All European initiatives such as the ‘European Union Cultural Heritage Prize’ and the ‘European Heritage Days’ must be encouraged and made more widely known in order to promote the diversity and richness of Europe’s heritage, as a factor of social cohesion. Furthermore, I believe that more importance should be attached to preserving and passing on the regional languages, dialects and patois of our rural and island regions, as these are also part of our heritage.

 Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I would like to start by commending the hard work of our rapporteurs and fellow Members who have made it possible to improve the Commission's proposal from the perspective of partnership, non-discrimination and, above all, balance between the regions of the old and new Member States. It is, however, regrettable that the sums devoted to this major EU policy do not match our ambitions. In addition, whilst urban policies have been at the heart of a number of debates, the same has not been true of the rural world, the future of which is now linked to the second pillar of the CAP, even though its appropriations have been drastically cut. We therefore need to ensure that the Structural Funds mesh well on the ground with the new agricultural Rural Development Fund. Finally, I find it regrettable that the Council has decided to earmark the appropriations of the regional policy for the Lisbon objectives on a massive scale, and, what is more, that they did not really consult Parliament regarding the classification of the spending. We must remain vigilant, to ensure that the operational programmes in our regions are sufficiently flexible to take account of structural investments, which are still necessary, and of social solidarity. Finally, I would remind you that, whilst this reform must, of course, contribute to the objectives of competitiveness, it must, above all, contribute to economic, social and territorial cohesion.

Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, as draftsman of the opinion of the Committee on Agriculture and Rural Development on the renewal of the Institutional Agreement, I should like to express my dissatisfaction with the budgetary agreement concluded on 4 April. Indeed, in the budget negotiation, heading 2, 'Preservation and management of natural resources', obtained an extra EUR 100 million under a reserve for forthcoming measures in the fields of Life + and of Natura 2000 and nothing more, despite the efforts of the negotiating team, to whose work I pay tribute. Besides the fact that this does not by any means settle the Natura 2000 network's funding problems, I should like to highlight the fact that no answer has been given to all the other remarks and criticisms contained in my opinion, which was virtually unanimously adopted within the Committee on Agriculture and Rural Development. I would point out that one of the main aims of the CAP reform, which was decided in September 2003, was to freeze the first pillar in order to strengthen the second pillar, namely rural development policy. However, it turns out that the package earmarked for rural development has been reduced by some EUR 20 billion in comparison with what the Commission had proposed, which, in the regions of the 15 old Member States, represents a 35% decrease in relation to the current 2000-2006 period. That is a huge decrease and comes on top of the reduction in the Structural Funds. This is clearly going to result in more people leaving our rural areas and, indirectly, in the problems within our towns and suburbs becoming more acute. The first pillar, for its part, is going to come under strong downwards pressure: compulsory and optional modulation, financial discipline, reform of the common organisations of the market and WTO negotiation. The 2003 agreements have therefore been completely disregarded, and the balance that was struck is being called into question before the 2008-2009 revision period is even looked at. Like Mr Mulder, I also want to stress that the optional modulation in these unconditional procedures resolves nothing. On the contrary, it is going to present some serious technical problems and create distortions of competition; I regard the Interinstitutional Agreement's concluding statements on this subject as being very weak in comparison with the risks taken. As far as I am concerned, this is the start of a renationalisation of the CAP; I will therefore vote against this agreement. (Applause)

 Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I must first commend our rapporteur, Mr Kindermann, for his outstanding report. It is crucial that the importance of forests in the EU be taken into account, in compliance with the subsidiarity principle, on account of the area that forests cover in the rural environment, their position in the rural economy as a complementary sector of activity to agriculture and their role in landscape planning, for example in preventing, and limiting the impact of, natural phenomena such as flooding and erosion. There are several reasons why an EU forestry strategy would make it possible to establish sustainable development in forests. Firstly, it would help mitigate climate change and would contribute to sustainable energy supplies, in particular biomass. In this regard, I welcome the agreement reached at the Ecofin Council authorising the application of a reduced rate of VAT for the production of heat and refrigeration from wood. In practice, such a reduction should encourage the development of this renewable energy source and of new outlets for the wood sector. Furthermore, forestry activities also create wealth and jobs, whether this be … (The President cut off the speaker

 Mr President, Commissioner, I must first congratulate Mrs McGuinness on her outstanding work, and I wish to commend her for her willingness to listen and her openness. This new strategic approach on rural development is designed to channel resources along well-defined priority axes. I feel that this will help to improve the effectiveness of measures in rural areas and coherence between the Member States. It was also important to reaffirm the importance of rural development policy as the second pillar of the new common agricultural policy. Nevertheless, as draftsman of the opinion of the Committee on Agriculture and Rural Development on the financial perspective, I am dismayed to note that the sum proposed for funding rural development policy, some EUR 20 billion, represents a sharp drop in relation to the Commission’s proposal. The solution put forward by the Council to address this significant reduction is the optional supplementary modulation transfer of up to 20% from the first to the second pillar, and this is left entirely to the discretion of the individual Member States. This proposal raises a number of concerns: firstly, this modulation is technically impossible for market expenditure; secondly, it would mean drastic reductions in direct aid; lastly and most importantly, the fact that this optional modulation would comply with neither the EAFRD regulation already adopted by the Council after seeking an opinion from Parliament, nor the strategic guidelines on which we shall be having our say tomorrow, would be unacceptable. As with the EAFRD funds and the funds based on mandatory modulation, there must be national cofinancing and compliance with rules on minimum spending per axis and integration with national strategic plans.

 Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I would like to start by congratulating Mrs Rothe on her excellent own-initiative report, which clearly calls upon the European Commission to draw up a legislative proposal on increasing the share of renewable energy in heating and cooling by July 2006. Heat and cooling networks and biomass, particularly woody biomass, are important outlets for the timber industry, fit in perfectly with a sustainable European forestry strategy and can support European efforts towards sustainable development, particularly the aim of 12% of all energy consumed being from renewable sources by 2010. However, there is currently no legislation governing the use of renewable energy for heating and cooling, and this gap must be filled following the publication of the European Commission's biomass action plan on 7 December last year. I would like to emphasise three points that I see as important. First of all, on 28 January, the Ecofin Council concluded a political agreement to extend the experimental reduced VAT rate on labour-intensive services until 2010. The important new aspect for the subject we are now discussing is the inclusion of district heating in the option provided for in Article 12(3)(b) of the sixth VAT Directive, under the same heading as the supply of natural gas and electricity. The Member States can therefore now put an end to this disparity in the tax treatment of sales of heating energy and subscriptions to heat and cooling networks using renewable energy, and the supply of natural gas and electricity. I fully support the rapporteur's recommendation regarding the use of the Structural Funds, the Cohesion Funds and the European Agricultural Fund for Rural Development (EAFRD).

 Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, while I welcome Mr Marques’s work, I would like to comment more specifically on the report on the role of territorial cohesion in regional development. First of all, I would like to congratulate Mr Guellec on his excellent work and the pertinence of his comments on the concept of ‘territorial cohesion’, which seems to me to be at the heart of Community regional policy, which is now referred to more and more frequently as cohesion policy. The Constitutional Treaty makes territorial cohesion an objective of the European Union, in the same way as social cohesion and economic cohesion. Thus, even though the ratification process experienced some difficulties, as we know, this constitutes official recognition of the relevance, currency and importance of the territorial aspects of regional and cohesion policy. The latest enlargement also confirms the urgent nature of this. In my opinion, regional policy primarily aims to reduce development disparities at local and regional level and thus constitutes an indispensable counterbalance to convergence and economic competitiveness policy. However, cohesion does not stand in opposition to convergence and competitiveness: these concepts must be and remain complementary. While ensuring that the development of Europe’s most dynamic regions is not hindered, so that they can play their part as the engine of the European economy, the main aim of the cohesion policy is to help the most disadvantaged and underdeveloped regions. The reformed regional and cohesion policy must also be integrated in the Lisbon Strategy but, above all, ensure solidarity and equality between areas and the visible continuity of the efforts previously agreed to in the old Member States. Therefore, to achieve harmonious and sustainable development of the European territory, we must attack territorial imbalances. We must take into consideration the diversity of the European area and the often cumulative handicaps of certain areas, be they natural, historical or demographic, such as low population density or imbalances in the age pyramid or in the active population. We must measure the additional costs faced by these regions and help them so that these areas have the same development opportunities as others and so that the people who live there are not penalised. Of course, that requires resources and I hope that the financial perspective will soon reach a favourable outcome, so as to give the regional policy an adequate budget and to help the areas that still need it.
 Bernadette Bourzai (PSE

Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, the Community’s regional policy exists just as much for the sake of cohesion among Member States as of cohesion between the different European regions. Solidarity requires us to direct the bulk of the Funds to the new Member States, but we must also remember that certain regions of the old Member States still need to gain the benefit of the leverage effect produced by the Structural Funds in order to implement projects of structural importance and to consolidate the progress they have made in their development. I therefore support the Commission’s proposal, because it offers a fair balance between focusing the funds on the poorest regions – and therefore on the new Member States – and giving attention to the poorer regions of the old, wealthier Member States. To disturb this balance would not only be dangerous for European cohesion, but it could also heighten the phenomenon of European citizens’ disaffection with the European project, because European regional policy is the most visible and best- known policy in our countries. I therefore wish the Council a rapid and favourable conclusion to the negotiations on the financial perspectives in order to equip regional policy with an adequate budget and to assist the regions which still require help.

Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I support Parliament’s motion for a resolution, which echoes the Council’s position of 23 and 24 May of this year. I shall not revert to the account of recent events in Uzbekistan, but I should like to reaffirm the need for a rapid and determined response by the European Parliament to the extremely serious situation for the local population, and particularly for the refugees. In view of the tragic events in Andijan, I would firstly stress the overriding need to set up an international commission of inquiry as soon as possible, to clarify what happened and oblige the Karimov government to face up to its responsibilities. Additionally, the Union must act with the NGOs and the office of the High Commissioner for Refugees to ensure that refugees on the Kyrgyzstan border are well treated. The European Parliament must also urge Uzbekistan to implement in-depth reforms and put the country on the path to true democracy and economic development for the benefit of all of its citizens. The proliferation of arbitrary imprisonment and the use of torture and execution must stop, once and for all. Respect for freedom of expression, and freedom of the press, but also freedom of NGOs, are preconditions for the smooth running of our partnership and cooperation agreements. I should like to emphasise that the ferment of popular demonstrations and confusion in Uzbekistan is rooted in depressed economic and social conditions, in poverty and in powerlessness in the face of corruption. Should we use a stick and carrot approach? If the Tacis programme, with scrupulous monitoring of the allocation of funds, is to continue, we can remind the Karimov government that partnership and cooperation agreements are subject to strict compliance with the clauses on democracy and respect for human rights.

 Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, many things have been said in the previous speeches to which I will not return. Overall, I agree with the content of the draft common resolution that has been proposed. Nevertheless, I would like to stress the importance of three points. First, economic and social difficulties were a major trigger for the events in Kyrgyzstan. This is because the situation of considerable uncertainty and poverty formed fertile ground, favourable to the spread of demonstrations and to the overthrow of the government of Mr Akaev, who had been making himself rich off the Kyrgyz economy since 1991. Unacceptable practices, including corruption and nepotism, increased the silent but legitimate discontent of the people, who aspire to an improvement in their situation, and we must pay attention to these aspirations. Thus, if we are going to support the ongoing process of transition to democracy, we must pay particular attention to the honesty and transparency of the elections, and to the implementation of a policy of dialogue and national reconciliation. Only a stable, legitimate government will be able to successfully complete the reforms that are necessary to improve the situation of Kyrgyz citizens. Next, the stakes in relation to human rights and fundamental freedoms constitute another crucial aspect of the current situation. The European Union must satisfy itself that the democratisation process is based on true political pluralism and also allows the media and NGOs to operate freely and independently. The cooperation projects launched by the OSCE and as part of the TACIS programme must be supported and encouraged. Finally, I think we need to broaden our thinking in relation to the events in Kyrgyzstan to a regional perspective encompassing the whole of Central Asia. The democratisation of Kyrgyzstan could thus be seen as a hope, an example that the other countries of Central Asia, suffering from violations of human rights, can follow. The recent toughening of legislation aimed at NGOs and opposition groups calls for an attitude of attentiveness and of particular vigilance by the European Union faced with the changing political situation in the region.

We have all worked very hard over these last few months to arrive at a package that is, I think, consistent and of high quality. Admittedly, the negotiations have not been easy either in Parliament or with the Council and the Commission, but opinions have changed a great deal since the first vote in parliamentary committee, where content-related issues completely overshadowed the rest of the elements of this package. Therefore, in Mr Harbour’s report, the many advances obtained for consumers had practically no mention. I hope that it will be different this time, not only because the compromises achieved on fundamental freedoms and respect for privacy are good, but also because this dossier has tremendous potential both for consumers and for the telecommunications sectors and their employees. The compromises reached on the framework-directive and the Universal Service Directive make clear reference to the obligation for Member States to respect the principles of the right to a fair trial, which must surely be reassuring for those who oppose the French project of sanction by an administrative body. These texts are anything but a Trojan horse for the graduated response, and even oppose the very principle. Another concern is the neutrality of the Internet and the issue of limiting access. The final text is very clear on this matter. Any policy for network management is justified only for the purpose of maintaining a minimum level of service quality and should not lead to discrimination between services and applications, everything being under the control of national regulatory authorities. I want also to emphasise what we have achieved for consumers in the context of the Universal Service Directive. Henceforth, it will be impossible for an operator to hide behind issues of technical feasibility as a reason for not providing reliable access to emergency services and to the location of anyone using the emergency number 112. This vital point for the safety of European citizens will finally be sorted out; it has been technically possible for years, but the authorities and the operators preferred to sacrifice safety on the altar of making savings on investments. The same goes for improving the transparency and quality of contract-related information to be provided on a mandatory and regular basis. Consumers will be able to benefit from pricing information matching their consumer profile and also to warning messages where they exceed their normal price package, which is particularly useful with special tariffs for use abroad or for young people, who are major users of premium rate SMS. The duration of contracts will henceforth be limited to 24 months, with an obligation for operators to offer 12-month contracts, and in the event of a change of operator, this will have to take effect within one day. We have achieved maximum access for disabled users as well as a review of the scope of universal service in order to extend it in particular to mobiles by next year. Ladies and gentlemen, I hope that we will vote for this final text, which is the culmination of months of negotiations, without letting ourselves become too troubled by concerns which, although understandable, in view of the fundamental importance...

 Mr President, Mrs Vassiliou, ladies and gentlemen, we are going to give our verdict on a text for which I have been hoping and praying for a long time, especially in the framework of my report on the impact of the exclusion of health services from the Services Directive. However, I am afraid the recent vote has left a bitter taste in my mouth. The report, as adopted in the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Food Safety, with the support of most of the political groups except the Socialists, is in fact, with some improvements, merely a response to the Court of Justice’s decisions. Not only does it not respond to the major challenges for health policies in the Union, it also does not solve the issue of legal uncertainty for patients and enshrines a market approach to healthcare. In relation to legal uncertainty, it seems obvious to me that the vagueness prevailing between the respective conditions for application of this directive and Regulation (EEC) No 1408/1971 and, soon, of Regulation (EC) No 883/2004, adopted yesterday, will only give rise to new decisions from the Court of Justice. As for the market approach, the spirit of this report can already be found in summary in its legal basis, in other words Article 95 governing the rules of the internal market. Health would therefore only be a commodity like any other, subject to the same rules of supply and demand. That can only lead to unequal access to care, where well-heeled and well-informed citizens are able to choose the best care available in the EU, whilst the rest would have to make do with services that are already weakened in many Member States, and which this directive is by no means designed to improve. In the same spirit, Amendment 67 amounts to introducing competition between the national public health systems, as each person would be free, providing they pay, of course, to join the system of their choice in the EU. I would like finally to raise the question of prior authorisation for hospital healthcare, the introduction of which is subject to a whole series of limitations on the Member States, even though this principle allows both control of the financial equilibrium of the social systems and a guarantee for patients about the conditions for reimbursement. For all these reasons, and because I have few illusions about the outcome of today’s vote, given the wonderful unanimity... (The President cut off the speaker)

I found the compromise on the Thyssen report too lax where safety rules and the presence of chemical substances in toys were concerned. Furthermore, the amendment calling for the conformity of toys to be monitored by independent bodies was not passed, even though it seems obvious that the safety of children should be prioritised over the interests of one or two large industrial groups. I have always been in favour of stricter monitoring of goods in general, and even more so in the case of goods designed for children. It follows that the final disappointing content of this text – it falls far short of our initial ambitions, even though it contains a few advances – has led me to abstain from the vote.

 Madam President, Mrs Kuneva, ladies and gentlemen, we shall be voting on the necessary revamping of a 14 year old directive affecting millions of people in Europe, both professionals in the tourist industry and consumers of timeshare holidays or holiday clubs. This industry, worth more than EUR 2 billion a year and employing 200 000 people, is a major driver of the internal market within the framework of the Lisbon Strategy, particularly as forecasts indicate rapid growth for this kind of service. The economic rationale, while not insignificant, should not impede greater protection of the countless users of these services, who often have moderate holiday budgets and need protection and more legal clarity. The harmonisation of conditions for withdrawal from a contract, as well as the prohibition of unfair commercial practices, such as advance payments during the cooling-off period, and the requirement to provide an accurate, clear and legible contract in the chosen language of the purchaser, therefore constitute significant progress in consumer protection and empowerment. This text will at last enable us to put a stop to unacceptable practices made possible by the inadequacies of the current directive, and will reinstate credibility in an industry crippled by a negative image. We therefore have reason to hope, on the one hand, for fresh positive dynamism among traders freed from unscrupulous competitors and, on the other, renewed confidence for reassured consumers. I am therefore keen to congratulate the rapporteur, Mr Manders, and the shadow rapporteurs, in particular my friend, Joel Hasse Ferreira, on their successful work which will lead, at first reading, to an agreement which preserves the many advances sought by Parliament but rejected by the Council.

Mr President, Mrs Bachelot-Narquin, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, following my own-initiative report on health services that Parliament adopted on 23 May 2007, the Commission is now proposing, as part of the social package, a directive addressed solely at patients’ rights in regard to cross-border health care. I am, therefore, very sorry this text shows so little ambition and does not take account of the many internal challenges that need to be resolved in order to combat the growing inequalities in the health sector, such as the ageing population, social inequalities, geographical segregation and medical demography problems. On an issue that is so vital to the citizens of Europe, the Council and Parliament cannot, therefore, simply codify the Court of Justice’s rulings. We need to find a certain balance, which will safeguard both the rights of patients – who are not merely consumers – to cross-frontier care, and equal access for all to quality care, with solidarity-based responsibility; to ensure social and territorial cohesion and respect for the principle of subsidiarity. There is still a worrying grey area in relation to definitions, such as prior authorisation and the concept of hospital care. We need clarification here, so as not to open the door to discrimination that might give rise to a two-speed health system within Europe instead of creating added value in Europe. Health has no price but does have a cost; the directive, on the other hand – and that is a good thing – reaffirms both the principle of subsidiarity and the need for closer cooperation to bring the medical research networks and patient information centres closer together. The debate will begin; it must be an in-depth and fruitful debate, rather than a precipitate one, and must be shared by all the players involved, with the object of constructing a genuine European social model.

 Madam President, Ministers, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, after months of discussions, which have not yet been concluded, I think I can say that, as a result of the work done by Mr Harbour and the shadow rapporteur, we have reached compromises that have consumers’ best interests at heart. Accordingly, it is essential to encourage better competition by implementing a number of measures to require telecom companies to offer contracts of acceptable duration and to give effect to number portability within one day for subscribers wishing to change to a different service provider. In terms of protection, the general rules on consumer protection must apply to the telecom sector; cost-control mechanisms have been envisaged as well as improvements to out-of-court settlement procedures in the event of a dispute. Another very important issue is access to emergency services and the provision of caller location information, which must be made available in a reliable manner, regardless of the technology used. Protection of privacy has also been a priority, as has child protection: access providers must provide customers with free parental control software. All these developments had to be secured for the benefit of as many people as possible. Many measures therefore apply to equal access for users with disabilities and people on low incomes; the needs of SMEs have also been taken into account. The report also emphasises the need to extend the scope of universal service, particularly to include broadband; it is very positive that the French Presidency has made this issue one of its priorities. I should now like to turn to the question of content and copyright which has tended to overshadow the rest of the improvements in the text. Our aim has always been to provide consumers with general information on infringements of copyright, in line with the Commission’s original proposal. We shall be working right up to the final vote to improve the wording of the compromises by ensuring that the principle of neutrality in providing access to content is upheld. Some amendments adopted in the Privacy Directive, however, are really causing problems and we shall make sure that they are deleted. I should like, once again, to thank my colleagues, and I am looking forward to more specific proposals from the Presidency in order to make further improvements to this text before the next part-session.

Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, this report is not as anodyne as the late hour at which it is being debated might suggest and I want to thank Mrs Svensson for the work she has done and for her cooperation. Marketing and advertising are ubiquitous in our society and contribute to the creation of social constructs that sometimes have adverse effects, in the form of discrimination or the retreat into simplistic gender stereotypes. Advertising is certainly also a source of creativity and such representations are sometimes used intentionally for humorous purposes. But advertisers must not forget that they have an important educational role to play, that we must develop the critical faculty of young people, with a view to eliminating all forms of discrimination resulting from what are at times degrading images based on gender that could put the dignity of the individual at risk. The purpose of this report is not to question editorial or creative freedom but to encourage the actors in this sector to improve existing self-regulation systems, to cooperate with the competent authorities to improve the codes of good practice and to be aware of their responsibilities in relation not only to gender equality but also to physical and mental health, which is sometimes threatened by pressures arising from criteria of beauty that are set as the desirable norm. That is why I ask Members to reject the many amendments seeking to delete parts of the text, since it would then lose all its substance.

Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, I want to begin by congratulating Lasse Lehtinen on the excellent work he has done and on his capacity for listening. His report sets out to improve a Commission strategy that is already based on the principles of protecting and empowering consumers. I support the horizontal approach advocated by the rapporteur as a means of reconciling the protection of consumers – and especially the most vulnerable consumers – with an efficient internal market. Likewise, it is essential that consumer organisations should be given a greater role in preparing legislative proposals. In relation to product safety, the Commission not only needs to pursue its market surveillance efforts; it also needs to act quickly to establish principles for a CE marking system that will offer a genuine guarantee of quality, traceability and safety. Lastly, it is essential to improve access to redress by proposing a European system of collective redress that will allow consumers to exercise their rights in full where there is proven harm, while at the same time avoiding the pitfalls of the US system. Voting in favour of these things can only strengthen public confidence in a European market model that is both open and protective.

Madam President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, European consumers expect the products they buy to enjoy better safety protection. All too often we hear on the TV news that such-and-such a product from a country outside the European Union poses a risk to safety or health. This package of measures is an impressive response to such problems, and I should like to highlight the work done by our three rapporteurs during the negotiations, in insisting on the importance of consumer protection. In the current product-safety climate, new legal instruments are an absolute necessity. I would draw your attention, in particular, to the oral question that is to be asked concerning revision of the rules on use of the CE marking. The marking has, until now, been seen by European citizens as a sign of confidence and an assurance of safety, whereas it is actually no more than a declaration by the manufacturer that the product complies with European legislation. This means it has too often been affixed willy-nilly and used improperly. We have only to think back to the Mattel toys affair. I am very keen to see a proposal from the Commission for an additional mark that would give the system greater credibility and improve consumer information, with a view to making imported products safer. I have no doubt, however, that Commissioner Kuneva is committed to addressing this matter. She has always indicated her support for improving consumer confidence. What we need – and what Mrs Schaldemose’s report proposes – is tighter market surveillance to prevent abuses of the marking system and to clarify the responsibilities of importers and manufacturers, because ultimately they alone bear the responsibility for putting on the market products that are safe, and we are well aware that cooperation between national market surveillance authorities and customs services is very uneven. The overriding priority is to make importers directly liable for the safety of the products they import. Currently it is very hard to take sanctions against them because in some cases, by the time that problems come to light in Europe, manufacturers have closed their factories and disappeared. It is a situation we can no longer accept. I would like to conclude by thanking Mrs Schaldemose for taking account of the circumstances of small and medium-sized companies in relation to conformity assessment procedures. The challenge is to strike the right balance between procedures that could be burdensome and over-costly for micro-enterprises, including the craft sector, without absolving them from their responsibilities.

 Six years after the arrival of the euro, Europe still did not have a single market in terms of banking that would benefit consumers and give them a more tangible experience of the advantages of the single currency. Information about interest rates and credit terms and conditions will be standardised to make it easier to compare offers. Consumers will thus be able to choose in full knowledge of the facts, and obtain the best credit terms. Lenders will also have to give consumers clear information about the advantages and disadvantages of their credit offers. The questions of the right of withdrawal in the case of linked credit (immediate delivery of the goods) and of the amount of the penalties imposed if the credit is repaid early are clearly framed. These penalties must be ‘fair and objectively justified’. They may not exceed 1% of the amount of the credit repaid early and will not be permitted on loans at variable rates. I am particularly pleased that the Member States can say, as is currently the case in France, that no compensation may be demanded for credits of less than 10 000 euros, and that is why I voted in favour.

 Madam President, they are killed because they are women. These murders known as feminicides are caused by a social context influenced by a patriarch mindset that prevents women from becoming socially independent. The extremely well balanced report by Mr Romeva, although it refers more specifically to feminicides in Latin America and Mexico, forms part of a global strategy to eradicate and prevent violent deaths of women all over the world. That is why I voted in favour: the EU must promote and defend the values of gender equality. My amendments, which were in fact taken over by the rapporteur, had focused on support for the victims’ families, who are often completely helpless and, to make matters worse, they endure the pain of seeing these murders go unpunished. I therefore wish to call for awareness and training programmes dealing with gender problems and for measures to promote the creation of effective protection systems for witnesses, victims and their families, psychological support, and free legal aid.

 Mr President, Commissioners, ladies and gentlemen, in the summer, Mattel recalled 20 million toys from China, thereby reopening the debate on the value of CE marking and sanctions against operators who do not meet European standards. What will it take before the EU reacts? Brazil has already banned imports. The United States and Canada are starting an inquiry. As for us, we are debating. The Commission must take action. This means: revising EU legislations on toys before Christmas, insisting on the need for maximum harmonisation; ensuring that manufacturers comply with safety standards, as well as social and environmental standards – why not introduce a new European label to reinforce CE marking?; reviewing the effectiveness of controls and penalising manufacturers if necessary; clarifying the responsibilities of producers and importers; stepping up market surveillance through real customs cooperation between Member States. The responsibility and credibility of the EU in the eyes of consumers is at stake. How can we encourage consumers to have a positive image of Europe if we cannot restore their confidence?

By abolishing the reserved area, which made it possible to fund the universal service – that guarantee of a quality public service for all – and by creating disharmony with funding methods that each Member State is left to decide on, the total liberalisation of postal services will result in the loss of solidarity between urban and rural regions, the enrichment of shareholders and an increase in local authorities’ public debt. I therefore voted in favour of the amendment aimed at reintroducing the reserved area, which satisfies more than 70% of Europeans. As a member of the Socialist Group in the European Union, I am in favour of a ‘postal’ Europe that consists of modern public services, but not at the cost of the loss of jobs and of human and regional solidarity. The paradox of this proposal is that, without a new directive, liberalisation will take effect on 1 January 2009. An amendment rejecting the text proposed by the Confederal Group of the European United Left/Nordic Green Left makes this liberalisation effective on 1 January 2009, because, at this point in time, it is the 2002 directive that applies, and that alone, and that is why I did not endorse this amendment. I did, however, vote in favour of the amendment rejecting the text that, moreover, abolished the date of 1 January 2009. I did, of course, vote against the final text.

Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, the European Parliament has always been committed to setting up a common asylum system by 2010. The report by Mr Pirker, whom I congratulate for his excellent work, points out the necessity of maintaining this objective. The purpose of creating a common asylum policy must be the protection of the individual and not the reduction or externalisation of asylum applications. European policy must be based on the obligation to admit asylum seekers and the principle of non-refoulement, in accordance with the Geneva Convention. Working out a uniform status, improving the quality of decision-making, single European procedures on compilation and examination, common use of information on countries of origin, and improving cooperation between Member States will, I hope, allow people whose situation requires urgent protection to enter European territory in complete safety and to see their application examined as it should be. Nonetheless, the need to improve cooperation in relation to information on countries of origin should not be limited to keeping a generalised list of third countries, as the reliability of such a list would be uncertain. On the contrary, assessment case by case on the basis of the rights of the individual needs to be introduced. Europe must also share between the different Member States the burdens and responsibilities of its asylum and immigration policy by helping countries such as Malta, which are no longer capable of absorbing further influxes. Furthermore, I pointed out with concern, as draftsman of the opinion of the Committee on Women’s Rights and Gender Equality, the total absence of gender issues in the European Commission’s communication. Aspects relating to women’s rights as well as protection of minors are completely ignored. The same goes for the rights of homosexuals and transsexuals. I consider also that gender-based persecutions, that is marital and domestic violence, female genital mutilations, sexual abuse, crimes of honour, rape, forced marriages and crimes resulting from enforcement of Sharia law, must be legally considered as sufficient reason for granting asylum. The Commission must establish practical criteria for granting asylum or a special humanitarian status for women suffering violence of this kind. I also highlighted the need to put in place special training for people authorised to admit asylum seekers, in particular women, children and older people, and to provide reception centres suitable for these people. I am delighted that the rapporteur has taken note of this, although I regret that his report devotes only one paragraph to these concerns relating to gender, which seem to me to be of vital importance’s the more so because we can no longer ignore the lack of respect by most reception centres for the basic human rights of the individual. I realise, however, after listening to the Commissioner, that this is a subject he feels strongly about, for which I thank him, and so I have high hopes.

Madam President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, health services constitute one of the pillars of the European social model. That is why they have been excluded from the Services Directive and must be dealt with in their own right, as part of a more wide-ranging assessment of the health sector in Europe. The Commission consultation cannot be reduced to patient mobility alone, but should be an opportunity to define what the role and the added value of the European Union might be when it comes to guaranteeing every citizen not only equal access to health care, but also a high level of health protection, in accordance with the powers of the Member States and with the principle of subsidiarity. European health policy cannot be limited to the mobility of patients and health professionals and cannot aim solely at the implementation of an internal market in health services, as this would lead to a two-speed system, from which only the most well-off patients would benefit and where health care institutions would seek to attract the wealthiest patients. Furthermore, due to the disparity in professionals' income, medical demography problems will undermine access to health care in the Member States in which service providers do not earn as much, with these people being tempted to settle abroad. Patients must have the right to receive health care in another Member State, in accordance with freedom of movement, but there is no question of promoting medical tourism. Although health services are subject to the rules of the Treaty, they cannot be considered as ordinary commercial services because they are invested with a mission of general interest. There needs to be a balance between freedom of movement and predominant national objectives connected with the management of hospital capacity, the monitoring of health care expenditure and the financial balance of social security systems. Furthermore, the Member States remain responsible for organising, planning and funding their health care systems. All European citizens, whatever their income and place of residence, must have equal and affordable access to health care, in accordance with the principles of universality, quality, safety, continuity and solidarity. That is how we will contribute to the social and territorial cohesion of the Union while ensuring the financial sustainability of national health care systems. Patient mobility must not in fact serve as an excuse for the Member States to neglect their own systems. The Court judgments have, according to how matters have turned out, introduced a number of concepts that are worthy of clarification. This is the case for the distinction between hospital care and non-hospital care, as well as the notion of reasonable waiting time. I regret that the Commission has made only fleeting reference to the mobility of health professionals, when this subject requires in-depth examination. The shortage of staff in European health services will only get worse over time. What is more, we are faced with an ageing population. Is it sensible, then, not to tackle this issue starting today? I do not think so. The Union must commit itself to providing comprehensive information to patients, so that they can make choices with full knowledge of the facts: who can care for them and according to which procedures? It is from that moment on, when all of these procedure- and criteria-related issues have been resolved, that we will truly have on our territory ‘European patients without borders’. In terms of cooperation, the Union could encourage the implementation of a European network of reference centres, or exchanges of knowledge between the various countries regarding the best treatment methods. It is regrettable that the consultation should have described social services in a restrictive fashion, because, when it comes to integration, there is a dimension to these services that goes beyond mere assistance and action to help the poorest people. Furthermore, the artificial distinction between health services and social services of general interest ignores the reality of the services that are provided. In many cases, social services and health services are provided in the same way. This is particularly the case where health services with social support are concerned. What about the provision of medical care for old people’s homes and specialised institutes for disabled people? Contrary to what the Commission consultation was implying, the judgments of the European Court of Justice no more stipulate that Parliament must limit itself merely to codifying the case-law than they prevent it from exercising in full its role as legislator. The decisions of the Court, taken as they are with reference to specific cases, are not enough to define a health policy. Decisions must be taken as part of the democratic decision-making process. In view of the countless number of infringement proceedings brought by the Directorate-General for the Internal Market in the field of health care and of the unsatisfactory legal situation in which the user-citizens find themselves, we need, for consistency's sake, to lay down a directive on health services that spells out the common values and the principles applicable to health care systems in the Union, and this, so that the citizens regain confidence in Europe in one area of their everyday lives – health care – for their health is their most precious asset. The added value of the Union can be crucial in this sense and can also give impetus to the Lisbon Strategy.

Social services of general interest are a key component of the European social model. The European Commission communication on these services includes the prospect of clarification of the place occupied by SSGIs within the European Union with regard to social aspects, concepts applicable to these services and the legal certainty that should be granted to them. The models of organising and managing SSGIs do in fact vary greatly across the various Member States. One of the aspects on which the Commission must focus is that of the creation of a legal instrument and, more specifically, of a sectoral directive, in order to ensure that the procedures are politically clear and to guarantee legal certainty for the social organisations concerned. Holding a forum led by Parliament under the Portuguese Presidency, in cooperation with all of the social partners, will enable this objective to be achieved. SSGIs have a major part to play in turning the social dimension of the Lisbon Strategy into something concrete, by the volume of jobs that they create and by the social cohesion that they help to provide in various ways throughout the European Union. For all these reasons, I have voted in favour of the report by Mr Hasse Ferreira.

Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, health services, which have been excluded from the Services Directive, constitute a crucial pillar of the European social model. They contribute to social, territorial and economic cohesion, are a mission of general interest, and are also consistent with the Lisbon Strategy. The Commission consultation must not be reduced to the free movement of health services, or aim at simply implementing an internal market in these services, as this would lead to a two-speed system, from which only the well-off and best informed patients would benefit. The consultation must provide an opportunity to clearly define the role and added value of the Union, in order to guarantee a high level of health protection while respecting the national characteristics and powers of the Member States. The mobility of patients and professionals must be guaranteed, with respect shown for the following fundamental values and principles: universality, solidarity, quality, security and durability. It is imperative that a European legislative framework and, more specifically, a directive on health services, be adopted in order to increase the legal protection of patients, health professionals and health insurance systems and thus to restore the confidence of all Europeans in all Member States.

 The progress made when it comes to equality between men and women in the field of education is mainly quantitative. From now on, we need to fight for a qualitative improvement and for a change in attitudes, paying particular attention to the situation of girls and young women, who are the victims of two-fold discrimination. I therefore voted in favour of the report by Mrs Flasarová, which recommends to the Commission and the Member States that they put in place a policy targeted at national, ethnic and cultural minorities, ensuring in particular that a multicultural approach is adopted and permitting access to high-quality education, and this with a view to preventing two-fold discrimination. The report also asks the Member States to make the option of lifelong education available to women and men who choose to look after their children and to make it easier for women to obtain jobs involving responsibility and decision-making. Finally, the Member States and the Commission should use all the means available to them to eliminate the stereotypes that contribute to discrimination against women in the workplace.

Globalisation is giving rise to negative consequences for the most vulnerable and least qualified workers in certain sectors. Relocations are producing a climate of harmful social uncertainty for social progress. Businesses are benefiting from a new kind of freedom that flouts borders, leaving hordes of often poorly trained employees jobless, people who will have the greatest difficulty in finding work again. Eleven thousand jobs have been relocated over the last 12 months in France. The fear of relocations is spreading from region to region, at a rate of almost 1 000 job cuts per month, a figure that is more than enough to fuel social unrest. I voted in favour of Mrs Bachelot-Narquin’s report because it provides an initial response to the legitimate worries of European workers. The creation of a European Globalisation Adjustment Fund (EGM) will provide an annual sum of EUR 500 million in aid to workers who have fallen victim to international restructuring, with the aim of getting them back to work. The assistance provided by the EGM should thus provide solidarity and support to workers who have been made redundant because of changes in the structure of world trade, even though this fund will probably prove to be insufficient.

The Community action programme in the field of consumer protection for 2007-2013 is intended to complement, support and monitor the policies of the Member States. It will contribute to protecting the health, the safety and the economic and legal interests of consumers, and also to promoting their right to information, education and organisation with a view to defending their interests. The actions will contribute to guaranteeing all of the Union’s consumers a high level of protection and to ensuring the effective application of the consumer protection rules. I am delighted that this programme has been divided into two parts, thereby distinguishing between health and consumer protection. While I regret that the Commission has reduced the financial envelope from EUR 233.46 million – at first reading – to EUR 156.8 million and that the number of actions in the field of consumer protection has been reviewed and reduced from 20 to 11, I have voted in favour of Mrs Thyssen’s report, so that consumers’ organisations can benefit from this programme in the interests of our fellow European citizens.

 Accessibility of public transport and information and communications technology is vital for people with disabilities, who have a right to better integration in education and in the labour market. The rapporteur rightly recommends a European charter on ‘quality of support for people with disabilities’. That is why I voted in favour of the report by Mrs Lynne, which also highlights the need for European legislation on the rights of people with disabilities to have access to all modes of transport, on the model of the laws in force for air passengers with disabilities. We must break down prejudices. Information campaigns should be devised to encourage employers to give unprejudiced consideration to taking on people with disabilities, particularly in the light of false notions about the financial cost of this type of employment and about the abilities of candidates. Member States should ensure that the management of disability is offered as a new service for businesses. In terms of prevention, this would ensure that those affected by disabilities in the workplace would keep their jobs; in terms of rehabilitation, it would help them to get back to work.

Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, even though many advances have been made in comparison with the initial text presented by the European Commission, the directive on services in the internal market that has been submitted to the vote today differs from the European Parliament’s first reading. I therefore voted to reject the common position. Indeed, services of general economic interest are still part of the scope of the directive, as are some services of general interest. The scope of the exclusion of social services of general interest is also far more limited. The fundamental rights guaranteed by the European Charter now only feature in a recital. Finally, the text remains ambiguous as regards the exclusion of labour law. While the written statement presented by the European Commission provides some of the necessary responses to these issues, which I consider to be essential, it does not have any legal value, and, in the event of a legal dispute being brought before the courts, the Court of Justice will be unable to take it into account. It would have been different if this statement had come from the Council, as colegislator with Parliament.

 There are 25 national legislations governing mortgage credit, and soon there will be 27 standing in the way of a common European approach. This Green Paper issued by the European Commission will finally make it possible to carry out proper studies of this issue and to go for the sensible options. Any Community measure concerning the European mortgage credit market must, above all, be of direct benefit to the public. However, consumers often come up against too many obstacles, be they legal or economic. In voting in favour of the report by Mr Purvis, I opted for making the mortgage credit market accessible to a larger number of potential borrowers. In the Committee on Internal Market and Consumer Protection, I had, in this connection, personally pushed for its rapporteur, Mr Medina Ortega, to take account of borrowers with insecure and insubstantial credit profiles, workers on fixed-term contracts and first-time buyers.

 It is a fact: the directive on the posting of workers has not been properly implemented in some Member States and is not fulfilling its objectives. This is due to variations in the interpretation of certain key concepts (worker, minimum wage and subcontracting), the difficulty of monitoring compliance with the directive, and the difficulty of obtaining information, both for workers and for SMEs. If we are to have an effective system of cooperation between the Member States, we need to increase the participation of the social partners, provide posted workers with more information on their rights, and provide businesses, particularly SMEs and craft enterprises, with contact partners. Finally, it is now vital for the European Commission to look into constructive solutions to prevent and eliminate unfair competition, as illustrated by 'PO box companies' or double posting from one country to another, and the social dumping resulting from the improper posting of workers, in particular by means of 'sham self-employment'. This is not about changing the acquis
 of the directive, but about improving it. That is why I voted in favour of Mrs Schroedter's own-initiative report.

Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, Mrs Weiler’s report provides the clarity and transparency that we needed in relation to public-private partnerships, and thus allows us to change the wayward paths taken by the European courts and to improve the legal clarification for all of the actors concerned. Concessions are all too often mixed up with public contracts: the latter concern the purchase of goods consumed by local authorities, while concessions offer public authorities the opportunity to delegate the completion of part of their tasks to a third party. Therefore, we should have a law on these concessions and not a mere interpretative communication. The same is true of institutionalised PPPs. Their creation is currently being threatened by the rigours of case-law, which tends towards having two calls for competition when allocating work, something that is likely to seal the fate of semi-public companies. I am therefore grateful to our rapporteur for having requested a legislative initiative on this subject. Finally, in the Commission versus Spain judgment, the inter-communal structure has become a private partner for the Court of Justice. Authorities should therefore make inter-communal structures to which they delegate the provision of services compete with each other. Mrs Weiler is re-establishing the law and offering us the best parliamentary contribution on this subject, and for that I thank her.

I believe it is important to create an Agency for Fundamental Rights that is both independent and accountable. It is necessary to strike a balance between these two requirements while bearing in mind that the main objective is to devise a functional and effective body. If that objective is to be achieved, active cooperation among the three European institutions will be indispensable. It is, first and foremost, a matter of reaching a political consensus. The Council, however, has let it be known that it does not wish the powers of the European Union Agency for Fundamental Rights to be extended to the third pillar, in other words to intergovernmental cooperation in the fields of policing, justice, immigration and anti-terrorist activities. The Netherlands has even announced that it will use its veto to prevent the agency from starting its work on 1 January 2007 because it would duplicate the efforts of the Council of Europe. For this reason, while I voted in favour of the whole package of amendments to Mrs Gál's report, I nevertheless came down in favour of deferring the final vote to let the Council reconsider its position.

 Mr President, Mr President of the Commission, ladies and gentlemen, I should like to pay tribute to the work of our rapporteur, Mr Rapkay, which has helped to revive this debate on services of general interest. I support completely his proposals to create greater legal certainty for social services of general interest. I also support those on the provision of high quality services throughout the EU at optimal cost, respecting social balance and guaranteeing lasting security of supply. I am however much more sceptical when it comes to asking the Commission for clarification on applying rules regulating competition and the internal market to public services. Mr Barroso, whom I would like to thank for attending the debate, has just confirmed for us the supposed benefit of this competition for consumers. As the rapporteur has pointed out to you, since public services lack a clear legal framework, their funding and management are dependent on uncertain circumstances offered to us in turn by the Commission and the European Court of Justice, which change hats as they see fit and act interchangeably as judge, legislator and executive. For at least 15 years now Parliament has been asking the Commission to legislate. What have we achieved? The Commission is proposing a choice between a simple communication to strengthen the legal certainty of these services and a multitude of sectoral directives. Personally, I want a framework directive: a legal framework giving services of general interest a positive and not simply dispensatory status, and one that the market competition rules will then be bound to respect. Key sectors such as education, health and water must not be liberalised, and mixed circumstances must be allowed for where social, economic and environmental concerns are interlinked. Services of general interest reinforce citizens' feeling of belonging to Europe. They are a key element of solidarity and play a part in pursuing social rights. I do not want a Europe in which the European model is based only on fiscal and social competition between states. With this framework directive, I want to take Europe beyond the mere market, towards a society in which all public services are guaranteed as key factors in social and territorial cohesion.

Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, buying sex is not a sport. Football and sex do not go hand in hand. The European Union must call on Angela Merkel’s German government to combat the organised trafficking of women for the purposes of prostitution during the World Cup. Sex workers, whom Germany considers perfectly legal, and who normally receive many clients a day, will not be able to satisfactorily meet the extra demand of potential clients there will be from the millions of male World Cup spectators. What, therefore, could be more natural than for the sex industry to import some 45 000 women from Eastern Europe, Africa and Latin America in order to satisfy the wishes of these gentlemen? It is not a matter of going against German laws, but of putting an end to this openly organised trafficking of women. The trafficking of women constitutes a violation of the fundamental rights of the individual and, in particular, of the right to dignity and respect for physical and mental integrity and of the right not to be subjected to violence. Governments must ensure protection and respect for the rights of individuals who are victims of trafficking and, in particular women and young girls who are forced into prostitution. Therefore, we must concentrate more on the traffickers and their networks of organised crime which exploit these women, and not on the women themselves. This sexual exploitation must cease and appropriate and effective measures must be put in place against this mafia of sex. I am especially delighted by the petition launched by the Socialist Group in the European Parliament (PSE) to put a stop to this organised prostitution and this iniquitous treatment of thousands of women. I am very much in support of this initiative and strongly condemn the organised trafficking of women, which turns them into commodities. In this context, Commissioner, are you going to take into account some of our proposals, such as the launch of a prevention campaign targeting potential victims and informing them of the dangers and risks of recruitment into these networks, or the installation of a direct multilingual telephone line backed up by a vast publicity campaign?

 Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, I should like to pay tribute to the excellent work of our rapporteur, Mrs Niebler, who has at all times been careful to take account of the differing points of view of her fellow Members in order to improve this recast directive as much as possible. I therefore hope that the result obtained will not go unheeded, and will not just be a declaration of intent from the Member States, as is often the case when it comes to matters of equality of treatment for men and women. Need I remind you that a better work-life balance is a vital condition for meeting the objectives that the EU has set itself in the Lisbon strategy and regarding jobs and growth? I am therefore grateful to the Commission and the Council for agreeing to make a statement on parental leave as the European Parliament requested. I am also delighted at this agreement between our institutions, because the recasting of these seven directives on equal treatment of men and women in matters of employment and working conditions will enable us to increase transparency and to clarify what rights our fellow citizens have, particularly with regard to direct or indirect discrimination, harassment, and equality in terms of pay and occupational pension schemes. With particular regard to the latter point, I would take the liberty, Commissioner, of urging the Commission to require France to meet the commitments it made when it ratified the Treaty of Rome, which was the first to condemn all gender-based discrimination, particularly with regard to pension rights. The deadline for transposing Council Directive 96/97/EC of 20 December 1996 on the implementation of the principle of equal treatment for men and women in occupational social security schemes was 1 July 1997. To date, France is still in contravention of Community law, because the directive has still not been transposed. What are we waiting for? I am also pleased that the deadlines set by this recast directive regarding transposition and sanctions for failure to implement the text have been reduced in comparison with the initial proposal. The gathering of statistics will also give us an impression of the overall situation and allow us to assess the changes and adjustments made at European level. It is our responsibility to establish a real European policy on equal treatment for men and women, which must be effective and must be able to change mentalities quickly, since this is absolutely vital for a true transformation of society.

I am not going to get into a dispute over figures in order to explain to you why I voted against the reports by Mr Böge and Mrs Sousa Pinto, both of which relate to the financial perspective. The advocates of this compromise, which they themselves describe as 'tolerable', will not hold it against me, I hope, if I harbour a different ambition for Europe and its citizens to theirs.  I do not want a Europe that is reduced to being a mere free-trade area copied from the Anglo-Saxon model, but rather a Europe founded on the values of solidarity and of sharing among nations, something that has always been the vehicle for European progress. This financial perspective is tragically lacking in ambition for the future of the European project and merely helps to promote intergovernmentalism. With a 37% reduction under the heading of growth and competitiveness, and a 10% reduction in the Cohesion Fund, the financial perspective destroys any notion of a revival of Europe and precludes any new policy for seven years.

I should like to congratulate Mrs Thyssen, who has done an excellent piece of work. I thank her all the more because she has been willing to incorporate the amendments that I had tabled concerning relations between consumers and craft enterprises. Craft workers play a vital role everyday in terms of giving information and advice to consumers, with whom they are in direct contact. I am also satisfied that the two programmes have been kept separate: health and consumer protection. These policies are of equal importance to people, and each of the programmes can only be reinforced by this. Nevertheless, I am still extremely worried about the Council’s proposals concerning the Community’s budget for 2007 to 2013, which would lead in a few years time to a drastic reduction in the current policy for consumer protection at European level. It is unthinkable that this budget should be reduced to EUR 5 million a year in 2009, that is to say one cent a year for each European consumer. This is by no means enough to finance a consumer protection policy worthy of the name and, moreover, of fundamental importance to people’s daily lives. Nonetheless, I am voting in favour of this report.

Mr President, Mr Barroso, ladies and gentlemen, I should like to begin by paying tribute to the work of our rapporteur, Mrs Gebhardt, who has, in actual fact, succeeded in completely rewriting the text. How should I go about telling you, Mr Barroso, that Europeans have had enough of this Europe of social dumping? Using language related to the country of origin principle, perhaps? Despite some important advances such as the preservation of the Posting of Workers Directive and the exclusion of health care and services of general interest, I regret that SGEIs and social services are still not excluded. I refuse to see these public service tasks made subject to the rules of the competitive market. Similarly, it would be very useful to have labour law excluded from Article 2 so as not to cause a dangerous dispute. Even if, in the end, the country of origin principle is no longer mentioned, the proposed compromise will hand over the actual power of the legislator to the Community judge, who will decide the direction in which European social policy is steered. Applying the country of destination principle to the exercise of service activities and the country of origin principle only to the right of access would have been preferable. As for those who falsely claimed that voting against the draft European Constitution meant the death of the Bolkestein Directive, the current situation shows them that, on the contrary, this directive is still very much alive and that it requires us to be extremely vigilant and to keep on fighting.

 Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, I would like first of all to congratulate our rapporteur, Mrs Edite Estrela, who has done an excellent piece of work on which I hope you will be able to draw, Commissioner. How can we continue to aspire to making the European Union’s economy the most dynamic and competitive knowledge-based economy in the world by 2010 without eradicating the continuing disparities between men and women? Half way through the Lisbon Strategy, we can unfortunately only note a failure to achieve these objectives. The gender dimension cannot remain confined to only a few areas of this strategy. It is a horizontal and transverse element that cannot be ignored and cannot be reduced to a mere box-ticking exercise in an impact assessment. It means concentrating on the systems and structures that create and maintain inequalities and accentuate differences. Three percentage points more women than men are unemployed. 33% of women work part time involuntarily compared to 6% of men. Only 10% of women achieve high-level positions. The pay gap ranges from 6 to 30% for the same work, despite equal treatment having been a fundamental principle of Community law since 1957. If Europe wants to reach its growth and employment targets, it is time to change the way people think. Women’s working hours must remain a choice and not a constraint that makes their position insecure. Women’s access to lifelong learning must be optimised. There must be a real political will to create measures for the family that will allow men and women to reconcile professional, family and social life: more childcare facilities at affordable prices, and more parental leave for men to allow them to give themselves more to bringing up their children. We must make the gender perspective an absolute priority as a matter of urgency and fulfil the promise of a Europe based on the values of democracy, equality and social justice for all – women as well as men.

Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, I should like first of all to congratulate our rapporteur, Mrs Niebler, on the comprehensive and balanced text she has prepared. This compromise wording, with the amendments that have been made, represents an important and high-quality parliamentary contribution. Its main aim is the revision of the terms of the previous directives on equal pay, equal treatment in access to employment, training and promotion, working conditions, occupational social security systems and the prevention of harassment. This revision will enable us to present a single coherent wording, free of any contradictory definitions, to increase the transparency and clarity of the legislation on equality of treatment and to facilitate effective implementation by reinforcing the acquis communautaire
, avoiding any regression and incorporating all recent developments of European jurisprudence. By including also all the definitions of direct and indirect discrimination and of harassment, together with the principle of equality of pay and occupational pension arrangements, this text will provide the clarification and simplification that are essential to good implementation in the Member States and will ensure a high degree of legal certainty. However, I regret that, of the three main aims set out by the Commission – to simplify, modernise and improve Community legislation – the aim of effecting improvements has not resulted in any concrete proposals in the text. A vigorous policy on the protection of self-employed women, particularly in the areas of agriculture and crafts, on parental leave and on the reconciliation of professional and family life should have formed part of this objective, and I deplore its absence. I therefore ask the Commission to send a strong signal, firstly by urgently revising and improving Directive 86/613 on the application of the principle of equal treatment between men and women engaged in a self-employed activity, and, secondly, by re-examining Directive 96/34 on parental leave, in order to adapt it to the current situation through the introduction of incentives in the Member States, such as reasonable compensation and statistical recognition of the value of this unpaid work. Essential improvements have to be made to combat traditional segregation of roles within the family and to ensure a better balance of women and men in the labour market. In short, a better reconciliation of work and family life. Equality of treatment is an essential condition for achieving the goals of sustainable economic, social and environmental growth and development which form part of the relaunch of the Lisbon strategy. Europe must ensure minimum rights for all men and all women and must urgently ensure they are respected in the Member States. This aim requires us all – Parliament, the Council and the Commission – to show a strong political determination and intelligent cooperation in the service of our fellow citizens.

 Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, 10 years after the Beijing conference, reality continues to be implacable for millions of women in the European Union. Unemployment is three percentage points higher for women than for men; 33% of women are forced to work part time compared with 6% of men. Pay differentials vary from 6 to 30% for the same work. One woman in five in the EU is a victim of domestic violence, which is a serious human rights violation and one that must now be brought into the public domain. The recorded number of prostitutes has increased 10 fold in 20 years and 90% of them suffer violence at the hands of their pimps and their clients. Commissioner, it would seem to be a matter of urgent necessity to set in motion aggressive policies to provide information on rights and to enforce existing laws in the Member States as well as to implement an effective policy of controls and penalties, because it is not enough to set ambitious targets and then see nothing change over 10, 20 or 30 years. It is not enough – and this applies to us here – to salve our consciences one day a year and then despise women the rest of the time. The enlarged, reunified Europe, the land of freedom, the land of human rights, has the duty to comply with its future Constitution. (Applause)

Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, bolstering consumer confidence is one of the keys to the development of the internal market. The creation of a European legislative framework, based on an adequate level of harmonisation, to give consumers legal protection against unfair business practices will increase their confidence, whether they do their shopping locally or on a website hosted in another Member State. I am keenly aware of the need to take account of vulnerable consumers, who, by reason of various factors such as age, physical or mental incapacity, limited literacy or disability, require extra protection. I regret, however, that we have been unable to reach agreement on better protection of minors. I am particularly pleased that the country-of-origin principle has not been reintroduced in the compromise, and for this I must congratulate our rapporteur, Mrs Bresso, who has done an excellent job. The Socialist Group has always vigorously contested this principle and will continue to do so in the context of the Services Directive, because the application of this principle only generates social insecurity and legal uncertainty for the public. The adoption of this directive and Mrs Bresso’s report tomorrow is therefore of the utmost importance in the effort to protect consumers. It is an opportunity to give the internal market a human face. In this respect it would be a splendid triumph.

Madam President, Mr President-in-Office of the Council, I have discovered from your Czech historians the reason why you have not ratified the Treaty of Lisbon: they talk in fact of the magic of the figure 8, as in 2008. This figure punctuates your history, they say: in 1918 Czechoslovakia was created and, in 1348, Prague. They cite forty-odd examples and, in particular, three recent painful ones: 1938, when France and the United Kingdom abandoned you; 1948, when you were set aside by a coup d’état
; and 1968, when the Soviet tanks rolled in. So 2008, I can understand – you put it to one side because you thought ratifying the treaty that year was suspect, all the more so since some people were comparing the limited sovereignty of Brezhnev with the treaty. In spite of all his faults and his past, comrade Barroso, who is here, is not Brezhnev! (Laughter)
 We are part of a project that is characterised by its shared and voluntary sovereignty. The Treaty of Lisbon is just one moment in this history; it is just one stage in this history. I beg you: 2008 is over, ratify in 2009! (Applause)

Mr President, it would be wrong to say your Presidency was perfect, but it would be dishonest to say that it was a failure. I shall take one or two lessons from it. This is a time of conversion, because from this Presidency onwards, when the market has a problem, the State will be the solution. I hope that this conversion is sincere and sustainable and, as I am a French socialist, I am delighted to learn that the source of our problems is not the 35-hour week but the banks, and that ‘Mrs 35-Hours’ is better than ‘Mr Madoff’. The second lesson is that, at the end of this Presidency, you will have to re-establish a better relationship between France and Germany, because it was shaken at the beginning by the Union for the Mediterranean. The German Chancellor was not invited to an important meeting and then we ask her and Germany to pay, as in 1918 for reparations, or 1945 for reconstruction, or 1955 for contributions, or 1990 for reunification. Yes, I am defending Germany. Do you see that, Martin? I am defending it. You know the French saying: ‘don’t climb coconut trees when you have a hole in your trousers’. I think there is a bit of sorting out to be done and that we need to rebuild Franco-German relations. Finally, for a presidency to be successful – what a fine lesson this is – you have to surround yourself with two socialists: Bernard Kouchner, who was a minister under Mr Mitterrand, and Mr Jouyet, who worked with Mr Jospin and with Mr Delors. I am speaking to Mr Le Maire, the new minister: watch out Mr Sarkozy, he is a Villepin man. I expect you know this other saying: ‘I forgive everyone who offends me, but I keep a list!’ (Applause)

 Madam President, I am the first French socialist involved in this debate. I regret that the President-in-Office of the European Council has left, having seen fit to joke about a major party in his great country. He has every right to do so, but he also has a duty to stay to hear the response: that is my complaint against him. Equally, I do not think it a good thing for the President-in-Office of the European Council to try to create divisions in one of Parliament’s major groups. Mr Schulz responded to him. When he gibes at French socialism, just consider the target of his gibes. He forgets that French socialism gave Europe François Mitterrand, he forgets that it gave us Jacques Delors... (Applause)

 Mr President, I am a French and European socialist. This means that in Paris, I am not one of your supporters, but in Strasbourg, I am not entirely one of your opponents, especially when I see you surrounded by two social democrats. Even if my President is in the wrong in my country, he is still my President. I therefore wish the French Presidency, and therefore the European Presidency, success. Since the start I have relaxed while observing you, because I understand your desire to be in the French Parliament. What I am seeing is a head of state, certainly, but also a somewhat frank Prime Minister. Regarding the social chapter and your priorities, I think that a distinction needs to be made. There are indeed matters that need to remain national. I am thinking about pensions. However, for everything that affects employment, such as a single market, a single currency and free movement, we need to aim at harmonising towards the best that we have. A distinction therefore needs to be made. I would like to add that, in this chapter, I would have liked you to put considerable effort into establishing a framework directive for public services. You did it for restaurateurs, and it needs to be done for public services. Finally, I do not think that the European crisis is only social and democratic. I think that it is also an identity crisis. From the point when peace was obtained, freedom won and democracy established, the world as it is has made it difficult for many of our citizens to see and understand the meaning of the history of the Union. That is why matters such as culture, education, the mobility of artists, young people, students and twinning, all of those things are fundamental, because European consciousness can no longer be taken for granted. It will build itself up, and I think that these subjects need to pervade the French Presidency. Finally, obviously we are going to judge you on six months. For a French person that is fine, because in France that is a long time, as you know. So in December we will have the results. What is certain is that the Treaty will definitely not have been ratified. You wanted a simplified treaty, and you have a complicated situation, so get yourself out of it! I would like to conclude with a phrase that I have borrowed from a Polish writer, which says this Mr President, if you will allow me, ‘Being French means taking into consideration something other than France.’ That is the reputation we have, and perhaps you have too a little bit, Mr President.

 Mr President, it is now 18 June and as a Frenchman I am consumed with the call from London: resist, continue, persevere and never give up. The word ‘veto’ is written with the same four letters as the word ‘vote’, but there is no veto for the others so we must continue. Having said that, it is the sixth ‘no’ in nine referendums since the fall of the Berlin Wall. That raises questions. It is said that Europe is not social enough; it will never be social enough. It is not democratic enough; it will remain imperfect. It is too bureaucratic; there will always be technicians who are called technocrats. I think that it is experiencing a terrible identity crisis. Things were simpler before. Today, it is a bit all over the place; it is no longer too sure of its meaning, its history, its destiny, and that is what we need to tackle. To do so we need great leadership and from that point of view we are somewhat on our own. (Applause)

 Mr President, treaties are like births: some need an epidural, others a caesarean. This one falls into the second category and it will grow up as a beautiful baby, you will see. We had to have two attempts at it, but that is in the past. It is imperfect, it is incomplete, but it is better than nothing. Most of all, it brings to a close the reunification of the continent, which began on 9 November 1989. In its way, it also brings the Second World War to a close. Of course, it is being accused of firmly establishing a liberal Europe. It could have been totalitarian, no less! I hope that this Treaty does not mark the end of one period, but the start of another. I am already looking forward to finding out who will be the President of Europe, because the whole world will be watching to see who is chosen, and the person will create the institution. Already I want to say to that person: ‘Do not stay in your office. Go all over Europe, not just to the capital cities but to every region of Europe.’ I would like to say to him or her: ‘Go all over the world. Go to the places where freedoms are ignored, human rights are restricted, and there is still war and conflict. Show that Europe has a name, a face, an address, a telephone number.’ I think this person, whether a man or a woman, will have a decisive role. We will see what will be done with this post. There will already be a rendez-vous in June 2014 – five years on. Either the Treaty will have been a good experience, will have proved effective, and citizens will have appropriated it, or the taste for Europe itself will have been damaged. That is why the forthcoming parliamentary term will probably be a decisive one as far as the commitment of citizens to Europe is concerned.

 President-in-Office, you have come before us with modesty. You have even mentioned potential errors, and admitted to possible naivety. Within the context of the Troika, I suggest you pass on this sense of humility to the French President, who will succeed you. I have just one message for you: teach Europe some of the best lessons from your history. You are Celts – me too! You have been dominated by Bavaria, coveted by the Republic of Venice, incorporated into the Austro-Hungarian Empire, occupied by Napoleon – my apologies for that one – divided up between Germany, Italy and Hungary and integrated into the Yugoslav Federation, and you have been independent since your referendum in 1990. What a history! Who is better placed than you to talk about intercultural dialogue? Who has greater credibility than you to do so? So make it a higher priority. You have placed it fourth; I suggest you move it up a rung or two! Having said that, please do not restrict intercultural dialogue to interreligious dialogue. Also think about the contribution to Europe made by those who believe that religion and politics should not be mixed, because history has shown that when one meddles with the other, it always leads to problems. To conclude, if you would permit me, in the spirit of what I have just said, I would like to read a short passage from your national anthem to our fellow Members, because it is beautiful! ‘God’s blessing on all nations, Who long and work for that bright day, When o’er earth’s habitation no war, no strife shall hold its sway; Who long to see, that all men free no more shall foes but neighbours be’. That is the spirit of your Presidency, and that is the spirit of Europe. I am French, and I am not going to give up the Marseillaise, but for six months I am very happy to be Slovenian! (Applause)

 Prime Minister, when we speak of the future of Europe, history is never very far away. It was quite straightforward for our fellow citizens while the Berlin Wall was there. We knew where the threat lay for it had a location and a face. We were the vanguard of freedom, even right next to Franco, and anyway it was not necessary to talk about borders because they were drawn by an Iron Curtain. This sectioned Europe off nicely, and that was the end of it. Nowadays I feel the future of Europe lies in its geography. We need only take a look at our surroundings. We are right next to the world’s battlefield, from Gaza to Kabul. They need some European spirit of reconciliation over there. We are also in close proximity to the hunger zone, the world’s land of pandemics, Africa, which you also mentioned. Some sharing has to be done there, for it is here we can control the migratory flows. Then we also find ourselves in close proximity to a region that has been showing signs in recent years of religious fanaticism. I do not include everyone, of course. Here, at the same time, we must call for a dialogue of cultures and not of culture shocks. We are also in close proximity to oil and gas reserves. We need them. This means that part of our prospects depends on secure supplies and energy independence. These are a few explanations we could give to our fellow citizens who are a little lost here. Modern Europe is located at the centre of continent nations. There are no empires any more. You had one, and so did we. There are some bits of it left here and there. There are no blocs anymore. Europe must be given a new direction. This cannot be achieved by simply adding directives. Some broad prospects must be outlined in order to rebuild or attempt to rebuild a kind of European dream. This is my partial vision of the future of Europe. Finally, I wish to beg your indulgence, Prime Minister, for next year is the two hundredth anniversary of Napoleon I’s Spanish campaign. Since you are an acquaintance of mine, and next year includes the French Presidency, please be indulgent with us.

 Mr President, ‘nothing is possible without men; nothing is lasting without institutions’. So said Jean Monnet, and it applies very well to our situation. Is the Treaty perfect, then? Of course not! Jean Monnet has an answer for this too. On the Treaty of Rome, he wrote that he did not ask himself whether the Treaty could have been better as it corresponded to all that was possible at the time and to the wisdom of the age. 1957-2007. Are we taking the risk of starting again? No, of course not. There will be no third treaty. One crisis is enough. Two is too many. Jean Monnet again has the answer: ‘I have always thought that Europe would be made through crises and that it would be the sum of the solutions to those crises.’ That is what the Treaty is. However, obviously not everyone agrees, since our British friends are so keen on opting out. I live on a peninsula, so I understand island mentalities. However, Jean Monnet experienced this in 1951 with coal and steel. They were not interested, it was offered to them, and then they came on board. Remember Tony Blair. He signed the Social Protocol of the Maastricht Treaty. We are sure to find a British colleague to sign the Charter of Fundamental Rights one of these days. Let us be patient, and remember the Chinese diplomat who once said that he admired the wise slowness of the construction of Europe. Let us go on. Of course, I would like to finish by congratulating the Portuguese Presidency, and as I am a French MEP, I am proud of my Portuguese President and the circumstances that mean we now seem to have two for the price of one!

 Mr President, as far as the Treaty is concerned, the devil is not in the detail, he is in the ratification. We should remember Denmark in 1992, Ireland in 2001, France and the Netherlands in 2005, and even Sweden on the euro in 2003. Nowhere is safe from a no vote. Obviously each Member State is in charge of its own ratification, whether through parliamentary channels or through a referendum, but is it really impossible to coordinate the whole thing? I think that bringing all the ratifications together would prevent an endless stream of national debates and would allow European public opinion to emerge more strongly. I can suggest a date, Mr President: the first fortnight in May 2008, because this is the fortnight that saw the end of the Second World War, and sees Europe Day on 9 May, and this year it will be the sixtieth anniversary of the Hague Congress, which set Europe in motion, chaired by Winston Churchill. For us, the French, it is also the election of a great European, François Mitterrand, on 10 May. It would help a little if the ratifications were coordinated. After all, we have got rid of the symbols of the Treaty, but symbols can be put back in a calendar. Why not write them into certain dates? Because regardless of what we think of the drafting of the treaty – and our fellow member Mr Goebbels was rather harsh about this – we must at all costs nevertheless ensure that this step in European history is taken. So I put this suggestion to you: agree on this fortnight! (Applause)

Mr President, in our various countries many dramatic situations bring us back to our European obligations. Such is the case in my country, where a cargo vessel has caused the death of a fisherman. This leads us on to maritime safety, and now the French know where the Republic of the Kiribati Islands is. I would urge you to have a look at the atlas: it is not very well known, but this is a flag of convenience. The European Union must in all urgency get tough on flags of convenience, speed up legislation in the Erika III
 package, invent an ‘Erika IV’
 package on the social matter of sailors’ training and working conditions, and simultaneously arrange better coordination for action by our countries in the International Maritime Organisation. This is an old issue that rears its head at frequent intervals, but many dramas bring us back to it. I urge you, Commissioner, and the gentleman or lady representing the Council not in attendance, to step up your efforts in this direction.

Mr President, I welcome the arrival of plan B, B as in Brok and B as in Barón. That being said, we had a complicated treaty, we will have a simplified treaty, but it ought not to be too simplistic. I shall take two examples: the symbols and the Charter. We read that the symbols are going to disappear: the anthem, the flag, the motto. This is not good news because the people of France are going to see that the outcome of their vote has resulted in the disappearance of the flag just when the President of the French Republic has put it on his official portrait. The symbol counts. It is a feeling of belonging. Try at the very least to keep the flag. As for the Charter, I would very much like my fellow countrymen to have access to three texts: the Declaration of the Rights of Man and of the Citizen of 26 August 1789, the Universal Declaration of Human Rights of 10 December 1948 and the Charter of Fundamental Rights of 29 October 2004. This is a corpus, a whole. We must promote belonging and not argue about matters of sovereignty or loss of sovereignty, and there must not be too much regression, though there will be some. As for the people of France, think of those who rejected the treaty and who are going to be disappointed, but think also of those who endorsed it and who could be frustrated. (Applause)

 Mr President, Madam President-in-Office of the Council, the declaration made me think back to certain Europeans – to Robert Schuman, since you have used his method of a declaration drafted under conditions of the strictest secrecy, which can be a very fruitful approach. Another reason why I thought of him was that, although his father was French, being born during the war meant that he was born German; his mother was a Luxembourger, and French was only his third language, yet he ended up as President-in-Office of the Council. I also cast my mind back to Alcide De Gasperi, who was born Austrian and served as an Austrian parliamentarian in the time of the Austro-Hungarian Empire, before becoming an Italian one. These two men were frontiersmen, and it is frontiersmen such as they who are the makers of Europe, for frontiers are the scabs that form over the wounds of history, and we are here in order that those wounds may never be reopened. Then I found my thoughts turning to you three. They turned to you, Mr President, the scribe of peace, for you are of my generation, a son of a Europe at peace rather than in the flames by which it had previously been consumed, a man with your own personal wound. As for you, Madam Chancellor, you are, for a Frenchman like me, the Chancellor who came from over the wall, over what is now a tourist trail and was once a barrier, while you, Mr Barroso, are the President of recovered liberty, who has changed since the age of 18, when, politically speaking, you were a bit red around the edges. Looking at the three of you – I do love that declaration, and this is an anniversary, after all – I said to myself: ‘Even so, they do have something wrong with them; they are not socialists.’ Then, though, I remembered what Guy Mollet, who was a Socialist and President of the Council in 1956, said: ‘If you are going to make Europe, don’t wait for it to become Socialist first’. And, yes, it is indeed a damn well-made piece of work!

 Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I do not know whether it was deliberate or accidental, but the day chosen to open the European Council, 8 March, is International Women's Day. It was a good choice on Mrs Merkel's part, and I expect that she will be able to make the most of the day. I would like to put the European Council back in its historical context: 2007-2010 will, I think, be decisive years, rather like 1954-1957, between the failure of the Defence Community and the relaunch of the European budget by the Treaty of Rome, the 50th anniversary of which we are now celebrating. We have many meetings ahead of us: institutional, budgetary, electoral, with the European elections and perhaps referendums, a review of the Lisbon Strategy, and even meetings on agricultural policy. Therefore, we all need to make a commitment to convince the people and to bring them with us when the time comes. The people will hear us talk about competition, and they are not opposed to it. They will hear us talk about flexibility in business, and they are not opposed to it as long as workers have security. That said, there is another word I would suggest to you: harmonisation. It seems to have disappeared from our language, although it features in the Treaty of Rome. Environmental harmonisation is getting there – it is making progress. Tax harmonisation has rather ground to a halt with regard to company tax. Social harmonisation is too weak. Be that as it may, I think that we need to send the beautiful music of harmonisation floating to the ears of our fellow citizens. Equally, and like many others, I would like the Council to encourage the Commission to submit a text, a framework directive, on public services. It is certainly necessary to rebalance the market, even though it is true that nobody here is opposed to it. It would simply be a translation of the meaning that Jacques Delors gave to European integration, or at least of one of his phrases: competition stimulates, cooperation strengthens, but solidarity unites.

Mr President, Mrs Merkel, in order to reconcile our two nations with others, we struck a deal: a peace treaty. When your nation reunified, we created a currency: the currency of confidence. When the nations of Europe came together, we drafted a Constitution: a welcome treaty. And it is here that we have come to a standstill. Everything rests on you, Portugal, Slovenia and France: this matter needs to be settled in the next two years. Allow me to express a few ideas. As far as the word ‘constitution’ is concerned, do not dig your heels in; this is an issue that angers people: there are countries that do not have one and there are countries that have had too many of them. As regards the preamble, do not meddle with it too much, because people are going to argue in the good Lord’s name, and, having consulted him, ‘He’ believes it to be a very good preamble: do not change a word of it. As regards the institutions, keep the bloc, keep the core and leave it at that. As regards the charter, make it a rule of law. Our British friends may not be too fond of that idea. Perhaps we ought to give them a little time. You know full well that they always come round after a while. Let us be patient. As for the third part, let us take what is new from the social clause for public services and let us ratify more or less at the same time. You do not have a right to referendums; we are obsessed with holding referendums, as you well know. Be that as it may, let us ratify more or less at the same time. As regards the revision, be more flexible and heed Jean Monnet’s advice: ‘Nothing is possible without men; nothing is lasting without institutions’.

 Mr President, in Finland President Borrell has, to his credit, championed human rights. President Barroso has been sure to champion Europe’s energy rights. That is his duty. As would any Head of State or Government, President Chirac has stuck up for his country’s gas consumers. That is as I would expect. However, it pricks European consciences, which would have been pricked in the same way if oil from Saudi Arabia, Iran or some African country had been at issue. For me, the issue is not that of knowing whether gas can be purchased from the Devil. Purchased it will be. The issue is, rather, that of how gas from the Devil can be done without. I think that, over the next few years – and in your case, Mr Vanhanen, over the next few months – it is independence that must guide us. In the next 10 to 20 years, oil and gas must be to our independence what coal and steel were to our peace. (Applause)

Mr President, Mr De Gaulle said one should, and I quote, ‘go to the complex Orient with simple ideas’. I suggest that you apply this formula to the Constitution. I am French and I start from a premise that is probably obvious: The French will not vote again on the same text. Let us start from there. Let us go even to the end of the ratifications. Personally, I want that, it is a right for nations and it is a duty for leaders. It will probably result in a few more rejections but we shall take it to the end. That means that, whatever happens, some new thing will be needed – I say ‘thing’ to avoid words that cause annoyance. We go, therefore, to the end with as many ratification procedures as there are countries, that is to say not 25 but 27 with the Romanians and the Bulgarians, whom we are always forgetting because their accession is as good as ratified, as it is included in the Treaty. We go round all the countries, therefore, but that could begin all over again endlessly. Here, then, I agree with your idea: we have to scrap unanimity. We have to break down the barriers and to do that we have to rewrite Declaration 30 differently. In this way, if, when the time comes, for example, 22 out of 27 countries say ‘yes’ and 5 say ‘no’, the 5 who say ‘no’ either accept the majority rule or they stand down. Otherwise, we shall go round and round in circles, and from postponement to postponement and from reflection to reflection. Whatever happens, it will not be the same text and another ratification process will be needed, otherwise I wager we shall find ourselves here in the same situation year after year.

Mr President, the people of France will remember two things about the Council. The first is that when a Frenchman speaks English, the President leaves the room. The second is that when a journalist asks him if a promulgated law should be applied, the answer is ‘yes’ in Brussels and ‘no’ in Paris. ‘You had better get used to this, no matter how hard you work’: that is what the people of France have taken away with them. Trouble is brewing in this country; in the space of ten months it has been subjected to three revolts: the first one manifested itself in votes cast at the ballot boxes and expressed a form of hostility towards capitalism; the second one manifested itself in the riots in our suburbs and expressed a form of revolt against discrimination; and the third one manifested itself in strikes and demonstrations and expressed a form of revolt against all the insecurities linked to employment. From that, I deduce – and forgive me for talking a little more about my country – that, for your next Council more than for this one, and irrespective of what you did there, there is an aspiration that needs to be fulfilled, namely mutual trust. Our fellow citizens felt that there was much more of an ‘every man for himself’ attitude during that period. France must take on its share of the responsibility for this, because it is no stranger to that kind of attitude, but it is not the only one. We therefore need confidence, and trust in each other as befits its Latin roots. The Commission and the Council must follow this path. Another aspect relates to protection because, in a way, our fellow citizens fear that Europe does not protect them enough. Good luck!

Mr President, I could have been Austrian because I come from a region – Brittany – in which, in the 15th century, the daughter of the Duke was married to Maximillian of Austria. However, the marriage was unconsummated and broken off, which makes me a sixteenth generation French citizen. I used this historical reference for the purposes of capturing your attention and of illustrating a strong argument regarding the budget. Firstly, be wary of this Parliament because it is a parliament under construction, and therefore it sometimes rebels: Mr Buttiglione did not bow down to the criticism made of him. As for the dockworkers: the intention is to serve us up the same old menu, but we are not going to eat from it and we are going to cast a simple majority vote. Be wary of this Parliament. ‘Wary’ is not the right word, but Parliament can react and it can rebel. Parliament therefore needs to be given a bit of money or, rather, a bit of extra money. I am going to point out a heading that I would like to see receive a bit of extra money: citizenship, youth, education and culture. Put a bit of extra money into that! Why? Because, as a French citizen, what took place in my country on 29 May has left a deep impression on me. As far as I am concerned, 29 May is an historic date. It is not just any old date, and the debates in which I have participated have at times been harsh: it is all very well talking about the market and the euro, but you should put a few more resources into that heading. Do it for the sake of European awareness, because history is reversible. Any treaty that has been concluded can be broken. (Applause)

 Mr President, I have looked up the word ‘informal’ in my French dictionary. Informal, in French, means badly formed and inelegant. This adjective was used by Montaigne in 1580 to describe something that was difficult to define. I will let you be the judges of the Hampton Court summit and the ghost of Catherine Howard. You have not had much luck in the UK Presidency. France has said no and the United Kingdom is being asked to relaunch Europe. I think that is asking a lot. Having said that, over a number of years, a number of landscapes have opened up to our citizens, with which they have been living and have had to live, namely the reunification of Europe, the Constitution, the Charter of Fundamental Rights, the single market and the single currency. When I think of our fellow citizens, I have the feeling that Lisbon is not fulfilling this role. Today, there is a vacuum. When it comes down to it, I do not dispute the priorities of the summit: that is not the problem. The real problem is the connection with the citizens: it is as if there used to be something we shared that has now disappeared. I think that the next summit or the ones after that should enable us to rediscover a landscape that we can share with our citizens. Of course, this brings to mind the cohesion of the 25 Member States, which is sometimes called the Marshall Plan for those who are joining us, because endless enlargement and greed for funding do not escape the notice of the citizens. That is no good at all. In my opinion, it would be worthwhile, in spite of everything, to restore the word ‘harmonisation’ to the European vocabulary, given that it is, so to speak, an endangered species; this is also unfortunate, all the more so as there are still areas that need to be harmonised. We are not going to harmonise everything, but it is still possible to make progress in certain areas. And if we forget to do this, if we neglect this word and this value, the citizens will distance themselves from us. Finally, another topic is close to my heart, that of exchanges between young people. I have looked at the statistics. In 2005-2006, Europe is funding 280 000 young people as part of three programmes: Comenius, Erasmus and Leonardo. However, there are 58 million of them. Multiplying the corresponding budget by 10 would not cost us too much, particularly given that it is on these young people that we must stake European awareness.

 Mr President, I am French, but I come from Brittany, as distinct from Britain, and I even come from Cornouaille, the counterpart to Duchess Camilla’s Cornwall, so perhaps I can be forgiven. The 100 Years’ War has already been mentioned. You have even been told to do the Tour de France, even though it is an American who will win that. Myself, I say to you, ‘Turn your Presidency into Austerlitz, not Waterloo.’ When Europe experiences a crisis, it always talks about its values. The great crisis is war. The great value is forgiveness. It was forgiveness that made the treaties of the 1950s. The other crisis, of the year 2000, was greater Europe. It was the aftermath of the Cold War. The great value was sharing. And if we want to talk to the people about the British rebate, about this cheque, fine. Let us talk about values first, and then define policies. This is right in the case of employment, particularly for those who have none, as long as we do not damage employment law. This sharing is true for those who have just joined the EU and those who are going to join. They need our support. It is true for the developing countries. Bravo on cancelling the debt of poor countries. It is true for the common agricultural policy, because, for my part, I am not very happy that about a quarter of French farmers are pocketing three-quarters of European money. If you can bring some order to all that, I take my hat off to you. There is not just the Duke of Bedford; we, too, have our little dukes, in this case. However, you will not be able to do all that with 1%; it is not enough. There is not enough in the bank account. I therefore suggest that you travel to Paris. Go to see Mr Chirac. Buy him dinner. You will see, you will be reconciled. Both of you, however, and four other partners, make more of an effort, otherwise you will find that it is the ‘every man for himself’ attitude that will regain strength. And that must not happen.

Mr President, this is the second time that France has rejected a treaty of political union. In 1954 it was because of fear of German rearmament. In 2005 it is, without doubt, because of fear of global capitalism. We should see it also as an indicator for our own policies. What is to be done? I believe we should be guided by three principles. The first principle is equality between the European nations. Ratification by Parliament is the equivalent of ratification by referendum. I have added together the results of the three referenda. When the Spanish, Dutch and French votes are taken together, the ‘yes’ vote wins by 54.04% of the votes, a figure that is a consolation for me, as a Frenchman. We need equality between the big countries and the small countries, equality for all the people. Nowadays, in 2005, I am not too keen on this word ‘founders’ because you, Mr Barroso, and you, Mr Borell, could not have been among the founders in 1957, because your countries were not members. You were living under dictatorships. Others were living under totalitarian regimes. We, the French and the Dutch, had the good fortune to be free. Consequently, we need now to be careful how we use that term. If a constitution has to be adopted unanimously, then it can only be rejected unanimously. The principle must be equally valid in either case. The second principle is, in the matter of enlargement, keeping one’s promises. I am thinking in particular of Romania and of Bulgaria and of others too, but I shall also add the Balkans. We must give to the Balkan states the prospect of entry into the European Union and we must hold to it. If we block this prospect, we shall be storing up a powder keg. The third principle is that Europe still needs, and will always need, a constitution. I say this in spite of the two ‘no’ votes. In France there is a département
 that can show us the way. It is the département
 of which Philippe de Villiers is President, the Vendée
. In 1992 the Vendée
 voted ‘no’ to Maastricht, but it voted ‘yes’ to the Constitution. Mr de Villiers is completely at odds with the people of the Vendée
 whom he represents. (Applause)
 You know, there is no need to go to Brussels to find a technocrat. A technocrat is merely a technician whom one dislikes, that is all. This département
 shows us the way, so let us have confidence in the people of de Villiers’ Vendée

 Mr President, Commissioner, well done to the rapporteur for producing a report that does not present us with any major problems. I would like to take the opportunity to thank fishermen for fishing one of the best fish, sole, that nature, for some, or the good Lord, for others, has given us. Long may they continue to fish! We need to take a few lessons from this report and this proposal. First, we must be able to adapt when we need to, and the decisions taken have not been taken against fishermen. If there are more sole than we expected, we must be able to adapt to the situation and not remain restricted or stuck. Secondly, calmness in ports and confidence in the future depend a great deal on good work carried out between the fishermen and the scientists. One group does not necessarily believe the other, and, in my opinion, we need to persevere in improving relations between them. One forum, set up as part of the common fisheries policy, is, I believe, very useful: I am referring to the regional advisory councils. We must make the most of these bodies to ensure that these two main categories, the workers and the scientists, come to as good an understanding as possible. In this case, Commissioner, your work is made all the easier and we share the same aim: to maintain the largest fish stocks possible in the sea, because, without fish, there will be no fishermen and, without fishermen, there will be no fish for consumers.

 Mr President, as a French socialist and as a European socialist, I shall be voting tomorrow, with emotion and pride, in favour of the report by the two Members of this House. I shall therefore turn my speech into a tribute – a tribute to Altiero Spinelli, who drew up the first European Constitution in this democratically-elected House. I never forget that he was a veteran of the young communists and I turn to my fellow socialists and say to them ‘never forget where you have come from’. He was an old anti-fascist militant, an old federalist, and I pay tribute to those Members of Parliament who voted for this draft during the sitting of 14 February 1984. Mr Poettering voted in favour, Mr Hänsch voted in favour, Mr Wurtz voted against and Mr Vergès voted against. They will do so again, loyal as they are. If you re-read the text on which we shall vote tomorrow, you will notice that it takes up a number of elements of that old text. Let me give you some examples. Article 3 of the Spinelli report enshrines the principle of European citizenship; Article 4, respect for fundamental rights; Article 6, legal personality; Article 9, the Union’s objective of full employment; Article 34 speaks of European laws; Article 44 mentions sanctions; Article 82 of Part 4, which is Part 3 today, speaks of ratification, and I could go on. What I am trying to say is that tomorrow’s vote forms part of the context of this long history, and that this Constitution has not simply fallen out of the sky; it is part of a major historical movement. The seam was first mined over 50 years ago and yielded the raw material of reconciliation. The single currency, the euro, which is more than ten years old, was Germany’s currency of reconciliation. Let us therefore view this Constitution as a hand proffered to the peoples who have joined us again, now that the dark night of totalitarianism is over.

Madam President, Mr President of the Commission, investing means having confidence. When we do not have confidence, we do not invest. So what are our reasons? I cannot condone your presence in the Azores. Since then we have found out that the war in Iraq was based on a lie and, to use an expression which has been used a lot, do not forget the Ten Commandments. To lie is a sin: with a grain of repentance on this issue, you could have earned a tiny bit of neutrality from quarters other than those which are supporting you today. Secondly, the team: everything possible has been said about the team, or almost. You could have won a grain of confidence if you had changed part of it. You announce an agency, but you keep the money. That is of no use to anybody. Clemenceau, in France, used to say: ‘When I want to bury a problem, I create a commission’. I have the impression that we can already express our condolences. And then there is your orientation. You could have sent a small signal to the left of this House by saying: more public services in order to counterbalance competition; I will develop the services directive in order to prevent dumping; in the Lisbon strategy, I will introduce certain minimum social rights. Even with the Commission you propose, you could have made a few gestures. You have not done so, and you will therefore not have neutrality.

 Mr President, I rise to speak on statements made in France by one of the Members of this House, Mr Gollnisch. I would like to give two or three examples of remarks which he has recently made; ‘there is not a serious historian alive today who adheres completely to the conclusions of the Nuremberg trial’, ‘as to the existence of the gas chambers, that is up to the historians to determine’, and ‘I question the number of victims of the Holocaust’. Such comments cannot be allowed to go unchallenged, and I would ask you, Mr President, to refer the matter to the Bureau. These comments, made by a Member of Parliament, are an attack on the values which formed a basis for the construction of both the EU itself and the Charter of Fundamental Rights, as included in the Constitutional Treaty. I should like to say from the outset that if a debate were to be held on parliamentary immunity as a result of the legal proceedings which cannot fail to be instigated, I would be in favour of waiving this immunity.

 Mr Prime Minister, no one has called you that yet! It is not easy to know how to address you: candidate, President-designate, Mr Barroso... your designation makes the status of your presence itself something of a problem and a cause of some embarrassment. You said to us: ‘appoint me this week and you will have my programme next year.’ It is always difficult for a Member of Parliament to adjust. However, I appreciated your reference to voters who did not go to the ballot box. You in fact told us that although we represent 450 million people, we were elected by 150 million voters, while another 200 million stayed at home. What can they be thinking of today, after 50 years – although they have not all lived 50 years? What does Europe mean to them? It is a promise kept: we have created peace and democracy; the market has been achieved; some of them have the euro in their pockets. Your problem and ours today is to give meaning to the future. I believe – as do others too – that the social issue is central. You mentioned it among many others. But if you do not give that question priority by feeding into it all the matters we have raised in our groups: public services, tax harmonisation, social rights, etc., there will not only be injustice, inequality and unemployment, but, more than that, our fellow citizens who have benefited from the achievements of the last 50 years will abandon the very idea of Europe. You have the duty to write a new page of our history. I confess I am still unsatisfied.

 I supported Mr Hegyi’s report on active dialogue with citizens on Europe. Dialogue of this kind is essential, and this report lays much emphasis on the importance of local action. Indeed, it is by taking real action closer to citizens, by simply talking to them about Europe, that they can get a clearer picture of what the European Union does for them in their daily lives. Encouraging this dialogue will be key in the run-up to the June elections, especially in rural areas and among the most Eurosceptic groups, such as young people and women. The recent interinstitutional political declaration signed by Parliament, the Council and the European Commission: ‘Communicating Europe in Partnership’, is along these same lines. We can celebrate the importance that the institutions attach to this dialogue and the efforts they intend to make so that citizens feel involved in the European Union.

 I voted in favour of Mrs Krehl’s report on best practices in the field of regional policy because it contains an innovative definition of these best practices and examples of success stories, and lists very specific recommendations for all areas of EU intervention in this field. In particular, I drew the rapporteur’s attention to better accessibility of urban facilities and transport for persons with reduced mobility, and to the possibility of reconciling private, family and professional life in a better way, especially for women. We hope that these comprehensive recommendations will help and inspire stakeholders in regional policy.

 Mr President, Commissioner, first of all I should like to thank our rapporteurs, who have managed, in difficult circumstances, to put together this 2009 budget, the last before the elections in June. The cohesion policy, with 36% of this budget allocated to it, is one of the main Community policies, a genuine tool for solidarity and economic and social equity, which we must strengthen, make more effective and better promote. Indeed, it is the tangible expression of solidarity within the European area, which is the most visible on the ground, as close as possible to regions and citizens, in the areas where they live and where the European Union can speak directly to each one. Mrs Guy-Quint has just stressed the problems associated with using annual budgets, particularly those of the Structural Funds. As far as cohesion is concerned, all those involved know how difficult it is to implement European funds on the ground. Putting together dossiers is a complex and long process, which can lead to errors that are damaging to beneficiaries, the image of the European Union and even the future of this policy. Simplifying procedures, providing better information, improving the training on this new cohesion policy for the national and local operators concerned, and sharing experiences and best practices could certainly promote better use of these appropriations. After all, in this time of crisis and increasing euroscepticism, sound functioning of the cohesion policy and proper use of European funds can enable us to restore confidence and foster the sense of involvement among European citizens if they feel part of the process, provided, however, that we can improve the visibility and better explain the benefits of this policy, where it is implemented. That is the responsibility of all the Union’s institutions, in the best possible partnership.

 I supported the position of the rapporteur, Mr Cercas, since the organisation of working time is a crucial issue in the everyday lives of the citizens of Europe. The massive demonstration by European unions yesterday in Strasbourg showed their commitment to better protection for workers. Several aspects of this report caught my attention and should be defended, including, in particular, the end of the derogation to weekly working time, which is currently set at 48 hours in the European Union. Like other European socialists, I am convinced that reconciling work and family life is essential for the people of Europe to flourish. The Cercas report, with the social advances it contains, moves in the right direction by removing the overly liberal measures applied in some Member States, which would like to see them extended throughout the European Union.

 On Thursday 23 October, the European Parliament adopted at first reading the European Union’s budget for 2009. This budget falls within the particular context of the narrow 2007-2013 financial perspective – which the French socialists, moreover, refused to vote in favour of in 2006 – of the financial crisis and of the preparations for the European elections of June 2009. A budget is policy expressed in figures. Parliament has succeeded in restoring a satisfactory payment level, in spite of the Council’s desire to make bleak cuts in lines that nonetheless appear to be a priority for MEPs, such as the fight against climate change, aid for SMEs, growth and competitiveness, and citizenship schemes. In this connection, I am delighted that we have re-established a satisfactory level of appropriations for communication initiatives concerning citizens and the media. In order to prepare for the forthcoming elections and to make citizens want to take part in the vote, it is vital that they are made aware of European issues. All initiatives undertaken by the Commission and by Parliament for the purposes of explaining Europe and its added value in terms of everyday life and of preparing for the future must be encouraged and provided with sufficient resources.

Mr President, on the very day in which the political declaration ‘Communicating Europe in Partnership’ has just been signed by Parliament, the Commission and the Council, with the latter thus indicating their common will to enhance and to harmonise information on the European Union that is intended for the citizens, we are debating the 2009 budget and the ‘Communication of the institutions’ budget. For this electoral year and at a time of growing scepticism regarding the Union, raising the citizens’ awareness of European issues is crucial. We hope, in actual fact, that there will be a very strong turnout at the elections. For this to happen, all initiatives designed to explain Europe and its added value in terms of everyday life and of preparing for the future are important. The forthcoming visitors’ centre in Brussels is part of this, but I fear that certain amendments adopted in committee will delay its highly anticipated opening. On behalf of my group, I should like in fact to point out how keen we are to see substantial investment in all communication initiatives concerning the citizens and the media, especially at local level. Parliament and the Commission must be encouraged in all policies designed to increase support among the citizens for the European project.

 Madam President, following the Irish referendum, there is an even greater need for the EU to listen more to citizens and to keep them better informed about what concerns them on a daily basis, particularly now, less than a year away from the European elections, if we want to arouse the voters’ interest in European issues and ensure that a basic consensus is obtained on its aims and policies. This is a difficult time for the 2009 budget, on which Mrs Haug produced an outstanding report with her new approach to the major issues and her wide-ranging consultation. I recall from her report the points made about citizenship and information, which must rise to the various challenges in 2009 and require considerable resources in a heading where, unfortunately, the margin is small. Information is an essential democratic tool. Wherever they live, be it in an old or a new Member State, citizens need to be better informed about the realities of the EU and particularly its budget. To that end, they must be given clear, relevant and concerted messages by the principal institutions. In this respect, calls to introduce a sort of ‘European Union’ brand that would be identifiable all over Europe and would appeal to everyone seems an important factor in involving citizens in the European project.

Mr President, once again in this budget debate thanks must go to Mr Lewandowski for his very well balanced report. And once again I would remind you what an important year 2009 will be for European democracy: with both a new Parliament and a new Commission taking office, it will be a key year in terms of our institutions’ communication with the public. However, in order that members of the public should feel interested in, and affected by, European issues and should turn out en masse
 to vote, communication emanating from the different institutions will have to be consistent and clear. With that in mind and in the interests of greater efficiency, close cooperation among the three main institutions that are engaged in communication – either directly or on a decentralised basis through their representations in the Member States – is of the utmost importance with elections just a year away. Such is the thinking behind Amendment 2 to Mr Lewandowski’s report, which my group has tabled. Our aim is to be more citizen-friendly and that is a matter of real concern to all of us here in this House.
 Brigitte Douay  (PSE

 Madam President, in Mr Lewandowski’s very comprehensive report, I was particularly interested in the Parliament budget for this election year, which has consequences for the institution’s communications policy. Improving communication to European citizens was one of Parliament’s priorities for 2009. For them to feel more involved in the forthcoming elections and to get the highest possible turnout, it is important for MEPs to be closely associated with a decentralised information campaign in the Member States. We also hope that local media will be fully integrated into this campaign because they play a key role in passing on information. Parliament’s communication budget and the actions planned for 2009 should therefore make sure that they interest and directly affect European citizens, who often feel that the European institutions are too detached. Note that generally speaking these actions follow on from those begun and funded in 2008. We also hope that the new visitor centre and the web TV will soon be operational to provide better information on Parliament’s activities and to improve the relationship between citizens and the European Union.

The European Parliament has defended its priorities well at this first-reading stage of the 2008 budget, and I support what the two rapporteurs have achieved, particularly in relation to cohesion and sustainable growth. Let us not forget, however, that because the financial perspective for 2007-2013 was pitched too low it will be a poor annual budget – representing just 0.99% of gross national income. Like my political group, I deplore this situation, for it will not allow us to meet the expectations of all Parliament’s committees or to devote adequate financing to major forward-looking European Union projects such as Galileo. We have agreed, however, to support the main thrust of the information and communications policy: we will thus be able to focus on local media, which play such a significant role in conveying information to all the people of Europe. This is particularly important given the pending question of ratification of the Lisbon Treaty and preparations for the European election in 2009. As the standing rapporteur on information policy in the Budgets Committee, I welcome the possibilities that the new budget affords in this respect.

Globalisation of trade and the lack of transparency and information on the origins of the various products being marketed across the European Union means an increased risk of acquiring dangerous, defective or counterfeit goods. The joint resolution on product safety, especially that of toys, which I voted for on Wednesday, has been adopted by almost all the groups. It is another example of the commitment being shown by the European Union, and especially by the European Parliament, towards consumer protection. By calling for requirements to be imposed in respect of product safety, the integrity of the CE mark, the exclusion of counterfeit goods and the introduction of traceability this resolution will provide more effective protection for consumers, especially children. However, the call for better cooperation with the third countries concerned must not be allowed to overshadow the responsibility that falls on those companies that are placing the orders, for it is up to them to ensure that their product specifications comply with these health and safety requirements.

 Commissioner, you are embarking on an ambitious project that concerns us all. I truly hope that, in this transport debate, we do not forget the important role that transport has for territorial cohesion. You talked about access to towns and cities by urban transport. I sincerely hope that in this great debate, we remember to talk about rural areas and, as you said, incentives for local authorities in terms of rural transport, which is often overlooked.

The French Socialists have voted in favour of the Toubon report on the Single Market Review and its adaptation to the twenty-first century, since it refers to important aspects that are sometimes ignored when discussing the completion of the Single Market. Thus social and territorial cohesion and up-to-date services of general interest go hand in hand with the completion of the Single Market. We have, nonetheless, voted against paragraph 24 on the liberalisation of postal services. The report also lays emphasis on consumer protection, which is closely linked to the completion of the European Single Market and has to be guaranteed. Lastly, the environmental aspect has to be included in the requirements for the internal market, which is an asset for the European Union provided that those general principles are observed. One important point in the report is SMEs and facilitating their access to the European internal market as a whole, in view of the vital role that they and the craft industries play in European employment and innovation. I particularly support the determination expressed by the rapporteur to take active and effective steps against counterfeiting, which is a real plague on the European economy.

Madam President, on behalf of the Committee on Regional Development, I should like to stress the fact that the completion of the internal energy market must be part of the objective of the economic, social and territorial cohesion of the European Union. It must therefore be aimed at a high level of public service and must guarantee the security of supply, as well as meet consumers’ needs in full. Indeed, total competition in such a specific market as the gas and electricity market is justifiable only if prices are lower, services more widespread and customer services more efficient. I should therefore like to lay particular emphasis on the taking into account of the most vulnerable citizens and on the security of supply in underdeveloped regions, regions with natural handicaps and the outermost regions. Special attention must also be paid to border regions, which are the first to be able to benefit from the effects of the internal market. Completing this market requires total transparency and comprehensive and undistorted information on the origin of energy, particularly when it is a question of renewable energy sources. In this respect, regional and local authorities must be supported by the European Union in their efforts to promote energy efficiency and energy savings, particularly in the transport and housing sectors. I should like to conclude by thanking Mr Vidal-Quadras for having taken a number of our comments on board in his report.

I voted in favour of the Hökmark report on Building a European Policy on Broadband, because it is very important to encourage initiatives facilitating access for all to the Internet and, in general, to knowledge. In accordance with the Lisbon objectives, it is essential to develop information technologies and, among those, broadband. Even if access to new technologies in the most remote regions is an objective that the European Union has to pursue, account must also be taken of the persistent discrepancies within single regions where new technologies are concerned. There are still many villages which, being too far from urban centres, still do not have access to the Internet or which have access to it but unduly slow access that does not allow satisfactory connections, while the region as a whole to which these villages belong is, overall, well served. For the sake of cohesion, these intra-regional disparities should also be better addressed with a view to combating the digital divide.

I voted in favour of the Rübig report on roaming on public mobile networks within the Community because the positions upheld in this report are going to make it possible significantly to improve the situation of European consumers. Many European citizens, including the inhabitants of the Nord-Pas-de-Calais border area, frequently travel abroad, for professional and personal reasons, and the tariffs currently in force when they make or receive calls on their mobiles are excessive and unjustifiable. The Rübig report remedies a situation that penalises mobility. I am therefore in favour of the fixed tariffs in this report: the costs per minute that have been adopted are totally satisfactory and much lower than those currently applied. We would, however, have preferred even lower tariffs, which could have provided a better incentive for people to move about Europe. In addition to significantly reduced tariffs, the requirement for transparency that has been requested is an important principle. The Socialist Group in the European Parliament also sought greater transparency concerning the cost of calls and secured a result whereby, from now on, European citizens will be able to know how much a call received or sent from abroad will cost them.

Mr President, I, like my fellow Members, welcome the creation of this Fund, which gives great hope to employees worried about relocations and which has given rise to countless debates within our respective committees, particularly with regard to its amount, to the award criteria and thus to the risks of unfair treatment between regions that could result. However, it is important for European workers to know that the Union has finally decided to take account of the job losses that badly managed globalisation can cause in each of our countries, particularly in traditional industrial regions. I join with those who have congratulated Mrs Bachelot-Narquin and all the draftsmen on their thorough work, and I am delighted that the Fund will be operational as from 1 January 2007. Like many, I regret that the threshold for the granting of the Fund has not been lowered, that the sum is not larger and has not been definitively allocated and that the Fund cannot be harnessed for relocations within the European Union, where the majority take place. However, this Fund does exist, and we need to get it up and running very quickly because there is a sense of urgency, as events frequently demonstrate, and then we need to assess its scope and usefulness, so that we can adjust it and replenish it if necessary. I am also pleased that there is an obligation to inform the workers and the regions that will benefit from it, because anything that can help make our often sceptical fellow citizens more aware of the added value provided by the European Union in terms of cohesion and solidarity is most welcome.

This report is part of the European Union’s policy to promote research and supplements the Seventh Framework Programme on Research and Development for 2007-2013, for which I have also voted. The modifications made by this report to the rules of participation will make it possible to simplify and improve the operation and implementation of the next Framework Programme, particularly for small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs), whose participation in European research programmes will accordingly be encouraged. The report pays particular attention to SMEs, calling for more flexibility, together with rules and controls adapted to the specific features of these enterprises. I am delighted that European Union funding of SMEs is to be increased and that the report refers to more reasonable deadlines for making the payments.

The French members of the Socialist Group in the European Parliament have refused, this Wednesday 15 November, to endorse the report on services in the internal market, in other words the Services Directive. Indeed, despite the very important advances made by the PSE and the Socialist rapporteur, Mrs Gebhardt, at first reading – not least the rejection of the country of origin principle – Parliament has not obtained any guarantees from the Commission regarding a draft framework directive on public services. With this being the second reading of a text whereby there is no final vote on the complete text, we endorsed the amendment tabled by several groups (the Confederal Group of the European United Left/Nordic Green Left and the Group of the Greens/European Free Alliance) aimed at rejecting the text. Furthermore, we tabled several amendments aimed specifically at guaranteeing respect for the freedom of the Member States to define what they mean by social services of general interest. As Mr Poignant pointed out on behalf of the French Socialists, ‘the definition, formulation, organisation and actual funding of services of general interest, whether economic or otherwise, must remain a duty of the Member States and of their regional and local authorities’.

 On Thursday 26 October, the European Parliament adopted the first reading of the European Union’s budget for 2007. Amounting to EUR 120 billion, it reflects the first time that use has been made of the new financial perspective for 2007-2013, which was adopted in May 2006 and which the French Socialists did not approve, believing that it did not make it possible to respond to the great challenges of the future. In this context, the 2007 budget has turned out to be very modest, corresponding to 1.04% of the European Union’s GNI. The many constraints, both internal and international, on the European Union have led Parliament to single out priorities that should enable Europeans better to perceive the added value supplied by the EU. The Socialist Group in the European Parliament has therefore decided to vote in favour of this 2007 budget, having received assurances concerning their priorities in relation to the Lisbon and Gothenburg strategies. These priorities include, in particular, education, training, research and sustainable development. The revival of the communication policy and the emergence of new pilot projects are also encouraging in terms of the future of the European Union.

 The Community strategic guidelines for 2007-2013 have finally been adopted by the European Parliament. I voted in favour of the rapporteur's recommendations approving these guidelines. Nevertheless, during the debate I drew the Commission's attention to the challenge of cross-border cooperation, which should enable us to reduce the disparities between the Union's border regions, provided the unequal amounts being allocated from the Structural Funds as a result of the statistical nomenclature do not hinder the objective of cohesion and do not increase inequalities. It is vital that we create the conditions for balanced economic, social and territorial development on both sides of borders and pay special attention to programmes aimed at achieving cross-border cooperation.
 Brigitte Douay (PSE

 – (FR) 
Mr President, reducing the disparities among regions, and particularly border regions, is an important challenge for the Community’s strategic guidelines. With this in view, we should emphasise the actions that will have a long-term impact, such as those carried out not only within the transport and environment sectors, but also in connection with the Lisbon Strategy, regarding support for SMEs and the cross-border labour market. It is regrettable, however, that, in this quest for balanced development, the border regions underpinning regional policy should sometimes be very different entities in terms of size and population and may have significant disparities linked to the statistical nomenclature. That can in fact result in unequal amounts being allocated from the Structural Funds, and there is, then, a great risk that strengthening the competitiveness of these cross-border regions – one of the priorities of cooperation – might turn into a form of fierce competition among neighbouring regions. The inequalities in development that could result on both sides of the borders would be liable to harm the European Union’s cohesion policy, even though one of the aims of this policy is to mitigate the negative effect of having borders. How, in this case, can we enable the citizens concerned to recognise the added value of the European Union? It is therefore imperative that we create the ideal conditions for balanced cross-border economic and social development and pay special attention to programmes aimed at achieving this cross-border cooperation. Finally, I should like to conclude by thanking Mrs Krehl for her report and, above all, for her boundless enthusiasm in championing a form of lasting cohesion.

The French press has on several occasions over the last few months published reports on the damage that the counterfeiting of products and brands causes to the economy. This is the proof that this phenomenon, together with globalisation, is reaching very worrying proportions, of which the public authorities and the citizens are becoming increasingly aware. It is therefore estimated that 100 000 jobs have been lost in Europe as a result of the manufacture and placing on the market of counterfeit products. Over and above the protection of intellectual property, however, there may also be tragic consequences where health is concerned. Such is the case with regard to the counterfeiting of medicines and vaccines, which endangers the lives of millions of people, particularly in developing countries, and above all in Africa. Consumer protection is an important duty of the European Union. The Union must therefore harmonise and enhance its legislation aimed at fighting this scourge, which is reaching worrying proportions. It must also help to enhance legislation in third countries. It was therefore with great interest that I voted in favour of the resolution on the counterfeiting of medicines.

 I voted in favour of Mr Hatzidakis's recommendation laying down general provisions on the Structural Funds, and I was pleased to see that the new generation of programmes will be able to start in early 2007, which is vital for the continuity of activities in the Member States. I nevertheless find it regrettable that, following the agreement on the financial perspective, the funds allocated to the structural policy for 2007-2013 are below the initial demands of Parliament and the European Commission. With regard more specifically to the regulations, Parliament can take pride in the fact that a number of its demands have been taken up by the Council, in particular greater consideration for disabled people and sustainable development. The new regulations will allow us to pursue the European Union's cohesion policy, which aims to develop the poorest areas and to improve the competitiveness of the EU as a whole.

) The growth and competitiveness of the Union depend in great measure on its ability to develop research and innovation. In 2000 in Lisbon, the Heads of State or Government promised to promote a knowledge-based Europe and, from 2010, to set aside 3% of GNI for this. Mr Buzek’s report – that I voted for on Thursday – emphasises the objectives and the challenges of the Seventh Framework Programme for RTD. Two chapters stand out in particular in my mind, concerning regional development: the Regions of Knowledge and the support for SMEs. It is necessary to reinforce the research potential of regions of the Union by encouraging regional research clusters that link universities, research centres, businesses and regional authorities. The report also recommends reinforcing the innovation capacity of SMEs by encouraging them to join networks and by facilitating their access to the Framework Programme. In this way the report aims at making research a genuine tool for regional development, even if it is deplorable that the resources allocated to this great European ambition have been reduced by the slimming course that the financial perspectives have undergone.

The illegal copying of designs is one of the causes of counterfeiting. It constitutes a theft of the intellectual property of businesses, which distorts international trade rules and is responsible for the loss of around 100 000 jobs each year in the EU. It also constitutes a danger for consumers when counterfeit products may harm their health or compromise their safety. Lastly, it constitutes a source of fiscal and social fraud that places a strain on the Member States’ accounts. All the resources used to fight against this scourge must therefore be continually strengthened. Design protection – which characterises the creativity and innovation of businesses – is a crucial element of the battery of powers used to combat counterfeiting. Yet, the international registration of these designs is an often complicated and costly process, especially for SMEs. All the measures aimed at simplifying these procedures and at making savings will therefore encourage businesses to comply with them and will have a positive effect on research and innovation. Mr Rocard’s report on accession to the Geneva Act concerning the international registration of industrial designs is along these lines, and I therefore supported this report.

Like the French Socialists, I voted against the Böge report, which ratifies the interinstitutional agreement on the 2007-2013 financial perspective. In January, our Parliament rejected a budget that it regarded back then as mediocre, believing that it was not enough to provide employment, growth, research and the major trans-European networks with the financial levers they require. On 6 March, the Committee on Budgets, for its part, unanimously adopted a resolution denouncing this financial perspective, in the hope that the negotiations between the Commission, the Council and Parliament would result in a budget that was more in keeping with Parliament’s wishes. The budget is still not large enough now, and the budgetary wrangling needed to satisfy the justifiable and ever-increasing demands aimed at financing all of the EU policies will be very difficult over the next few years. We shall have to explain to Europeans that this tight budget is down to the intransigence of the Heads of State or Government, who did not want to grant the Union the resources for its ambitions.

 Mr President, Commissioner, as we begin preparing the 2007 budget, I share the concern, expressed by Mr Elles in his report, about the gulf between, on the one hand, the ambitions that the European Union has set itself for the future and, on the other, the budgetary regime to which it has, this very morning, resigned itself for the next seven years. Nonetheless, the indications are that, in 2007, the budgetary estimates should enable us to continue with our current policies, while at the same time launching the new generation of European programmes, relating in particular to regional policy. The fact is that, alongside the new financial perspective, new programmes aimed at regional development will be implemented, and we are gradually going to have to familiarise ourselves with these. We go on repeating that cohesion policy is essential to Europe’s overall dynamism. It must enable the regions, diverse as they are, to complete their transformation and to prepare for the future in the best conditions and, in that way, to achieve an optimum level of development. What is more, Europe’s regions occupy a central place in the Lisbon Strategy, and the new structural policy will always have to be in a position to strengthen economic and social cohesion and to reduce the gap between the levels of development of, on the one hand, the new Member States and, on the other, the old ones. It is in order to achieve these objectives that it must be provided with the appropriate financial resources. It is therefore important, as emphasised by Mr Elles in his report, to make sure throughout the budgetary procedure that the funds appropriated to this policy are commensurate with the challenges to be met. In preparing the draft budget for 2007, we shall therefore make sure that these priorities are respected and that adequate resources are allocated to them.

I firmly support the recommendations in the Titley report aimed at rolling out ‘Bringing eCall to citizens’ in the 25 Member States. This arrangement is, in fact, a key element as far as improving road safety is concerned. In the event of an accident, the response time – in terms both of making the accident scene safe and of helping the victims - is the most important requirement in terms of limiting the most tragic consequences. There are more than 40 000 tragic deaths each year on the roads of the European Union. This system, which would enable 2 500 lives to be saved each year, must quite clearly be promoted by the public authorities of all the countries and demanded by the citizens, who are increasingly calling for safer roads. It is therefore regrettable that some Member States – such as France, in which road safety has nonetheless been declared an important national cause – should be late in implementing ‘Bringing eCall to citizens’. Let us hope that the adoption of the Titley report and the publicity it will receive in the European Union will speed up the implementation by all of the Member States of this essential intelligent car system.

Mr President, as well as their health, which we have just debated, the 460 million Europeans want us to give better and better protection to them as consumers. In the context of past and present health crises, or in that of globalisation, which no longer guarantees the traceability of all products, European consumer protection policy, therefore, takes on its full meaning. The internal market cannot indeed function properly without the confidence of consumers. By demonstrating to Europeans that it is genuinely concerned for their health and safety and that it is really equipping itself with the means to take action, the European Union can improve political clarity for them. I should like to thank Mrs Thyssen for the quality of her report. The Committee on the Internal Market and Consumer Protection (IMCO) has proposed a budget of EUR 233 million spread over seven years specifically for the ‘consumer protection’ action; this budget, which is an increase by comparison with the current programme, is essential if the objectives are to be achieved, ambitious as they are given the new obligations that enlargement entails. Let us hope that these actions will not be affected by drastic cuts in the event of a minimum financial perspective because what European consumers need is a budget that is able to deliver on the policies that they expect in response to their anxieties. This would not be possible if the European Union is on a starvation diet! I deplore, however, the fact that the amendments on information and the fight against counterfeiting adopted in the Committee on Budgets were not taken up by the IMCO Committee. From the economic viewpoint, however, counterfeiting is a veritable curse as much for health as for consumers. It affects the major brand names, SMEs and all areas of economic and human activity: adulterated medicines, defective household appliances, substandard spare parts, dangerous toys, toxic cosmetics, to give but a few examples. I feel it is important within the scope of a policy for consumer protection to give better information to the potential clients of counterfeiters about the risks involved. That is why, even if the fight against counterfeiting is included in other actions of this programme, I must insist once again on this aspect of consumer protection.

Industrial restructuring is a long-standing and permanent phenomenon, which results from technical progress and improved productivity. Restructuring often cannot be avoided if competitiveness, and hence long-term employment, is to be maintained. It always has a high social cost, particularly in regions housing traditional industries in which employees who are poorly qualified and not particularly mobile have difficulty in changing occupation. The social consequences of restructuring must therefore be alleviated. That is why I voted very firmly in favour of the Cottigny report on restructuring and employment. I sincerely hope that its proposals are taken up by the Council and the Commission and that they result in practical measures. The European Union should adapt its responses, enhance the role of both sides of industry and put in place tools designed more successfully to anticipate restructuring. Increased attention to SMEs, the creation of a globalisation adjustment fund, the right to lifelong learning and so on are all measures that should enable us to show the people that the European Union is aware of their concerns and that it is as anxious as they are to obtain genuine social cohesion.

This report proposes preventing the Structural Funds from promoting measures that contribute to the relocations that have such a high social cost in our regions. It advocates establishing a European strategy to combat relocation and setting up a European Relocation Observatory to assess the real impact of European aid on relocation. This has nothing to do with returning to an administered economy, nor of damaging free and fair competition, which is the foundation of the common market. Nor is it a matter of controlling all businesses or of preventing the development of the new Member States. However, it is important to bear in mind that the Structural Funds must be tools for development and social cohesion, not weapons for a war between our regions, because, even in the richest countries in the European Union, there are still poor regions where workers watch with despair as their jobs disappear, often leaving them with no possibility of retraining.

Mr President, I should like to thank my colleague, Mr Grech, for the clarity and rigour of his report, which is both comprehensive and pragmatic. The paragraphs dedicated to our institution – the only democratically elected representation of the people of the EU, in the words of Mr Grech himself – captured my full attention, particularly those relating to visits to Parliament. The recent debates on the Constitutional Treaty and the outcome of the referendum in my country, which I personally deplored, highlight the fact that too many of our fellow citizens are unaware of the meaning and importance of the European Union for their everyday lives. Fears and received ideas often take the place of information. From my brief experience as a new MEP, I have also learnt that, each time that I have had the opportunity to receive visitors – in Brussels or in Strasbourg – no matter what their age, their origin or their socio-professional background, they have returned home convinced, I hope, of the value of the European Union or, at any rate, better informed about it and still interested in it. Of that I am sure. One well-known rule of marketing says that a dissatisfied customer tells eleven people and that a satisfied person only tells four people. So let us increase the number of satisfied citizens, because if they are better informed, they are in a better position to spread the European idea among our nations. Yet in order to do that, we must act on the Grech report and increase the number of visitors per MEP. I support Mr Grech’s request. Recently, the European Parliament’s information office for France organised a fascinating European forum in my constituency on the theme ‘A Dialogue on Europe: bringing the European Union and the citizen closer together’. Many participants regretted that the number of sponsored visits to Parliament was not higher. This is a genuine request. I have one more point to make: as far as welcoming our visitors and organising our work are concerned, our assistants have an invaluable role to play. They share our lives as elected representatives and freely make their time and brainpower available to us, but wide disparities exist among them, and their social situation is often precarious. As Mr Grech points out in his report, they truly deserve finally to be granted a genuine and meaningful statute.

 Mr President, I am delighted that small enterprises are now at the heart of Europe's activities, firstly in Chancellor Schüssel's very encouraging remarks this morning, making this subject a top priority for the Austrian Presidency. They are also at the heart of the debate in your comments, Commissioner, before the SME intergroup this afternoon and here this evening, affirming that the situation for SMEs is of great concern to the Commission and that we need to create better political conditions for SMEs in Europe. Finally, they are at the heart of the debate in this evening's discussion. In the current difficult economic climate, it is often small and craft enterprises that continue to create wealth and form the main source of employment, with local jobs that maintain social cohesion by nourishing the whole territory of the EU. The European Union must be a staunch supporter of these small businesses, by increasing the power of the Charter as a specific assistance instrument and by going beyond good intentions, as called for in Mrs Vlasto's excellent report. In order to ensure that these small businesses continue to be created and passed on, we need to reduce the administrative formalities in Europe and in the Member States; make it easier for them to access capital and European programmes, particularly on research; improve the dissemination of information on measures that help them; and encourage innovation and the fight against counterfeit goods. To do all of that, however, we need ambitious funding, so let us hope that the good fairies who have been looking into the future of these small enterprises today – this sleeping giant, as Chancellor Schüssel put it – turn their wishes into reality by allocating the necessary funds to the various actions and that their good intentions are backed up by specific financial commitments.

Mr President, Commissioner, within her very comprehensive report, Mrs Hieronymi has emphasised the importance of the Media 2007 programme’s proposals. The programme reuses the structure and the mechanisms of the current programmes, which have proved to have had a very positive impact on the audiovisual sector. The overall objectives of the future programme have been successfully adapted to the structure of businesses in the sector and to their funding requirements as well as to the development of technology and of the market in a very competitive environment. I will therefore simply highlight the fact that, with a funding package that represents 15% of the sum dedicated to promoting culture and European citizenship in the financial perspectives, the audiovisual sector and thus cultural diversity will be enhanced in a way that is advantageous. In actual fact, by pointing out that this sector is not only of great political and cultural importance, but that it also has great social and economic potential, the Commission is proposing to allocate to Media 2007 a budget of EUR 1.055 billion over the period 2007-2013 to fund its actions and administrative costs. The future Media 2007 programme would thus see the current budget for the MEDIA Plus and MEDIA Training programmes increase by more than 50%. It is the first post-enlargement programme, and the increase in the budget should enable effective support to be provided to professionals in the new Member States, who still often have reduced investment capacities and reduced access to bank lending. In its proposal, the Commission also recommends simplifying Community intervention with regard to administrative and financial procedures. Taking into account the entire set of proposals designed to improve a programme that has already proved its worth, Media 2007 deserves to be positively received, even if the package of EUR 1.055 billion is only an indicative amount for the moment, until such time as the financial perspectives are adopted. In view of the important funding requirements of a sector that, while fast expanding, is fragmented into numerous SMEs in the 27 countries concerned, it is clear that these financial perspectives are eagerly awaited. The Committee on Budgets therefore supports this new programme, which takes account of enlargement and of the difficulties SMEs have in accessing Community actions and funding. Improving this programme, which aims to put in place more flexible procedures thanks to the proportionality of requirements for recipient businesses, is also a crucial point. Thus, Media 2007 should enable the film industry and the European audiovisual sector to continue to develop their activities by rising to the challenges of global competition.

 Mr President, the upheaval experienced by the global textile and clothing industry has hit those regions in Europe where textile production is heavily concentrated particularly hard. This is the case for my region in France, the Nord-Pas-de-Calais, which has already been affected, over recent years, by restructuring and delocalisation and where this sector is the second-largest industrial employer, still providing work for more than 30 000 employees. In 2004, Parliament, in a resolution, and the High Level Group on textiles and clothing both called for a specific programme for this sector, in particular in regions in difficulty, which have a large number of SMEs and a high employment rate among women. In these regions, European aid has made it possible in recent years to mitigate the socio-economic impact of sectoral crises, to avoid job losses and to cushion the effects of economic restructuring thanks, in particular, to innovation, integration, training and the development of a modern industry. At a time when the European Union is drafting its new financial perspectives, these regions are concerned about the future of the structural funds, which have contributed to economic development. I am sure that the Commission and the Council will be keen to reassure them and to prove to them that the economic and social cohesion to which these funds contribute is one of the European Union's priorities.

 Mr President, Mr Barrot, ladies and gentlemen, I too am pleased to be able to give my opinion on such a crucial debate as the asylum package, especially on the penultimate day of the parliamentary term. Through our various efforts, and despite the adoption of the first phase of the European asylum system, we have become aware of the persistent differences between the various Member States when it comes to the recognition of refugee status. We must also acknowledge, despite the significant advances made by the directive in relation to reception conditions – as mentioned in particular by my colleague Mrs Lefrançois, whose observations I fully support – we must acknowledge that the Member States still have too much room for manoeuvre on this issue. Therefore I too would insist that, in this area – above all in this area – a way must be found to apply European solidarity. Finally, now more than ever, I wish to point out that asylum seekers and those who require international protection are vulnerable and, as such, must be given very special attention. This means, in particular, that they should not be held in detention. The debate on the Return Directive is closed; we were all in agreement. There is no need to re-open that debate when we are discussing asylum.

I welcome the adoption of the Busuttil report, even though I admit that I do not support all of the points raised in it, especially the favourable reception given to the conclusion of the European Pact on Immigration and Asylum: my group voted in favour of the removal of this reference in the Committee on Civil Liberties, Justice and Home Affairs, but we were in the minority on this issue; the same was true with regard to the increased role of FRONTEX in return operations. However, in light of the end result, I voted in favour of this report in order to speak out strongly in favour of the opening up of legal paths to immigration. I therefore support: the recognition of the need for the work of migrants within the EU; the need for increased consultation with representatives of civil society; freedom of movement within the EU following a period of five years’ residence; respect for human dignity and the application of the most favourable measures in the context of the application of the Return Directive; and, finally, and most importantly, the right to vote in local elections, a point to which the European right was fiercely opposed.

 Every child has a right to education. The integration of migrants, whether residing legally or illegally, is a priority for us socialists. We do not accept the hierarchy that the parliamentary right wishes to create amongst migrants. This is why I abstained from the vote on Mr Takkula’s excellent report on educating the children of migrants. I did so because, as it is an own-initiative report, it was not possible for us to take separate votes to call for the removal of paragraphs 5, 8 and 16, which I find absolutely unsatisfactory. It is by educating the children of migrants that we will make an important contribution to the integration of all, irrespective of their status. It is by introducing favourable socioeconomic conditions that we will be able to give greater assistance to migrants, whether they reside legally in Europe, or whether they are destined to be granted legal residence or ultimately sent back to their own country. We should not create a status for these children whereby they are not educated and are ghettoised merely because their parents are residing illegally. That is simply contrary to the international conventions.

 Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, I would like to thank Mr Fava for the remarkable job he has done over the last few months to produce this balanced text. It was no easy task and the path was strewn with pitfalls. However, I think the results are very positive and I will mention three points in particular. The sanction applies here to the offending employer, whilst the migrant is considered to be the victim. Apart from financial penalties, penal sanctions are recommended for repeat offenders, for trafficking in human beings or exploitation of minors. I believe that penal sanctions are essential and I also believe that it is up to us to ensure that regular checks are carried out so that this directive is effective. Another positive point to mention is the automatic payment of outstanding wages to the workers. Finally, associations and unions are advocating the defence of the interests of workers living in a country illegally so that they can report a dishonest employer without fear of subsequent prosecution. Of course, as with many other texts, we could have gone further but can we take the risk of threatening the compromise position when this text will already allow major advances in protecting workers and their dignity? We need to support a balanced view of the migration issue and recognise that immigration for work is more than necessary and will become increasingly so in the future given the demographic forecasts. In this context, it is therefore essential to state that the model we want is one in which immigrant workers are viewed as fully-fledged workers enjoying the same rights as workers from Member States. We must therefore mobilise to defend these rights and this is why I think we should give our support to this report, because it is a decisive step in the introduction of minimum standards and in the fight against illegal working and the exploitation of migrant workers.

I voted in favour of the Klamt report on the introduction of a ‘European Blue Card’ because, for the first time, it also offers us the opportunity at European level to move from a ‘no’ culture, the culture of fortress Europe, to a ‘yes’ culture, a culture of an open Europe, so that we can at long last develop positive management of migratory movements and grant workers a certain number of rights. This process will need to be quickly followed by the adoption of other measures in favour of other categories of foreign workers and I shall be looking out for them. We could certainly have gone even further; we would have liked to see a horizontal directive rather than a sectoral directive, but the acquis 
is there, especially the principle of ‘an equal day’s pay for an equal day’s work’, the refusal to start a brain drain, especially in key sectors such as health and education, and the doubling of the period of residency rights for the purpose of looking for a new job once a contract of employment has ended. This text therefore seeks above all to promote legal immigration channels, not a form of selective immigration, to which I am opposed.

 Today, I voted in favour of the Corbett report on the amendment of Rule 29 of the European Parliament’s Rules of Procedure regarding the formation of political groups, namely the requirement that a political group’s members represent at least one quarter of Member States (instead of the current requirement of one fifth) and that the minimum number of members is 25 (instead of 20), and I did this for several reasons. Firstly, because I think that this reform is absolutely necessary to enable our institution to operate more efficiently and to put an end to its highly fragmented state, with rules that have remained unchanged despite successive enlargements and the increase in the size of our Assembly since 2004. In addition, the solution proposed by my Socialist colleague, thanks to whose untiring efforts a compromise was reached with the majority of political groups, seems to me to be very reasonable compared to what is practised at national level within the European Union. Moreover, given the resources, both human and financial, made available to the political groups by the institution, clear representativeness also seems to me to be enough to justify this change. Finally, the purpose is purely and simply to promote a certain consistency among political forces at European level; our democracy can only emerge stronger.

Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, you are going to be disappointed. You are going to be disappointed by the brevity of my speech. Firstly, I should like us to make a technical correction to footnote 2 in paragraph 16; the last figure is ‘2021’, not ‘2022’. It is a question of arithmetic. I would also like to say a few political words in order, firstly, to thank all those who have supported me in the drafting of this report – it may seem extremely technical to you, but it is eminently political. It is very important that our Parliament vote in favour of this report, because it clarifies the future budgetary powers of Parliament as a budgetary authority. Often, you vote on the budget as a management tool, when in fact it is the very essence of politics, and Parliament’s role depends on its being implemented. That is what we wished to cover in this report; I hope that you will read it one day. May I say, however, that the new MEPs will have to grab hold of it and realise that making a European policy takes budgetary courage and that it is on this courage – which I hope they will all have and we will all have – that the future of the Union depends.

 Madam President, in November 2008, the Commission presented a recovery plan that was not up to the job, either in volume or in content. Six months on, it has to be acknowledged that the implementation of this recovery plan is almost non-existent, and I want to find out what is happening with these EUR 30 billion of recovery funds. What has happened to the EUR 15 billion announced via new actions and entrusted to the EIB? How can one reconcile a announced stimulus of EUR 7 billion through the Structural Funds and the Cohesion Fund with an announced structural budget under-spend of EUR 10 billion in 2009? Finally, as for the EUR 5 billion that we are discussing today, I would like to make four observations. Despite the pressure from the European Parliament, the Council of Finance Ministers was unable to release the EUR 5 billion for 2009, providing only EUR 2.6 billion. We are by no means sure, therefore, that the Council will be able to find the EUR 2.4 billion missing for 2010. Parliament is ready to find any possible solutions through regulatory means. However, the other political priorities must not, under any circumstances, be called into question. That will not be permitted by Parliament. We cannot accept re-deployment; that is a red line that we will not cross. It will be difficult to find these EUR 2.4 billion because, with the presentation of the Commission’s PDB, we know that a maximum of EUR 1.7 billion will be available. Moreover, the Council still has to agree to release these margins. It is therefore important, in any case, that, in the name of short-term budgetary orthodoxy and of a legal approach to budget regulation, the many Member States no longer be able to stop this entire recovery plan. A strong budget needs to be maintained for the future of the Union, and we can see – and this is my fourth observation – that the size of and the manner in which the latest financial perspectives were negotiated and accepted puts Europe’s future at a great disadvantage.

Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, it is a great pleasure for me this evening to present the report on the financial aspects of the Treaty of Lisbon, which has been ready for some time now in the Committee on Budgets. This will be the last budgetary report of this parliamentary term and my last parliamentary report. Above all, I am very pleased to see that Parliament has had the courage to present our reports in the ‘Lisbon’ package to honour the promise made to the citizens to inform them of the consequences of this treaty. A better­informed citizen is a citizen who votes in full knowledge of the facts. Speaking about the Treaty of Lisbon in this House is not a denial of democracy, rather the contrary. Its implementation will have major consequences for the budgetary powers of the institutions and financial implications. The reform is in fact important for Parliament. Apart from the introduction of multiannual financial frameworks, it should be remembered that the budgetary procedure has remained practically unchanged since 1975. It was therefore essential for the Committee on Budgets to analyse these modifications and verify that they were the conditions needed for our institution to maintain, even strengthen, its role as a budgetary authority. That is the whole thrust of this report: simplification and clarification of the budgetary challenges of the Treaty. My main desire was to defend the prerogatives of the parliamentary institution. Future Members must not be dispossessed of their powers in future budgetary procedures and future negotiations on the multiannual financial framework. These substantial modifications are of three types. First of all, modifications to the primary legislation. The new budgetary procedure includes real advances and new challenges for Parliament with, firstly, the removal of the distinction between compulsory expenditure and non-compulsory expenditure. Next, the single reading for the budgetary procedure with the introduction of a revert mechanism in the event that the Council rejects the common position, the introduction of a conciliation committee responsible for preparing the common position and a tight timetable for the conciliation committee. In addition, changes are made to the new multiannual financial framework that strengthen Parliament’s role. This framework is becoming restrictive. To be adopted, it requires unanimity in the Council and the consent of the European Parliament. I would add that its adoption is the result of an entirely new and special procedure. With regard to the new financial perspectives, we want them to have a five-year lifespan to coincide with Parliament’s and the European Commission’s terms of office. The commissioners will thus be more accountable for the budgetary choices that they make. Codecision is extended to the adoption of the Financial Regulation and to its methods of application. Unfortunately, however, the decision on own resources remains with the Council. Parliament is merely consulted, except on the methods of application. Budgetary discipline, therefore, returns in part to Parliament, which can reject the multiannual financial framework. This is real progress. The challenge for the future Parliament is to know what will be negotiated under the new Financial Regulation procedure, the responsibility for which Parliament shares, and what will fall under the legislation for the new regulation on the Interinstitutional Agreement, which Parliament will have the right merely to reject or accept. Finally, the Union’s new responsibilities will create new funding requirements. First of all there will be the External Relations package with, in particular, the creation of the European External Action Service and the High Representative Vice-President of the Commission, and, then, the new policies: energy, space and tourism, research, civil defence, administrative cooperation, and sport. Ladies and gentlemen, as you will have understood, the changes implied by the Treaty of Lisbon are important.

Mr President, this debate has been really interesting and passionate. Allow me, however, to take a humorous look at what Mr Kamall said just now, because to call us old people – and hence fossils – as we retire to leave room for the young, is absolutely delightful. However, what I wanted to say to all those who have vilified this draft treaty is this: do not confuse democracy with demagogy! You see, for eight years in this Parliament, throughout Europe, we have been living not through a psychodrama, but through a political tragedy where Europe is floundering, and we can clearly see that we are avoiding the current problems. This debate strengthens my conviction that this treaty must be implemented, despite all the difficulties which have been raised, because, through its content, it will bring transparency. It will bring democracy, and we all need this democratic shock in order to re-focus the European project on politics, and the politics of the 21st century applied to today’s world. The budget, in this respect, is only a tool, but it will enable us to ensure that the institutions can be re­balanced and, through this transparency, we will be able to know the attitude of Parliament, of the Commission and, above all, of the Council. This political will is indispensible. This transparency is indispensible in the fight against the cancer of national selfishness, which has been eating away at the European political project for so many years. This transparency, I hope, will instil belief in all of Europe’s citizens again, and will enable us to develop information better, because this is very difficult. Mrs Wallström, you have been working on this for years, you are starting to make headway, and you have to persevere. All of that requires conviction, time and, above all, political courage, which we are lacking. We must recover that political courage and that utopianism, the utopianism of the founding fathers of the European Union, of those who believed that peace could be born out of war. In our own way, today, in the 21st century, we must take up this challenge, and one of the tools that will help us to do so is the Treaty of Lisbon. Let us reclaim utopia, and utopia for peace!

Mr President, on 14 and 15 March I, as a member of the Committee on Budgets, travelled with Mr Botopoulos to the Peloponnese regions worst hit by the floods of summer 2007. We discovered, to our great surprise, that the EUR 89.7 million pledged and due to come from the European Union’s Solidarity Fund have still not arrived in those areas. We therefore formally draw the Commission’s attention to this matter and we should like to know where the implementation of the decisions taken by the budgetary authority is being held up. How is it that this aid, which was voted on several months ago, has still not had any significant impact on these regions, where the need for European solidarity is becoming more obvious by the day? Aside from the retrospective monitoring carried out by the Commission, we should like to receive some explanations from the Greek Government regarding the use of this European aid. This really is a matter of urgency – human and economic urgency. Two years is really far too long to wait.

 Mr President, Commissioner, first of all I would like to remind you that this debate is part of a long process that is several years old: European Commission consultations; the ‘health check’ of the common agricultural policy; the fourth economic and social cohesion report; and the Lamassoure report on ‘own resources’ for the budget. Our European Commission has announced its intention to present, at the latest in autumn 2009, its main guidelines for this revision, which has given rise to some remarkable work by our Committee on Budgets, under the leadership of Mr Böge. We know that this revision will be carried out once the next European Parliament is in place. It is not our current Parliament that will carry it out. I would therefore stress a basic political point, namely that we have almost achieved unanimity so that the future financial framework tallies with the political mandate of the future Parliament, and that is an arrangement that we would like to see perpetuated. This seems very important to me because, finally, we will have consistency between the results of the elections and the budgetary guidelines to be overseen by the Commission. Next, I wish to remind you that the opinion of the Socialist Group in the European Parliament is that the budget should be refocused on the fundamental missions: employment, growth and innovation, as our colleague Mr Färm said. However, before finishing I would like to make a point of saying that the real future of the Union depends on this revision, and I hope that the future Parliament makes use of the Böge report so that it is able to achieve our European ambition in the face of the national self-interests relayed daily via the prevarications of the Council. It is up to Parliament to issue European policies that give all of our fellow citizens real hope in a project that is political and not just economic.

Madam President, Commissioner, Mr President-in-Office of the Council, ladies and gentlemen, the report by our fellow member, Mr Florenz, perfectly sums up the results of our long deliberations on this major problem of global warming. We all know that the plans to be implemented are huge and that, above all, we must give ourselves the means to change our culture of unbridled development by promoting changes in our economy. The problem now is to find out how we can implement all the report's recommendations. We must urgently find means of fighting global warming. The European Union's current budget is insufficient to achieve the related objectives; neither will we be able to resolve this major funding problem by calling on national budgets or private funds. The European Commission estimates that an annual investment of EUR 175 billion is required to fight global warming. With a budget of EUR 76 billion, we are wide of the mark. The Commission will therefore draw up an inventory of all the existing instruments, but drafting proposals for the future financial framework will be a considerable undertaking. To optimise all our actions regarding this climate crisis, we need new resources to create a European Fund on Climate Change, which can be funded by the emission quota exchange system and which will be used to support adaptation, alleviation, sustainable consumption and energy efficiency, and therefore a large part must be devoted to the poorest countries. That requires political courage on the part of the Council, the Commission and members of this Parliament, but it is a necessary condition, essential if the planet is to take up this challenge. There will be no future for our civilisation if we, as Europeans, do not take measures to impose self-discipline in order to preserve our climate. It is a major political act, a political act which is vital to give our continent and others a stable future.... (The President cut off the speaker)

 Madam President, Commissioner, please allow me to note the Council’s absence and the innovation on the part of the French Presidency, honouring us with its absence, which is a first. I would like to say, Jutta, you had thought that it was out of contempt that the French Presidency had not met with you. I believe simply that this absence shows the contempt this Presidency has, or its Ministers have at any rate, for the budget of the European Union. I will not go back over the proposals of our rapporteurs, but I would like to dwell on just a few thoughts. I shall repeat, once again this year, that the budget is inadequate and the multiannual financial framework is unsuitable. There is a lack of funds for economic recovery policies, research, lifelong learning, networks, and aid for SMEs and micro-enterprises. It is difficult to implement the policy of territorial solidarity and, in particular, the Cohesion Fund, and therefore billions of euros are left in unused payment appropriations. Too much money is earmarked for aid for market agriculture, which leaves margins unused due to legal bases that prohibit new commitments. There are problems in using the sums set aside for rural development and the environment. Money is being scattered on security and justice policies, far removed from the Council’s public commitments, and citizenship and information policies are practically bankrupt and do not enable real communication with European citizens. However, the promises made within the framework of external action are the last straw in terms of the lack of realism. Needs are continually piling up, conflicts and poverty are taking hold all over the world – Somalia, Darfur, Asia, typhoons, cyclones, famine, war in Palestine, Kosovo, now in Georgia – and the allocated resources are not changing. Every year, mission impossible becomes ever more impossible. Only the creation of a billion-euro fund, which is essential in order to attempt to revive subsistence agriculture in the poorest countries, has provided a faint glimmer of hope. Trusting the financial perspective, we were hoping that we could continue to implement the traditional policies and find, in the margins available, enough money to respond to this different emergency, to which establishing the fight against climate change must be added. That is to overlook the fact that the budgetary agreement is negotiated with the Council and that the Council, rather I should say the 27 governments of the Member States, in addition to their traditional problems, are facing the financial crisis that is threatening the European economy, but which is being experienced as 27 national budgetary crises. That is why we are forced to adopt a budget that is not in line with Members’ expectations, a budget in which the gap between commitments and payments is giving rise to increasing concern with regard to the sincerity of the budget procedure. The desire to contribute as little as possible to the revenue of the Union leads the Member States to adopt simple and unproductive positions. Firstly, they keep payments to a bare minimum, hence the payment appropriation of less than 0.9% of GDP, with commitment promises that are never monitored, and they do not facilitate the implementation of European policies in their country so as to avoid cofinancing and thus allow unused appropriations to flow back into the coffers of each state. Admittedly, the Union’s usual policies continue to be implemented as well as can be expected. Innovative actions, which are often promoted by our pilot projects, and preparatory actions are being implemented by the Commission. The European budget, however, is characterised by promising everything and not investing sufficient funds in implementation procedures, with the willingness of each of the Member States. Once again, we have two new urgent challenges to face this year. The first is the fight against climate change, and the Council’s conclusions on the subject are modest but at least it has made some conclusions; investments need to be made this year and increased in 2010. The second challenge is the EUR 200 billion economic stimulation that has been announced. Only EUR 5 billion of that amount is needed for new investments. The financial perspective therefore needs to be reviewed somewhat. Yesterday, the President-in-Office told us that this review had been acknowledged, but the Council tells us that it has been blocked. What, then, is the situation? We in the Socialist Group in the European Parliament are ready. To conclude, we absolutely cannot continue on this course, since political Europe is falling apart before our eyes. The time has come to review the financial perspective so as to restore balance to Europe’s revenue and expenditure, to deconsecrate some immutable policies and to finance dynamic policies to effectively meet the real needs of people around the world. Lastly, I would like to wish the Commission good luck. It is up to you to implement this budget accurately without wasting a single euro. It is up to you to show sceptical states and convince them of the added value that the Union provides, both politically and in budgetary terms. (Applause)

Mr President, Commissioner, Mr President-in-Office of the Council, I should like to begin by thanking all of the rapporteurs, and especially Mrs Haug and Mr Lewandowski, as well as the entire budget team, elected representatives and administrators alike, for this traditional financial exercise for the year 2009. This is the third financial perspective, and it demonstrates just how much the annual budget procedure has become an unnatural and somewhat surreal exercise faced with the situation in Europe. It is an exercise in juggling the accounts, making it impossible to provide a genuine Community-wide solution to the problems of our society. After the Commission’s very modest draft, the Council did what it invariably does and sent us a limited proposal that does not enable any of the promises it made during the year to be fulfilled. You are right, Mr Jouyet, the European budget has been under-utilised since 1988. As in sport, regular training leads to better performances, and, as an athlete, the EU budget, by becoming smaller, becomes more inefficient and more under-used. This is the vicious circle that leads to political disasters. Admittedly, we cannot spend without calculating such expenditure, but, in view of these continued promises, it is commitment appropriations, not payment appropriations, that are being recorded. This is the beginning of budget fraud! We ought therefore to know whether the European Union wants to achieve its objectives and whether the Member States are willing or not to contribute to common policies. Faced with this impossible task, Parliament, through the work of our rapporteur, is assuming its authority. The budgetary framework is very tight, and the Commission’s lack of initiative has led the European Parliament to create new PPs and APs that will underpin future innovations. However, it is vital that, at a time when Europe is deciding to inject EUR 1 700 billion to help the euro zone’s banking sector, we manage to find EUR 250 million for the food facility for 2009. Parliament is very attached to this food aid fund. Thus, on 21 November, the ball will be in the Council’s court. Parliament has respected the authorised procedures in all their forms: respect for the Financial Perspective, the call for flexibility under the EUR 530 million ceiling and the call for an emergency aid reserve that features in the financial perspective. We are acting within the scope of our prerogatives and we therefore expect the Council to adopt a responsible political attitude that is similar to our own. This is crucial when it comes to ensuring the credibility of Europe’s work in the eyes of each and every citizen. Mr Jouyet, I appeal to you: politics is about anticipating; Parliament’s position enables us to anticipate while respecting the rules to which the three institutions have chosen to submit. Prove that you are equal to your commitments!

 Madam President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, this week, Parliament is deciding on the political priorities of the budget under difficult circumstances, both internally and externally. We are having to cope with many challenges, while the framework of the financial perspective is very limited. I therefore particularly welcome the courageous political work done by our rapporteur, Mrs Haug. She has managed to anticipate the stages of the budgetary procedure to enable us to determine where our institution is heading. This new procedure provides greater clarity, and therefore greater democracy, for citizens. It has thus been possible to understand and discuss the priorities of the parliamentary committees and political groups. Unfortunately, I must once again deplore the Council’s lack of ambition and the systematic nature of the cuts it made to the Commission’s preliminary draft budget. We note that its aim is to save money on administrative expenditure. This is not a matter of identifying a political priority but of making technical savings that often double the margin in some headings, as Mr Färm said regarding sub-heading 1a. Similarly, I cannot explain the linear cuts made in payments: EUR 1 billion less than the preliminary draft budget. As regards heading 2, matters are clear. In 2008 we left an unused margin of more than EUR 3 billion. For the 2009 budget, the Commission is proposing a margin of more than EUR 2 billion, and the Council is going further by increasing this margin to EUR 2.4 billion. However, needs are plentiful in rural development, and also in energy, immigration, climate change and international solidarity. At a time when the food sovereignty issue is becoming more pressing with every passing day, and when it looks like if we do nothing, eating will become a luxury in Europe, the Council has decided to reduce agricultural expenditure. Even if you have not touched the budget lines within our traditional priority, you have forgotten to increase all those for which you are making promises. Similarly, after the recent failure of the Irish referendum and the French and Dutch referendums two years ago, does it not seem that communicating with and informing citizens are important activities that require considerable investment? By denying this essential need to inform, communicate with and listen to citizens, we are reaping the results of this autism in each consultation and opinion poll. Finally, I will never understand the Council’s behaviour when it comes to heading 4. The observation is clear, and is always the same. This heading is dramatically underfunded, so we should not allow promises to be made that will never be kept. How can we hope to solve the problems associated with developing multilateral relations, problems of hunger in the world or the consolidation of democracy, and not propose an increase? You are even suggesting cuts for the policies that are working. There is only one thing we can do in the next few weeks: go over both the monitoring and the writing of each budget line again, but also explore all the possibilities for achieving a budgetary framework that gives the European Union a realistic, unifying budget for 2009.

Mr President, Commissioner, it is somewhat worrying that the Commission should have to be reminded of its responsibility for the fair implementation of European policies within each national territory. The fact is that the French Government has singled out the region of Auvergne and withdrawn responsibility for the management of European Social Fund resources there from Local Employment Plans. The Government’s position is incomprehensible. The bodies concerned have an excellent administrative track record and this partisan decision jeopardises structures that have been working for years to integrate the poorest people in society. The European Commission needs to remind the French Government of its duties to be consistent and to respect the rules on implementation of European funding. We cannot have agreements with the European Union being applied in a divisive, partisan manner in different parts of the same country.

 Mr President, Commissioner, here we are at last at the launch of the political priorities procedure for 2009. It is an important step because there will be many changes – a new parliamentary term, the establishment of the Treaty – and it also marks a new way of responding in Parliament to the Commission’s annual policy strategy, since we have decided that the political groups will speak rather than the Committee on Budgets. 	 The political choices of the Socialist Group in the European Parliament are clear, and they have already been stated: they are for a social Europe. They want a Europe that is in favour of making the fight against climate change a priority; they also want a Europe that favours common external action. When I see that the Commission wants the EU’s contribution to security and stability on the international scene to be increased, I wonder: Where are we going to find the money? How are we going to make this pious wish a reality? If we continue along the same path, the Council will put us in an untenable position, as it does every year: that of choosing which area of the world to sacrifice. A fourth priority for us is our citizens. What the Commission tells us is that citizens should be put first in 2009. It is high time, because our political project cannot go on being so remote from the people. We therefore need to improve all our exchanges, information and communication, but where are the funds for this? One thing is clear: budgetary resources are lacking! The margins available have already been spoken for and we in the Committee on Budgets do not know now how these priorities are going to be financed. We do not want to sacrifice the old priorities in order to implement new ones. What are you going to do? There is great urgency to lift Europe out of its budgetary and administrative muddle. The political world is changing very quickly and we in Europe are coming up with ideas, but we have never been able to adopt the resources needed to implement them pragmatically as regards the political expectations of Parliament, certainly, but also of our citizens.

 Mr President, Commissioner, Chairmen, ladies and gentlemen, the EU’s general budget reflects the serious tendencies of economies marked by current financial prospects. There will be EUR 120 billion in payment appropriations, accounting for 0.96% of the Member States’ total GNI. All this is quite modest, and a far cry from the actual needs of the political project announced by the European decision-makers in the Council, in the Commission and also here in Parliament. We have often cited the causes of this in the House: national egoisms rocking the common boat, excessive caution by the Commission when implementing our budgetary guidelines, or the EU’s general inability to come up with innovative, realistic projects. This year, once again, led by our excellent rapporteurs – including Mr Virrankoski – we had to find solutions to develop policies that we feel are essential and new pilot projects that our fellow citizens expect. This year, once again, we have witnessed the slender financial framework for the EU’s international action, which does not make it any easier for us when taking up our commitments concerning Palestine and Kosovo. This year, however, one project managed to overcome such rigidness: Galileo. I would especially like to thank Commissioner Grybauskaitė, Mr Romero, Chairman Böge and Mr Virrankoski, and all the members of the Committee on Budgets, both Members and administrators, whose firm conviction and negotiating strategy were rewarded by a financing agreement with the Council. I feel like saying: ‘Luckily the Commission and Parliament were there’, but I cannot neglect the role played by the Portuguese Presidency and Mr Santos, who got things moving with his know-how and his ability to listen. We should remember that after the negotiations it is Europe as a whole that has secured the financing of Galileo entirely through Community funds. With the European Technology Institute, the package totals EUR 2.7 billion, without jeopardising any EU policies. This example of a joint political demand is a rare item in the EP’s budgetary history. The Socialists interpret this as a sign of hope not only for the autonomy of the EU’s satellite navigation as of 2013, but also as an indication of Parliament’s ability to make use of its powers and fulfil its responsibilities in the preparation of the EU’s budgetary future.

 Mr President, Commissioner, first of all I would like to thank the whole of the budget team for the work they have done, especially our two rapporteurs, Mr Virrankoski and Mr Itälä. This budget procedure confirms the narrowness of the multiannual financial framework. The amount of payments, at less than EUR 130 billion, or 0.99% of GDP, is very skimpy and cannot support hopes for the development of European policy. The teamwork in the Committee on Budgets means that the budgetary priorities of the political groups can be maintained, but the financial framework prevents the revival of the growth policies promised to European citizens. Our committee took particular care over the choices made by all the parliamentary committees, but the proliferation of pilot projects is evidence of the frustration with the niggardly nature of this financial framework. Once again, we have had to fight drastic cuts by the Council and I am happy with the compromise secured. The Commission still needs to execute this budget correctly. We will no longer put up with this draft budget being denatured through failures to execute and transfers of appropriations back to the Member States. Firstly, in the 2008 budget, we do not accept the failure to use the cohesion funds. In the Socialist Party, we have restored the Council’s dreadful cuts that affected programmes such as Culture 2007, Media 2007 and Youth in Action. I do not need to remind you here of the importance of these lines as the new Treaty is being put to the people of Europe. I invite the Council to think about this; for example, giving research or Frontex the resources they need to operate, and improving the lines of information correspond to the current concerns of European citizens. We are also proposing additional appropriations for certain new projects to improve the capacity to accommodate refugees or for NGOs fighting discrimination. The European budget absolutely must continue to help those fighting the scourges afflicting European society. For the EU’s external relations, we are reducing the expenditure of the CFSP by 40 million because we have to honour our commitments and the EU’s commitments: to preserve the emergency aid reserve, help the most disadvantaged countries, support the Global Fund to fight AIDS, the World Health Fund and maintain development aid. For Kosovo and Palestine, the flexibility instrument will need to be mobilised to provide EUR 87 million. It is still to be deplored that heading 4 is systematically underfunded. World poverty is growing and our budget is shrinking. For the European Commission, I recognise that the reserve of EUR 40 million is harsh but it reflects our doubts over the effectiveness of implementing ABM. Allow me to give you a few examples: first of all, the failure to spend the cohesion funds, the impossibility of executing the pilot projects we hold dear, such as the Erasmus-style programme for apprentices, the lack of transparency in the choices of research firms, the poor implementation of selection competitions for new officials. The list is long and Parliament is asking to be convinced of the goodwill of the European executive. Finally, the main one, the asterisk amendment demands that Galileo and the EIT are funded beyond the ceilings of the financial perspective. This necessitates, forces even, a mini-revision of the financial perspective. Parliament cannot accept the endangering of Galileo, a major challenge from a technological, economic and political point of view, and an essential strategic tool for the political powers and independence of the EU, but I am convinced of the value of Mrs Merkel’s comments in our chamber. On 29 June, Chancellor Merkel used this African proverb to close her Presidency: ‘If you want to go quickly, go alone, but if you want to go far, go together.’

 Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, I should like firstly to congratulate our rapporteur on his work and on the content of his report on the annual strategic priorities. This report is the start of our budgetary procedure, and we share the bulk of the concerns and, often, the priorities, expressed therein. I am going to dwell on two specific points. This year, like every year, Parliament is outlining the priorities that it would like the European Commission to execute. Among the objectives that Parliament plans to assign to the budgetary procedure this year is the idea of a budget focused on results, which in our view means clear objectives to enable these priorities to be executed meticulously. I subscribe to this idea. It is important that we show our desire for the Union’s expenditure programmes to help achieve the political objectives that they are supposed to achieve, and this for several reasons: the achievement of these political objectives is crucial in terms of making the Union appear legitimate in the eyes of the citizens; we must support the Commission’s plan to develop the ‘Better Lawmaking’ principle in its new initiatives and working methods; and lastly, I am firmly convinced that an effective administrative system for the Union must be provided with the necessary resources. I must, however, express some doubts about the way in which the results of this exercise are used, and here I am addressing the Council, which is sadly absent. I agree that more attention should be paid to the objectives and to assessing the results of the policies carried out. I also believe that this assessment must go beyond the stage of simply providing information on the administrative process as it was previously, when part of the PDB. Nevertheless, my group will strongly oppose the possibility of this assessment being used to underpin budget cuts in administrative decisions or human resources. Personal accountability for the Union’s operations is an important element of the activity-based budget approach. However, if this accountability is to be transformed into initiative, the European Commission must be given the resources to act. Finally, I should like to remind you of the importance that my group attaches to communication problems. It should be remembered that the key aspect of the communication and information policy is to inform every EU citizen about the work of the institutions. I therefore endorse the Commission proposal, which aims at launching campaigns on the Union’s political priorities. These campaigns will be able to be launched as soon as Parliament has voted on these priorities. Nevertheless, we expect many things to come out of the hearing organised by the Committee on Budgets. Its conclusions must underpin the drafting of a new communication policy. Democracy is a difficult exercise, and information is one pillar of it.

Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, the own-initiative report that we are debating today relates to an area that is crucially important for the future of the Union – that of its resources. When we talk about the Union’s resources, we are talking about its means of subsistence, but above all, we are talking about its means of undertaking tasks and of producing public policies. We are talking about the continuation of the European idea and of the innovative policies that Europe alone makes it possible for us to carry out. The aim of the Socialist Group in the European Parliament is to achieve these two ambitious objectives: the continuation of the European project and political and economic innovation. The crucial thing, for Parliament, is to show the Member States that the Europe of projects, the Europe of sharing and of solidarity, is possible. This means that we cannot insist on our national advantages. It means adopting a responsible parliamentary proposal in the hope that the Council will move in the direction of a transparent, fair and effective system. The fact is, the Union’s resources, at present, really need to be simplified. This complex system has become incomprehensible to the citizens and the European decision-makers. It is an unfair and inappropriate system. Our work, done in cooperation with the national parliaments, has convinced us that the introduction of a new budget for resources will take a long time and that it will have to take place in two stages. Currently, Community budgetary negotiations are just about a clash of national egos. An erroneous principle is being established here: the principle of fair return, which dismantles European solidarity and goes against our project. It is the poison of the European Community. The very notion of net balance should be destroyed. Thanks to the rapporteur and to the amendments tabled by the Committee on Budgets, the text stresses the importance of abolishing, once and for all, all forms of compensation and of rebate mechanism. It is therefore logical to temporarily abolish the VAT resource, because, in its current form, it legitimises all cases in which a rebate is paid. We also confirm the options in the Böge report on the financial perspective. It is vital to link this reform of revenue to the reform of expenditure. In this context, cofinancing of the CAP may be considered, but without renationalisation. We must first denounce the unfair system so that we can subsequently provide Europe with resources that are built on sound and fair foundations. Only then, when that is done, is Mr Lamassoure proposing to create a tax that could take various forms while preserving the Member States’ fiscal sovereignty. We support the idea of a consolidated tax, for example, corporation tax or environmental tax, as Jacques Delors was proposing as far back as 1991, or a tax on financial transactions, a tax on currency transactions. In this report, we are not limiting the boundaries of what is possible. We are preparing for the second phase of our work. We are therefore acknowledging a nonsense system so that we can have done with it. With the exception of customs duties and certain agricultural taxes, the other receipts are not own resources. To conclude, providing the Union with real resources means increasing Europe’s resource autonomy so that it is no longer subject to the blocking power of a given Member State. It also means making the budget consistent again. Whoever decides on expenditure must be responsible for revenue before the public. Finally, it means getting away from the idea of accounting returns which, for years, has been undermining all of our European projects and destroying the very idea of solidarity, on which Europe – the 50th anniversary of which we are celebrating – is based.

Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, I should like to thank the Commission for this document, which is timely, coming as it does at the start of our budget procedure. It is consistent with our priorities, which are the Lisbon Strategy, the fight against climate change and its effects, judicial cooperation and so on, but it overlooks the importance of the social dimension and of social cohesion in the future of the Union. Your priorities are needed to enable the Union to rise to the challenges of globalisation. Nevertheless, I question the fact that neither the financial perspective nor the programmes as they have been codecided leave us with much room for manoeuvre. To be more precise, with regard to competitiveness, growth and employment, if the margin is left unchanged – at EUR 70 million – if new priorities are announced regarding Frontex and Eurojust and if three new transport agencies are created, then certain policies are liable to suffer: I am thinking of the seventh FRDP, which could have difficulties in getting off the ground; I am thinking of the trans-European transport network, funding for which is absolutely crucial; I am thinking of all those social policies that are not yet sufficiently developed; and I am thinking of the CIP, which is a vital tool of the Lisbon Strategy. We ought not to reduce the commitments of these already badly-managed policies. It is not only European growth that is at stake here, but also our objectives regarding competitiveness, employment and solidarity. As regards the freedom, security and justice policies, the margin of EUR 32 million is very small. Increasing the funding for policies arising out of Frontex and Eurojust will inevitably reduce the resources originally allocated to other vital programmes, such as the integration of third-country nationals and such as a truly ambitious policy aimed at refugees, the protection of fundamental rights. The European Commission is implying that these programmes are not yet up to speed. Why, though, were they not implemented quicker? With regard to agricultural issues, I join my colleagues from the Committee on Agriculture and Rural Development in expressing serious doubts about the proposal for a single CMO covering all agricultural sectors. This could result in a lack of consideration being given to the specific characteristics of some agricultural produce. Given that the scope of the ‘health check’ exercise is not yet known or detailed in the Commission proposals, I would ask you to provide some clarification on this matter. The recent statements made by the Commissioner for Agriculture contradict what you wrote. As for the Union’s actions, we are anxious to see all of the declared priorities upheld. We cannot accept our priorities regarding health, education and promotion being neglected in favour of energy. Finally, I am surprised at how brief were the allusions made to the revision exercise scheduled to begin in 2008. This leads me to address the Commission directly: is the revision of the financial perspective a taboo subject? I have already expressed my curiosity to know the estimated additional cost of the better regulation initiative. Could you provide us with the estimates for which we have been waiting for so long? Finally, I should like to see the spotlight put on communication this year. It is mentioned in this text, but the Commission’s actions need to be refocused on this matter. The Europe of democracy is at a standstill, the citizens are turning their backs on it and our texts are more and more ambitious. We are far from achieving our dreams.

Mr President, Mrs Grybauskaitė, Mrs Wideroos, ladies and gentlemen, firstly, I should like to say a big thank you to all of those involved in this budgetary procedure and, in particular, to our rapporteurs, Mr Grech and Mr Elles, without forgetting Mrs Gräßle and Mr Pittella, and our secretariats. Thanks to them, we have been able to establish a budget that fully respects Parliament's budgetary powers. This draft budget on the financial perspective is particularly sensitive. We have taken account of the time needed to launch the new programmes, while prioritising what are crucial actions for the Socialist Group in the European Parliament: policies on research, transport, innovation, social Europe, an environmental and knowledge-based Europe – in short, a People’s Europe. The budgetary instrument of the European Globalisation Adjustment Fund puts in place a new instrument of European solidarity. As regards external affairs, we are following the guidelines of the specialised committees, which respect the balance between the thematic approach and the geographical approach. We hoped, thanks to the new financial perspective, to succeed in establishing better interinstitutional relations, and I will not hide from you my disappointment on this matter. Even our relations with the Council are deteriorating. Firstly, Mrs Wideroos, you have just reassured us about the commitments made by the Council regarding the conciliation procedure: indeed, we value this agreement on the financial regulation. However, you have often lost sight of Parliament’s powers, and we have often had the impression that our rights were not being respected. Moreover, we take a very dim view of the contempt with which the new Member States are treated; you intended to deprive them of resources in terms of recruitment and structural policies. We have therefore faced difficulties, before coming up with an appropriate programme for 2007. Commissioner, Parliament puts all of the resources that you requested at your disposal: reasonable commitment appropriations, a low level of payments – 0.99% of GNI – which you nonetheless regard as sufficient, and, above all, very few reserves. In return, we will watch over matters very closely to ensure that our vote is not distorted during implementation. Let me be clear: the global transfer votes or the SABs, which are as important now as they were in the past, are excluded. We will not stand in the way of the Commission’s exercising its prerogatives. Instead, we should reconsider whether the resources, in terms of staff, are adequate for the implementation of the policies we are seeking to promote. In future, if we reduce the budget too much, we will no longer be able to develop any of these policies that the citizens expect. Disrupted, as it is, in its project, the Union is a seriously ailing body, and we are providing it with a particularly modest budget for 2007! For the forthcoming budgets, we need to adopt a constructive approach, which looks to the future, and no longer a defensive stance, aimed at containing national self-interest. For Parliament, for the Socialists, the European project consists of genuine, financial solidarity, which the Council sadly overlooks on a daily basis.

Madam President, I should simply like to say that we deplore the organisation of the debate on second reading in its current form. Indeed, every time, the Committee on Budgets does a huge amount of work, and we find ourselves penalised by the time allotted to us to present our work and to explain the way in which we have worked and the outcome we have achieved. It would have been extremely interesting to have seen other Members take part in this debate and to have heard the Commissioner's and, perhaps, the Council's, response. All too often, we are overlooked when it comes to organising plenary sessions. We note, once again, that more than ten minutes remain, which several of our fellow Members could have used in order to outline the work they have done this year.
 Catherine Guy-Quint (PSE

 The legislative programme before us today is just a quiet renewal of the programmes for previous years. Even so, I find it quite remarkable that the Commission has not said a single word on two major reforms on which it is currently working, namely the review of the financial perspective and the mid-term review of the common agricultural policy. These are politically very difficult issues, but we cannot just ignore them. The fact that the constitutional, budgetary and agricultural debates are all taking place in 2007 means that the institutions really need to prepare themselves. With regard to the reduction in administrative costs set out by the Commission, the vision of European policy that underlies it is, in general, very simplistic and penny-pinching – it is a short-term vision from which our political priorities will suffer. Instead, we should reconsider whether the resources, particularly in terms of staff, provided to the Commission are adequate for the implementation of the policies we are seeking to promote. True, the solutions proposed by the Commission in its citizens' agenda are based on the idea of a proactive political programme targeted at the needs and expectations of Europeans. Unfortunately, though, I cannot now find in this document any specific or new proposals for how to achieve the objectives of this programme. The same is true of the Lisbon Strategy, which we are told has been relaunched. I cannot share your optimism. Finally, let us not forget that, every year, the overall budget allocated in fact contradicts the document that you are presenting to us today and distorts the political will demonstrated and voted on by our Parliament. Does this document today not ultimately come down to words and pious hopes?

 Mr President, I would take the liberty of speaking once again on the subject of the Bulgarian nurses and the Palestinian doctor. They are still in Tripoli, in the prisons of the Libyan State. You know, as I do, that they are imprisoned under false accusations. The review of their trial was supposed to conclude at the end of October. However, in October, the court again postponed its decision, this time until 19 December. The court says that it is beginning to take into consideration the opinion of international experts, who tirelessly bring evidence of the innocence of the accused. Mr President, could we not demonstrate again the great interest that we take in the fate of these prisoners who have been tortured and have been absent from their homes for eight years for having treated young Libyans? This situation cannot be tolerated, as, month after month, they are promised a trial. This new trial, the third, is inequitable and unjust and leaves them in the throes of a death sentence.

 Mr President, Mrs Wideroos, Mrs Grybauskaitė, ladies and gentlemen, allow me first of all to thank our two rapporteurs, Mr Elles and Mr Grech, who, through the work they have done and the tenacity they have shown, have been able to give direction to our work on this first reading of the budget. This budget, the first of the 2007-2013 programme, is a very modest one, representing only 1.04% of GDP. Not only is it very modest, but it is probably not up to the challenges facing the European Union: the energy crisis, the crisis of confidence, world conflicts and the increase in poverty and job insecurity, all coming at a time when Europeans are expressing ever more expectations of the European Union. The restricted framework forces very modest ambitions on us. Quality, and not just quantity, characterises the approach to this 2007 budget, therefore. The budget has also compelled us to adopt a hybrid strategy. Indeed, not only are our legal bases for the new policies not ready, but we are not ready, either, to champion and implement all the policies wished for by Europeans. We want to be ambitious, as people expect us to be, but we must also be realistic, as we do not know whether we shall be able to implement these policies. For the Socialist Group in the European Parliament, the minimum consisted in reinstating the preliminary draft budget for all the policies to which we are attached and, in particular, for the Lisbon objectives and the Gothenburg policies, not forgetting employment, solidarity, the environment and rural development. 2007 should be the year in which our communication policy is overhauled, given that Europeans have been very much forgotten up until now. Where external policy is concerned, I would also appeal for us to adopt a balanced approach to administration, particularly where the EU’s borders are concerned, as we cannot be satisfied with a unilateral approach that concentrates on law and order. I should like, if I may, to emphasise two important points: first of all, the role to be played under the heading of the EU budget by cofinancing involving the European Investment Bank, and this with a view to relaunching the Lisbon and Gothenburg strategies; and, secondly, the role of pilot projects and preparatory actions, which have always favoured the birth of new ideas and which should be implemented. In reality, I am mostly concerned about the implementation of this budget. Our rapporteur has opted for spending with a qualitative focus. This amounts to championing the way in which our priorities have traditionally been financed, but it also constitutes an appeal to the Commission to respect fully the political choices made by Parliament. If, moreover, Parliament can make criticisms of the way in which policies are administered by the other institutions, it is because such criticism is authorised by the Treaty, the institutional agreements and actual practice. Parliament is one of the branches of the budgetary authority, and we do not wish to be dispossessed of our power as a result of abandoning all authority regarding the way in which our votes are brought into play. Is it fair, however, for us, in the name of that power, to make it more difficult for these same institutions to exercise their prerogatives? No. It would be dangerous, and even counter-productive, to try to intervene too much in administrative practice. I would also say to the Council that the Commission could not do better if, at the same time, we were to agree to freeze recruitment by that institution. However, we have little room for manoeuvre if – as we have cause to fear, given the latest line proposed - all our priorities are adjusted in accordance with the European Commission’s shortcomings in implementing policy. Finally, and in conclusion, I wanted to tell you, Mr President, that the Council must remember that it cannot impose its point of view, because we need together to comply with the priorities of the European political project and because, if we reduce the budget by too much, we shall no longer be able to develop any of these policies of which Europeans expect so much.

 Mr President, the trial of the Palestinian doctor and Bulgarian nurses in Libya reopened three weeks ago. The procedure chosen is a very complicated one and will make it very difficult for international organisations to help defend the rights of these persons who have been wrongly imprisoned. In fact, the procedure involves only one hearing a week. You can see how difficult it is going to be to organise their defence. Moreover, everyone knows that, materially speaking, the crimes of which they are accused are implausible and that these citizens have been held in prison and tortured for seven years. May we therefore join together in saying to Libya that our only concern, now and in the future, is to help young Libyans who are infected with Aids. In no case, however, do we want Libya to take citizens hostage, be they from Europe or anywhere else in the world. We must say to the authorities, in the name of human rights, in the name of respect for Libya, ‘release them!’ (Applause from the left)

 Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, as President Lewandowski said, we have been aware since this morning of the definitive framework for the European budgets for the next seven years. Since this morning, we have, then, been aware of Parliament’s need to remain modest, and even humble, with regard to the proposals it may allow itself to put forward. Even if this framework is in itself new, there will also, I hope, be another new feature, namely that this will be a budget for 27 Member States. As coordinator for the Socialist Group in the European Parliament, I am keen to champion respect for the commitments we have made to Europeans. With regard to our priorities, these will remain, in the first place, the internal policies that are to support the Lisbon Objectives, not forgetting the environment and rural development. Only in this way will a balanced approach to territorial planning be guaranteed. The promotion of sustainable growth and job creation in the EU implies not only that the Member States will properly implement legislation, both that in force and that proposed, but also that we will propose more ambitious objectives in these areas. 2007 will also have to be the year in which our policy for communicating with our citizens is overhauled. In the same way, I would urge a balanced approach to administering the EU’s external borders, as we cannot be content with a unilateral, security-based approach. Policies linked to immigration must be counterbalanced by the integration of third-country nationals and by solidarity in administering borders. Let us not forget that security is also about protecting individual freedoms. We therefore need to develop policies in favour of refugees. Where external policy is concerned, our watchwords are not only development, democratisation and human rights but also respect for the Millennium Goals, which constitute an absolute priority. The EU must provide itself with the appropriate tools to enable it to make its presence felt on the international stage. Finally, I would take the liberty of coming out in favour of co-funding by the European Investment Bank of programmes crucial to giving practical expression to the Lisbon and Gothenburg Strategies. These would be constructive arrangements. I wish, however, to point out the need to guarantee public funding on a scale large enough to create the leverage conditions expected by the EIB. Loan guarantees and other such measures are in no position to replace the new money that only the EU can guarantee. I should like to tell you, Commissioner, that I read with great interest that the Commission was banking on an acceleration of European growth in 2006. This means high growth, since a 2.6% increase is anticipated. Your communiqués state that Europe would be in a position to create 3.6 million jobs. Apart from the fact that these forecasts remain less than completely reliable, particularly in view of the fluctuation that is a predominant feature of the oil markets, do you think that this growth is sufficient to provide Europe with the financial resources necessary to its development? To conclude, I wish Mr Elles good luck. He must, in turn, try to inject some ambition into this budget. I think, however, that, with such a rigid and narrow budgetary framework, it will be difficult for him to find the resources for the ambitious policy expected by Europeans.

Mr President, I should like straight away to thank the Commissioner for this new report, which is a very rigorous piece of administrative work on the part of the Commission. However, this very rigour is leading the Commission again to postpone its decision on Bulgaria’s and Romania’s accession date. In spite of the dynamism shown by these countries and although all the signs still point towards accession, the report expresses serious reservations. Once again, you recommend them to continue with their efforts in a wide variety of areas: agricultural administration, the monitoring of Community expenditure and the fight against crime, corruption and fraud. Moreover, those who have spoken in this House have added to this list: the integration of minorities, international adoption and the control of customs contraband. In my opinion, it does need to be acknowledged that Bulgaria and Romania are not alone in having these types of problem. Current events in Europe demonstrate every day how Europe falls short in all these areas. Why then, Mr Rehn, should new demands constantly be added to the accession criteria? Why postpone a decision that gave rise to fewer difficulties for the ten countries that acceded last time round? With this decision in view, you are being extremely cautious, and this will have an impact on Bulgarians’ and Romanians’ hopes as they anticipate the outcome of the decision. For a year now, we have been aware of the consequences of nations’ despair as they contemplate Europe’s future. With each consecutive report, the Commission multiplies the demands associated with the accession criteria to be fulfilled, then backs off when faced with having to take a decision. With each consecutive report, the Bulgarian and Romanian nations feel humiliated, despite the fact that they are making progress. The people of those countries have ever more doubts about their right to occupy a place in our European democracy. With each report that is published, populism gains ground. The moment has therefore come to take a clear and courageous decision about Bulgaria’s and Romania’s date of entry into the EU. In our opinion, this should be 1 January 2007, for these two countries are essential to a genuine European Union project.

Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, I should like to begin by paying tribute to the work of both the rapporteur, Mrs Gräßle, and the draftsman, Mr Pahor, and by congratulating them on the quality of their report. As MEPs, we had a duty, in fact, to review the financial regulation, and this for several reasons. It was becoming urgent to reform it. To prove this, I only need mention the various problems that we have had to tackle as representatives of the people of Europe, especially where providing Europeans with information was concerned. We need to be better at communicating with people and to communicate with them more often. Reviewing the financial regulation is one way of doing this. The lump-sum payments with regard to procurement procedures and to the award of grants are to be welcomed as a step in the direction of better financial management. The same goes, moreover, for the protection of the Communities’ financial interests, to be achieved, inter alia, 
by the amendment tabled in relation to the recovery, suspension and implementation of contracts and penalties. I am thinking, in particular, of the amendments concerning the simplification measures. The challenge for us is to strike a balance between simplification and sound financial management. I welcome the approach of the rapporteur and the draftsman, aimed at making the rules simpler for the beneficiaries, thanks in particular to the simplification of administrative procedures and the simultaneous tightening of controls on the way in which our budget is spent. We must provide the resources for an ongoing dialogue with civil society and not discriminate between organisations – between those that have the resources to respond to Community programmes and those that do not. The report will in fact make it possible to safeguard Parliament’s rights in the future, whether in terms of its power of control or of its right to information in its capacity as a branch of the budgetary authority. Similarly, I should like to point out that the provisions concerning the funding of political groups or political parties are of the utmost importance. We are concerned here, in actual fact, with the formation of European citizenship, a citizenship to which Parliament must contribute in order to ensure the development of the European public space.

Mr President, I must inform you that, for several years, the company L.G. Philips has been axing jobs not only in the constituency of Dreux, but also in Aix-la-Chapelle, the Netherlands and Hungary. All this is nothing new. However, one should also be aware that, in 2001, this company was created to prevent the problems affecting the cathode-ray screen market from putting the holding company, Philips, at a disadvantage. Behaviour such as this is extremely serious because it allows our large companies to shirk their economic, social and industrial responsibilities. Promises were made to the workers employed by these three factories but, to date, these promises have come to nothing. Furthermore, this liquidation reminds us of the events that took place in the Isère region with regard to HP and also reminds us that the large groups are doing as they please and are gradually dismantling Europe’s industrial policy.

Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, I should like today to thank all those who participated in our work, beginning with our general rapporteurs, Mr Pittella and Mr Dombrovskis, before moving on to Mr Böge and Mr Garriga and to the entire Committee on Budgets led by Mr Lewandowski. I also do not wish to leave out our administrators and assistants. In actual fact, we have ended up today with a smaller budget than we were hoping for, but one that has been drawn up quite legally and that adheres to the current financial perspective, namely 1.09% of commitment appropriations. That is important and exceeds the results obtained last year. Furthermore, we can use the flexibility instrument to adhere to the promises made by the Council. We will remember, though, the problems we had in securing this option when we embark upon the forthcoming negotiations. What is more, all the margins have been adhered to. In short, we have attained a modest and reasonable budget, which will do no damage to the revenue provided by the Member States. The budget adheres to the priorities we set and, thanks to several policies adopted under codecision, it mainly enables us to anticipate the Lisbon Strategy and to hold on to the bulk of external aid, the aid that we give to the poorest countries and that we value highly. I should like, however, to return to a number of points close to our hearts, which relate to the implementation of the budget. Today, the budget that we are presenting has a political dimension to it. It is up to the Commission, however, to make sure that this political dimension is maintained when the budget is implemented. Clearly, we must avoid having any surpluses next year. In fact, if the budget headings continue not to be implemented, then the European Parliament’s political commitment, as budgetary authority, is likely to dwindle. Commissioner, we no longer want to see returns of EUR 2 billion on whichever Fund it may be. Everything must be implemented; we have given you the resources for this. If you encounter difficulties, let us know in due time. Finally, I should like to say to the Council that, admittedly, we now have a proper budget for 2006, agreed upon in the wake of a whole host of problems. We are in this situation because the promises made by the Council are not often backed up with funds and because you had made a commitment, more than two years ago, to implement an information system on security policy. We are one of the two branches of budgetary authority, and we consider it disgraceful that the European institutions, and the Council in particular, seem to be unaware of this fact. The Committee on Budgets approved of the Council’s wisdom in seeking to make strong political decisions for this 2006 budget. We will harbour the same concerns where the forthcoming financial perspective is concerned. Today, we have the only legal proposal: the vote on 8 June, widely adopted by our Parliament. Since then, we have been awaiting a genuine proposal from the Council. When this reaches us, we will be ready – ready to work and to negotiate, in view of our shared years of experience. The Committee on Budgets will work for a budget benefiting Europeans. It will adopt a similar approach in the negotiations on the financial perspective, and Parliament will support it with a view to providing the European Union with a budgetary framework that will enable it to fund the activities in which it is required to engage with a view to developing quality jobs and protecting the environment. We want this to be done in the context of real solidarity not only among the nations of Europe, but also with the poorest people. As regards the 2006 budget, Parliament rejects the intergovernmental approach in relation to the financial perspective. Our Parliament wants to represent Europeans. It wants us to be united in diversity.

Mr President, I simply wished to point out that, four weeks ago, we spoke in this House about the Bulgarian nurses and the Palestinian doctor imprisoned in Libya. Since then, the judgment they were awaiting has been pushed back to 31 January. Since then, we have learned that, in 2005, as part of the fight against AIDS, the European Union sent more than EUR 1 million for the children who had been contaminated in Benghazi Hospital. Since then, we have learned that Libya is awaiting even more money before it makes a gesture. Since then, no authorisation has been given to go and visit these women and this man in prison in Libya. Since then – and this is my final point – four weeks have gone by in the lives of this man and these women who have been accused and tortured and who, for seven years, have been waiting to be treated fairly, in accordance with their human rights. Mr President, for as long as they remain imprisoned, we must go on pointing this out.
 Catherine Guy-Quint (PSE

(FR) 
Mr President, thank you very much for the speaking time I have been given, but are you aware that, since 1999, five Bulgarian nurses and a Palestinian doctor have been held in prison in Libya? They were sentenced to death in 2004 because 400 Libyan children and teenagers had been contaminated by the AIDS virus in Benghazi Hospital. Everyone knows that neither the Bulgarian nurses nor the Palestinian doctor were responsible for this contamination but, in spite of everything, they were taken hostage and since May 2004, have been sentenced to death. They will learn tomorrow whether or not their appeals have been accepted. We have often brought up this issue within the European Parliament but we really need to participate in any possible moves to free these people, who are victims of a policy that is completely beyond their and our understanding, in the same way that we need to try to help the Libyan children who have been contaminated.

Mr President, what I am about to do is not standard practice. In the following heading, we have two amendments: one amendment tabled by the Committee on Budgets and another concerning orphan medicinal products, which was tabled by the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Food Safety. We have to vote in favour of the amendment tabled by the Committee on Budgets. As far as the second amendment is concerned, it is calling for an additional EUR 1 million for orphan medicinal products, which the European Agency for the Evaluation of Medicinal Products requires. I should like to know if it would be possible for us to vote on Amendment 231, so that the Agency might be able to work this year with all of the resources it requires. You will realise that, technically speaking, this is not correct procedure. I entirely agree. However, it turns out that, since the vote in the Committee on Budgets, we have received additional details. If it were possible to vote in favour of Amendment 231, which would add EUR 1 million still available in the budget margin, this would enable us substantially to improve working conditions in such a very important area to us. (Applause)
 Catherine Guy-Quint (PSE

(FR) 
Mr President, we can also vote in favour of Amendment 779. However, I should like it if, in addition to Amendment 779, we were able to vote in favour of granting a further EUR 1 million to the European Agency for the Evaluation of Medicinal Products for orphan medicinal products. I should like to point out to you that, if anyone objects to this, we are obliged to accept his or her objection.

Mr President, Commissioner, on behalf of the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs, I should like to outline our budgetary priorities. Firstly, we need appropriate resources to ensure high quality and coherent economic analyses enabling accurate economic prospects to be established for the Union. You know that we are committed to the PRINCE Programme ‘The euro, a currency for Europe’ because, as we also know, a second wave of euros is due to be introduced and we therefore need to continue to keep citizens in all of our countries interested in the currency. Finally, we are very keen to help SMEs by promoting both a viable economic environment for microenterprises and ethical financing instruments. As for giving support to the Fiscalis Programme, which is aimed at improving the functioning of the indirect taxation systems of the internal market, we are training the officials required in each country because, as far as we are concerned, doing so will guarantee that the Union has a future and is secure and prosperous.

Mr President, Commissioner, allow me to make an introductory remark. It seems to me that we ought to change these procedures relating to a so-called budgetary debate, because it is absurd to restrict each committee to one minute’s speaking time. A new procedure really ought to be drawn up. (Applause)
 I should like to say to you that our rapporteurs and all of the members of the Committee on Budgets have adopted a strategic approach with regard to this budget. On the one hand, the EU has needs, and it has a very large number of them: traditional policies, agricultural policy, Structural Fund policy. These needs are extensive and they certainly cost a lot of money. However, we must not forget that the EU has an ever increasing number of new needs: in terms of employment, sustainable development and everything the Lisbon Strategy entails for research, networks, information for citizens, training and security in every sense of the word, whether security against terrorism, border security or security, for example, in the current context of avian influenza. On the other hand, the EU also has duties to fulfil, as regards, for example, helping the poorest people and those countries awaiting membership of the European Union, not to mention helping other countries in which the death toll is constantly rising in terms of victims of natural disasters, be they the tsunami, typhoons or the earthquake in Pakistan, of countries and regions that have been caught up in conflict – the Balkans, Afghanistan, Iraq, Gaza – and of the sugar reform. The burden on Europe’s budget is constantly increasing at exactly the same time that we are facing a shortage in revenue. We are faced with an impossible and, therefore, absurd task. This situation cannot continue. Hence our budgetary strategy, which was to allocate substantial, but by no means excessive, amounts of expenditure. However, we have not even been able to allocate all of this expenditure. We are therefore coming up against some great difficulties. I am, however, obliged to recognise that our relationship with the Commission is improving: that is why it seems to me that, this year, we have made further progress in our method of working, precisely in order to execute the budget more effectively. This improved situation will have to continue. As regards the pilot projects, we need to strengthen our action, including our preparatory actions. Our action will have to focus not only on the pilot projects we hold most dear, but on all the other pilot projects: for example, relating to SMEs, to youth assistance – particularly as part of the Erasmus programme – and to aid for the poorest countries to promote vaccinations throughout the world. My final point is that, above all, we must continue to disseminate more information around us. However, the problem is that, despite a very reasonable budget, which requires EUR 115 billion in payment appropriations – a figure corresponding to 1.04% of our GDP – we will find ourselves confronted with an imperturbable and stoic Council, which has only one thing to say: hands off my national budgets! I call on the Council to cooperate more effectively with us. We are aware that there are some internal difficulties, but you also need to know that Europe will not be able to move forwards without genuine new resources. In the context of our budget, we have used nothing more than what we were entitled to within the current financial perspectives, which enable us to call for a large degree of flexibility. That is what we have done because, if we truly want to have a common future, this requirement for flexibility is crucial so that we can carry out the minimum policies sought by the European Union. Finally, we want you to understand that Parliament cannot continue doing the impossible: doing more with less.

Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, I should like to begin by telling you how pleased I am to be able to speak here in our Chamber in front of the Romanian and Bulgarian observers. It is truly a first important stage towards Romania’s and Bulgaria’s accession to the EU. I should also like to testify to the progress that I, as a member of our Parliamentary delegation, have observed take place in Bulgaria in the space of six years. A great deal of progress has been made, including progress shared by a large part of the people. However, achieving such progress has been very difficult for the people of Bulgaria because a great deal of effort was required of them. I believe that, in the West, we cannot appreciate the culture shock represented by a shift from a centrally-planned Communist economy to a market economy. You have all noted that a large number of European acquis 
have been adopted, an action that has resulted in obvious progress being made in economic and political terms. Yet, you have also highlighted a large number of grey areas. Like you, I have to admit that the integration of minorities is a very difficult problem in these countries. I am thinking about the Roma community, disabled people, women and their role, and homosexuals. However, are we in a position to tell anyone what to do when we are encountering similar problems in our own countries? Bulgaria has problems with corruption, property rights and security. In order to overcome these problems, it needs to carry out a real reform of its judicial system and to start to implement this system effectively, which will give democratic guarantees to the entire population. There is a need for Bulgaria and Romania to step up their efforts before the next progress report, and for them to do so in the space of a few months. Yet, there is also a need for the EU not to waver in continuing to contribute its help, its technical assistance and its budgetary support. Finally, I should like to say that, while we must be rigorous and demanding in our dealings with these two new countries, we must also realise that their arrival in the EU will add a new dimension to Europe and that, at last, we will together be able to turn the page on Yalta.

Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, first of all, I simply wanted to say to you that I find this impromptu meeting, which is unusual in the budget procedure, to be peculiar. In my opinion, it makes little sense. On behalf of the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs, I also wanted to express our disappointment faced with the sombre cuts made to programmes that Parliament feels very strongly about, such as PRINCE concerning information for European citizens, and in particular faced with the cuts that have been made in headings promoting new resources for SMEs. Finally, in order to have a worthwhile European policy, human resources must first be given to the committee. That is what is missing in the draft budget proposed to us and, on behalf of my committee, I wish to inform you of our utter disappointment.

Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, I am here today to talk about the amending budget for which we have been waiting for so long. It relates to the activities that we committed to financing in order to support the reconstruction of the countries affected so seriously by the tsunami in December 2004. Like you, I deplore the Council’s attitude. The budgetary authority has taken all this time to release the promised funds. In January, or even back in December, the EU promised EUR 350 million. Nine months later, we are only just going to manage to donate EUR 170 million over 2005. On 27 April, the Commission proposed a preliminary draft budget and called for the necessary mobilisation of the flexibility instrument to a level of EUR 98 million. The Council, however, would not hear of this mobilisation. You know, it is a terrible thing, this Council’s slogan is ‘Hands off my money!’ It is terrible that we have a budgetary authority that takes on responsibilities and commitments, but refuses to see them through. We have therefore had to negotiate bitterly in Parliament over the last few months in a struggle to extract EUR 15 million from the flexibility fund. That is why we have had to reallocate EUR 60 million from other humanitarian actions in order to reach a balance and to find the EUR 170 million. I have to tell you that we consider this to be a scandal, because no poor country has become richer; quite the opposite, poverty is spreading in all these countries. There is still EUR 70 million in the emergency reserve; let us hope that we will not need it at the end of the year. Of course, we support this agreement because it is urgently needed by the populations and citizens affected by the tsunami. But what a mockery! Gentlemen of the Council, I would ask two things of you: first of all, do not make any more promises, because you are never able to keep them. Secondly, I must tell you that you have notified us, but what good is the Council’s commitment with regard to the financial perspectives? I now turn to Mr Böge to say: let us take account of this event, of this problem, when negotiating the next financial perspectives. Even where the Council has taken note of it, it does not keep its word or its commitments. Yes, the European Union really is sick. The citizens have noticed it, but in general the fault is with the Member States, who have forgotten that we need to build the European Union together, for the citizens of Europe, but also for the position and the generosity of Europe, because we have a duty towards all the countries of the world, and more particularly towards the people affected by the tsunami.

 Commissioner, Mr Barroso, Mr Juncker, first of all, it is my turn to thank the Luxembourg Presidency for its efforts and, above all, for its method, which was respectful of the institutions and very democratic. I think that, in the years to come, whenever the situation becomes difficult, we will refer to this method. Having said that, it is with real bitterness that I now address you following this summit and its result regarding, in particular, the financial perspectives. Far be it from me to be provocative, but I am personally embarrassed and even ashamed at the image of national egotism presented by some European states. Overly attached to their historical advantages, they have been taught a valuable lesson in Europe by the new countries. Once again, the Council has illustrated a political adage from Corrèze: promises only bind those who believe in them. The citizens, though, are starting to no longer believe. Gentlemen of the Council –
 in passing, I would point out that there were very few women there and I think that parity within the Council would bring progress in the political habits of that institution –
 so, gentlemen of the Council, what has become of your commitments to boost growth and innovation so that everybody can find a good job, a place in our society? Keeping your word is doubtless an antiquated, outmoded virtue, but, at the foot of the budgetary wall, the Council’s word disappeared into thin air. What we were afraid of in Parliament, therefore, happened in the Council. The resolution that we broadly adopted, though, was very moderate in view of our projects and, over seven years, enabled certain policies to be developed realistically. That is my only satisfaction as an MEP and as a European citizen. We in Parliament are prepared to continue negotiations with the European Council as soon as it has its feet back on the ground, but above all when it has resumed the progression of a true political project. Each country still needs to be convinced that the added value that we gain as 25 Member States is much greater than our contributions to the European budget. Our European utopia does exist, but it needs a broader, more generous, more ambitious, more humanist vision with greater solidarity, shared by the citizens and respected by the Council, so that, together, we can confront reality and future challenges.

Mr President, first of all, may I, in turn, thank Reimer Böge and the whole team who, under your chairmanship, have worked hard to ensure that Parliament has a position worthy of its status as a branch of the budgetary authority. In this capacity, we sought to formulate proposals designed to bring about economic recovery and intensify European solidarity while preserving the essential building blocks that are already part of the European edifice. Conscious of the difficulties experienced by some Member States, we had to produce a transitional Financial Perspective. Our negotiations culminated in a very reasonable draft which still contains crucial growth elements. Our duty, in fact, is to maximise the value added to national budgets by European intervention and to give Europe the means it requires to implement a project designed to bring progress in which all Member States can share. We must remember that, in the long run, expenditure at European level is a source of savings for national governments, particularly because European expenditure permits economies of scale and often enables Member States to make innovations and pursue policies that they could not have done independently. With a budget corresponding to 1.07% of GDP in payment appropriations, we shall have the resources to ensure that policies can be implemented in future. There has also been a need to break certain taboos. I am thinking here of the funding of the common agricultural policy, which will have to be reviewed if necessary in order to establish a fairer expenditure structure. I am also thinking of the British rebate, which must be challenged if we are to have a fairer own resources mechanism. I am thinking of the Cohesion Fund too, where we must create a transitional mechanism to avoid penalising those Member States that would no longer be eligible for support. In addition, all the institutions are called upon to intensify their efforts to achieve economy and efficiency. My last point on the payment appropriations is that the two elements of the present proposal are inseparable, namely the 1.7% in payment appropriations and the 24.2 billion for the flexibility instruments that are imperative if we are to develop the policies essential to growth and solidarity in the Union and the world. I should also like to emphasise two aspects of the present situation. The first concerns our disappointment at having been unable to finance Natura 2000 entirely outside the budget for rural development, to which we attached such great importance. The second concerns the demand we Socialists made for the ad hoc 
allocation of resources to the European Development Fund, which is an indispensable instrument for the improvement of decentralised cooperation. Finally, I should like to conclude by saying that Europe is experiencing difficulties at the present time, which I shall not spell out in detail. It has emerged clearly from these recent events that our citizens want a real Europe, a Europe that relates to them and communicates with them. This is precisely why it is very important to avail ourselves of this new heading. We are undoubtedly struggling today to find a political programme for Europe. We have objectives but not enough major projects and too few resources. It is essential to respond to people’s expectations, and I address these words directly to the Council. It is high time the Council was able to fulfil the hopes of the European peoples. There is an urgent need for it to face up to its responsibilities. We all need this budgetary framework in order to breathe fresh life into the economy and to regain public trust. We must overcome national self-interest and rediscover a mature approach to the European political project. There is nothing excessive about our demand, and that is why we are asking the Council to advance towards our position.

 Madam President, Commissioner, first of all, Madam President, I wanted to say that I very much regret that this essential report is being debated in the plenary at such a late hour. I wanted to congratulate Mr Pittella on this report and also for succeeding in the by no means trivial task of anticipating the Commission’s communication on its annual strategy some time ago. We do indeed want to continue to identify the European Union’s priorities, be successful in our continuing work on enlargement and above all succeed in re-launching the Lisbon policy. Mr Pittella has also succeeded in taking account of the current status of the negotiations on the future financial perspective. The objectives set out by the Commission in its communication are ambitious. But already we fear that the budgetary resources will not be commensurate with our hopes. For us, re-launching the Lisbon Strategy means above all creating high-quality jobs. We will therefore pay particular attention to assessing how realistic the aid to SMEs and micro-enterprises is and how it will be implemented. Thank you to our rapporteur for introducing a new notion into our budget: ethical financing instruments. The European Union should continue and indeed consolidate all of those actions that help to create social cohesion and promote human rights everywhere, as well as those that give our young people and our citizens opportunities to meet each other and listen to each other, thus gaining a better understanding of our culture and European identity. I am keen that we should continue to work with the Commission to set up pilot projects and preparatory actions. If we are to do so, we will also need to find new and better forms of communication. So far, despite our requests, the results really have fallen short of our expectations. The Commission needs to develop a professional strategy to meet our needs, which are to inform the public regularly about our political projects and the decisions taken by the Union. Before concluding, I should like to draw your attention to the amendment that we will be putting to the vote tomorrow. The solidarity fund should be available to all European citizens, regardless of where they are in the world, if disaster strikes. When providing aid, the European Union should keep its word and remember the commitments it has made about its objectives, in particular when it comes to giving development aid to the poorest countries of the world. We also need to support democratic change in those countries that expect European Union support. There too, we are going to lack sufficient resources. This year, once again, the ball will be in the Council’s court. We hope that it proves to be equal to its promises and commitments. The role of the European Union depends on it, as does the credibility, for our citizens, of our promises and projects.

Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, as Mr Ferber has just said, Mr Garriga Polledo’s report does not really pose a problem as we knew that, given the changes that have taken place in the Commission, we would probably need a supplementary and amending budget. I am going to start with a few comments on Mrs Jensen’s report on the SAB for the European Parliament. It is irrefutable with regard to the estimates for Parliament’s operating costs. We can only be concerned that these estimates were distorted for items as important as estimates for appropriations for salaries for officials and estimates for property appropriations. Our rapporteur’s recommendations calling on our administration to be more vigilant bear the mark of common sense. Through this report, we are also respecting our commitment to budgetary dialogue, as it still leaves the expenditure envisaged in the 2005 budget available to be spent, and even allows for financing Bulgaria and Romania’s accession to the Union with the non-allocated appropriations. There is, therefore, no reason to oppose this administrative action. With regard to the report on the guidelines for the appropriations for the other institutions presented to us today by Mr Dombrovskis, first of all I must thank him for his excellent work, and for the speed with which he has enabled us to debate and vote on these guidelines in this March sitting. Following in the tradition of our budgetary guidelines in this area, it is essential that all of the institutions continue the effort to complete enlargement with Bulgaria and Romania, which the 2006 budget must allow for. We share our rapporteur’s concerns. Only a last-minute controversy on the measures to be put in place in the Court of Justice will lead my group to better verify some solutions proposed in Mr Deprez’s report. Mr Dombrovskis’ report, backed up by the previous report by Mrs Jensen, points out that Parliament’s budget must enable it to equip itself with the additional resources to enable us to better respond to the scale of our task and the expectations of the citizens. In our view, a reduction in Parliament’s budget below the agreed 20% cannot be envisaged until such time as the policy of purchasing various premises for Parliament to have a presence and to carry out its work has come to an end. Above all, this budget is essential in order for Parliament to increase the interpreting and translation resources available to the various committees. I would also like to draw your attention to professional assistance for MEPs, which must be increased. The amounts allocated to each MEP for staff are absolutely inadequate given the complexity of Parliament’s new powers. Moreover, the lack of a statute for our assistants is a situation that is entirely unworthy of a political institution that places an innovative society that respects human rights at the heart of its work. Having a professional statute is a right for our assistants, but giving our assistants a statute is a duty for us as legislators. Likewise, I think that we should think about the problem of the statute for MEPs. When I hear some MEPs saying that it is difficult for them to join a pension scheme because of the cost of some of these schemes, I think that is entirely unworthy of the democratic institution that we are. Also, like Mrs Jensen, I wish to draw your attention to the problems with Parliament’s communication policy. This policy needs to be improved and while new resources are essential, new techniques and a new approach to communication are now a priority in our view. At a time when the draft constitutional treaty is being voted on by referendum or parliamentary vote, we know how essential this information for citizens is. But we need to establish simple, daily and effective information to pass on and decentralise the interest among citizens in the work that we do here. We see this as a priority that should not only be reflected in figures in the budget, but in good professional work by the ad hoc Parliament services. It is therefore clear to us that the idea of lowering the Parliament budget below 20% is not acceptable given our commitments and, above all, the expansion of our powers. As long as we lack the effective resources to fully carry out our task, we will not be able to get back to the principle that is essential to our role and therefore to European democracy.

Commissioner, Mr President, Mr President-in-Office of the Council, ladies and gentlemen, it is now my turn to thank all those involved in the budget on which we shall be voting in two days’ time: Mrs Jensen, Mr Garriga, Mr Böge and also all those who have been working with us. Once again, I wish to express how baffled I am at the method used for producing the budget and especially, for this second reading, at the manner in which our dialogue was held with the Council during November. It is true that we have reached an agreement and achieved results, but did it really need twelve hours to arrive at what should have been achievable by means of real methods of dialogue rather than a set of people who did real damage to the content of the budget? We have now reached payment appropriations of 1.05% of GDP, which is above the milestone of 1%. In return, however, we have obtained an unhoped-for result for the flexibility instrument that will allow us to finance our priorities in the short term thanks to an agreement on Heading 2. We actually feel that obtaining this result was extremely important, albeit highly unsatisfactory in the long run. At a time when we are negotiating the next financial perspectives, we think that this method will not allow us a real budget for real European policies and the Council’s reticence during these negotiations leads me to believe that, if we speak of a ceiling in the negotiations, Parliament should also provide for the concept of a floor beneath which a European budget makes no sense. Setting payment appropriations in stone while moving away from commitment appropriations is a usual strategy of the Council, but this is a strange course of action at a time when everyone – whether in the private sector or the public sector – is being asked to ensure transparency, reliability and truth when reading the budget figures. This cannot continue and the Union must be as strict with itself as it is with others. This situation enabled us to release the investments that we wanted in the very short term and my colleagues will speak to you about this. We also hope – and I am addressing the Commission at this point – that we shall see very good budget implementation this year, especially in the field of information and communication with the citizens. Like you, Commissioner, I hope that this year we shall make progress on the problem of setting up and implementing pilot projects, so that we are better able to meet our society’s expectations.  Finally, I am going to take a few minutes to say that one budget heading perplexed us. I turn this time towards my colleagues to say that, when we agreed to vote for the package on special events, we were entirely in agreement that the concept of European secularism should be fully implemented. You gave us your word that World Youth Day in Cologne is to be characterised by respect for other cultures and philosophies and that European money is to be used in an entirely secular way; you know, as I do, that we shall be watching carefully. The adoption of the other institutions’ budgets, which took place without any problems, leads me simply to say that we must review our expenditure here because, by imposing severe restrictions on our expenditure, we have ended up imposing limitations on ourselves and denied ourselves resources for working and exercising our power and our privileges with respect to the other institutions. In conclusion, I should like simply to say that this budget will certainly be implemented without any great problem in 2005, but that it is a transitional budget, which does not provide any real means of ensuring continuity and this is what is worrying us greatly. Nonetheless, I think that Mr Pittella will be able to take up the gauntlet even though this method cannot last and might hinder us in the future from achieving budgets to match our political projects.

Mr President, Commissioner, Mr President-in-Office of the Council, ladies and gentlemen, respecting Parliament’s desired political guidelines is an almost impossible task every year. For 2005, it was completely impossible, as it has been in other years, because, despite the agreement on the financial perspectives in force, the Council’s priorities mean not providing the resources our ambitions require. Respecting our priorities has, therefore, more to do with squaring the books than with reality. That has led the Socialist Group in the European Parliament to follow the strategy proposed by our rapporteur, Mr Garriga Polledo, whom I thank. This strategy consists of prioritising the policies decided on by Parliament, while calling on the Council to fulfil its commitments in terms of the operation of the agencies, just as for Heading V and the Union’s external policies, where the aid promised for Iran can be funded without difficulty from the sums available from the flexibility instrument of more than EUR 450 million. Only this strategy has allowed us to produce a budget which reflects the very reasonable orientations established by the Socialist Group for the European Union in 2005. With regard to Heading I, we are aware that we are only consulted and, with regard to Headings II and V, which do not raise any great problems today, we have followed the rapporteur. Nevertheless, by providing this draft budget with such reduced funding and distributing money in a random manner, the Council is expecting us to abandon what we hold most dear in terms of European integration: solidarity. By that I mean solidarity between the peoples of Europe, but also solidarity between Europe and the rest of the world. Without the involvement of the European Parliament, we would have had to choose between the geographical regions benefiting from the Union’s development policy. This is contrary to how we European Socialists view the geographical scope of the Union’s cooperation. We cannot create a hierarchy of suffering, hunger or oppression. We must act in any region we can, and provide ourselves with the necessary resources to do so. That is why, when we voted in committee, all the lines dedicated to cooperation were reinforced, regardless of geography. Similarly, we have reinforced the budgetary lines dedicated to the Lisbon strategy, for SMEs, employment and social dialogue. We believe that solidarity means prioritising growth and employment, because solidarity means sharing the fruits of growth. Finally, ladies and gentlemen, our last priority is inspired by European solidarity and consists of making the European Union’s information policy one of our fundamental policies. For the Union to be able to continue its actions, it is urgent that people understand the work it does. Our priority is to make the European Union’s intentions clear and visible. In our societies faced with violence and the spectre of recession, and witnessing the war in Iraq and in the world, the Union must be seen as a model for economic growth based on solidarity. This is the main requirement if we are to combat terrorism and continue to bring peace. Our budget, which we are presenting and on which we will vote on Thursday, must respect our priorities and be our main tool for implementing our political project. Finally, I do not wish to end without thanking our Commissioner, Mrs Schreyer, most warmly for the all the work she has done over the last five years. Like Mrs Jensen, I must acknowledge everything she has contributed to the budgetary procedure, to its renewal and modernisation. Mrs Schreyer, on behalf of my group, I would like thank you most warmly for what you have done together with us, the European Parliament, over the last five years, and wish you every success in continuing your work of pursuing our Union’s greatest possible democratic well-being. (Applause)

 Madam President, Mr Nicolaï, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, we have now reached the traditional debate on the Budget. Traditional it certainly is, and so, alas, are the Council’s proposals. Yet again, the Council has made very substantial cuts in the Commission’s preliminary draft Budget. Many times over, alas, we have had occasion to denounce such practices in your hearing, but today, at the outset of the debates on the financial perspectives, I think we have cause to be even more perturbed by this practice, for the Budget for the EU that the Council has put forward is an extremely restrictive one. In the preliminary draft Budget, we noted that there were significant increases in payments and commitments, which were necessary to the success of enlargement, and, now that we see these increases drastically curtailed, we know that the funding will not be there to enable the European Union to back up its promises. We find the restrictions proposed by the Council quite unacceptable, and, as previous speakers have said, that is the case under all the headings. Let me just dwell on a few points; to take one example, on the incoherence involved in reducing payments to the Structural Funds: as they have been used up, we need money in order to be able to do what we have promised. Turning to heading 3, that of internal affairs, everyone rehearsed the role of the agencies and the problems inherent in communicating with the public. I will also consider the role of micro-businesses and small and medium-sized enterprises in creating employment and will have something to say about the inconsistency of the Council’s approach to twinning. If we want to build the European Union, the citizens have to meet each other, yet, over the six years that I have been here to debate the Budget, we have seen twinning links cut back, which amounts to denying the citizens any involvement and to implying that twinning itself is not important. We will again have to amend the drafts, terrible though that is as a way of going about things, because we are the ones who will have to do it and we will all be wasting time introducing this sort of amendment at a time when we should be pooling our resources. I would also like to say something about the external actions. The Council’s draft Budget represents a tentative attempt at making economies in order to fund expenditure on Iraq, rather than on a truly ongoing vision of Europe’s external action. Less EUR 15 million for TACIS, less EUR 25 million for MEDA, less EUR 16 million for CARDS, less EUR 9 million for Latin America. Has poverty died out? Are there no more problems? Far from it, to be sure; what has changed is that the Commission is far better – and yes, it really is – at implementing its budgets. We, in fact, are keen that the Council should find other means of funding Iraq, and also that the EU should keep the promises it made to all the peoples concerned, as it does those it makes to its own citizens. Yet again, the Council has opted for an actuarial approach by seeking, as a matter of priority, to make savings on the revenue needed to balance the Budget. When preparing the preliminary draft budget, the Commission had asked for 1.03% of GNP and, as if by chance, the draft budget has 0.99%, less, you see, than the symbolic figure of 1% on which some rely in order to be able to cut back their national budget. It is perfectly clear what is going on: the figures have been adopted in an attempt to get a pseudo-draft accepted. Well, we, in this House, will go ahead and do the precise opposite. We want to start from the draft and from the promises made to the public, and, on that basis, produce a budget that is well funded and of use to all. It follows that we have to clarify what our plans for today’s Europe are, and set ourselves goals, rather than decide on an arbitrary figure. As we see it, Europe’s ambition must reflect that of the Heads of State at their summits. There is a marked contradiction between what is said by Europe’s advocates and what is said by the Council. From the point of view of the Budget, it is impossible to achieve the goals that the EU has set itself with such paltry funding. We want growth in Europe, solidarity in Europe; we want more competitiveness and more of the Lisbon spirit; we want to make Europe homogeneous and prosperous, to see it consolidating its social model and its potential for growth, for land redistribution, for investment in research, for development, for funding great political and development projects. We will see to it that Parliament will honour its promises and the undertakings that the Council has been unable to include in its draft Budgets. (Applause)

 Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, this evening we are coming to the end of the first phase of the work of examining the Commission proposal on the conditions for the marketing of construction products. I wish, in this respect, to thank the Commission for its technical support, and I also wish to thank all of the shadow rapporteurs for their receptiveness and their willingness to engage in dialogue, which has enabled us gradually to arrive at the same positions and to reach agreement on major points of this issue. Whilst it is true that we fully support the objectives of the reform, which are to improve the market’s operation, to give credibility to the CE label and to simplify the system, and that we share the unquestionable interest in having a common technical language, a broad majority of the members of the Committee on Internal Market and Consumer Protection were anxious to air their doubts. These doubts can be explained in the first place by our unanimous desire to avoid simplifying and relaxing procedures and thus curbing product control and declarations. They also arise from the position of the Commission which, in our view, tends to be happy with a situation in which product assessment criteria are in part left up to the Member States, so that the real meaning of the CE label depends on the country in which the products are marketed, thus causing problems of credibility. Our reservations are based finally on the fact that, at a time when we wish to take Europe down the road of a green economy, the text proposed to us deals neither with the energy performance of products nor with their partial harmfulness to users. To answer these concerns, the Committee on the Internal Market and Consumer Protection has introduced a series of changes. I personally will mention five of them. We propose, in the first place, to maintain the obligation for construction products placed on the market to have the CE label, in order to guarantee that everything sold in Europe has undergone the appropriate control procedures. This choice must not contribute to creating extra burdens on the weakest companies, thus handicapping their activity. That is why we have defended maintaining simplified procedures for micro-enterprises and why we have introduced a measure exempting small-scale craftspeople from a compulsory CE label. The second point concerns the simplified procedures to make access to the CE label easier. We have, however, decided to reserve access to these procedures to manufacturers of construction products, not to importers. This approach, which is aimed at improving the supervision of the market, will enable us to prevent low quality products from being imported by dubious import companies. The third major change is the introduction of a minimum level of harmonisation as regards the criteria for assessing construction products in Europe. This is to ensure that the CE label has the same meaning in whichever country the product is marketed in. Where possible, we would in fact like the requirements applied to product assessment in Europe to be the same in all the Member States. To this end, we have also introduced the option of creating new assessment criteria that are not merely technical, but can also be used to measure performance on subjects of general interest, such as the environment, safety and health risks. To the same end – and this will be my fourth point – we have helped to significantly enhance the user information provided by manufacturers in the declaration of performance. Manufacturers will, in particular, have to declare any harmful substances appearing henceforth on an annexed list, which also includes the substances mentioned in the REACH Directive. Finally, and this is my last point, the members of the Committee on Internal Market and Consumer Protection have tried to introduce more transparency in relation to the certification conditions for construction products, more transparency in relation to the companies’ role in the certification process, and more transparency, too, in relation to the clarification of the conditions of access to the CE label, clearly distinguishing the access routes for products covered by a harmonised standard from the route reserved for products that are not and that are often referred to as innovative products. This work is in fact coming to an end, but it has not reached the stage that we wanted. The difficulties faced in the Council as regards formulating a position meant that one could not be agreed, despite good cooperation from the French Presidency and the Czech Presidency. Today, I regret this, although I am aware that the extra time allocated to us might allow us, at second reading, to achieve a much broader consensus and, above all, to have more meaningful discussions, where these positions for this sector will be voiced.
 Catherine Neris,  
rapporteur.
 – (FR)
 Mr President, thank you, Commissioner, thank you, ladies and gentlemen, for having contributed so fully to this work. I will make just one comment: I have indeed taken into account all that has been said because I think that this work should continue. For us, it is important for this sector to be a little more structured within the Community, but, above all, for the standard, which we would like to be a little more exhaustive as regards the CE label, to be much more consistent. In this respect, our wish is above all for further European integration for a better Europe, and, indeed, further integration for these sensitive sectors, because we know that they are at the heart of our economies and are also levers for economic recovery. There is also a need to address all the points that we have mentioned. The last thing I wanted to say relates in fact to what Mr Schwab was saying about all the studies. We will take into account the studies that have been completed, of course, not just to confirm what we have done, but to make any reassessment that proves necessary. I believe that for us it is essential that we put our heads together in this sector, and we will do so. Thank you, Commissioner, for holding these fruitful exchanges, and I hope in any case that, at second reading, this text will be both consistent with and adapted to the needs of our companies in particular.

Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, the report on which the House will vote tomorrow rightly reminds us that the specificities of the outermost regions are also among their strengths. Alongside the handicaps that hold them back, they also have undeniable advantages and we urgently need to build on those advantages so that the ORs can develop in a real and sustainable way in the future. Bringing fresh impetus to our islands also implies growth: it implies putting high-quality agricultural production – which contributes to diversity of agricultural output at EU level – on a sustainable footing. It implies promoting the rapid development of a very real tourist attraction based on the wealth of our various landscapes and our cultural heritage. It also implies taking advantage of the geographical position of the ORs, particularly in the Caribbean and the Indian Ocean, encouraging closer cooperation with neighbouring third countries and developing our islands – precisely because they are islands – as centres of excellence for scientific research, notably in maritime studies, climatology and environmental studies. The only way of achieving these aims, however, is within the specific regulatory framework of the current Article 299(2) of the Treaty, and the spirit of that article must inform the detailed application of European public policy, particularly in the energy and transport sectors but also in relation to international trade policies, where it is vital that the interests of the ORs are taken into account in the negotiation of Economic Partnership Agreements. The outermost regions are genuinely and unfailingly proactive, but the corollary of that is a need to be treated fairly – which implies differentiation. Let us not doubt that the Commission will take all this into account in preparing its approach.

Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I would like to congratulate the rapporteur for having produced an excellent piece of work and for having collaborated so well on what is a particularly sensitive issue. At a time of increasing trade not only within the Union but also with third countries, the opening-up of markets and expanding commercial activity are set to represent key development factors for Europe for years to come. However, the gradual removal of the barriers that define the European Economic Area also opens the door to a host of fraudulent activities that threaten the viability of the internal market, with Community producers, and by extension European consumers, counting among the first victims. This problem is especially prominent in the agricultural sector, where the crucial measures that have been put in place to provide farmers with financial aid and solidarity have attracted the greedy eyes of international crime on both a small and large scale. In this context, and given the shortcomings of the present controls, Europe is preparing to arm itself with a new regulation that will permit a better distribution of data among the Member States with regard to the movement of goods and the various investigations that are being carried out in the different countries of the Union. I welcome the compromise that has been found with the Council, which now gives us a more balanced document, the details of which are to be voted on tomorrow by the Members of this Parliament. While continuing to protect the various aspects of private life, the agreement should help improve the effectiveness of surveillance procedures and lead to better coordination of actions undertaken between each of the Member States. In the area of customs controls, as elsewhere, I am convinced that Europe can only develop through greater combination of effort and by the pooling of our respective resources so that we can give our citizens the level of protection they desire. In this respect, any improvement in the measures we have for combating fraud cannot be achieved without also maintaining a consistent level of regulation, for this is essential if we are to retain sound and effective control from above of the commercial activities under way both within the Union and with third countries.

 Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, I would like to congratulate the authors of this resolution and give them my support. The soaring price of cereals and therefore of foodstuffs generally reflects Europe’s current dependence on the volatility of world agricultural markets. Accepting this situation would mean accepting that consumers are becoming a variable for adjustment during the correction phases of these markets. Accepting this situation also means denying the influence of the large supermarkets, which for 40 years have contributed to the downward trend in prices for farmers, while food prices for consumers have stayed the same or have increased. This excessive margin capture could have, and should have, been used by the large supermarkets to absorb the rising cost of agricultural raw materials in the crisis we are currently experiencing. Clearly this is not happening. The large supermarkets are continuing to abuse their dominant position and the Commission must now discuss this question as a matter of urgency so as to prevent European consumers from being held hostage to an unfair and dangerous system.
 Catherine Trautmann,

 Madam President, I would first of all like to point out that, in relation to the request for a change on the voting list, if I have understood rightly, if the compromise was included by the services, using their common sense, before groups tabled the amendment, it is because it goes further than Amendment 46. It includes clauses that are not limited merely to restricting access to the Internet but that also include all devices that may adversely affect users’ rights. Secondly, I would also like to tell the Members that this compromise has been tabled in Article 1, which relates to the scope, and that it therefore has an across-the-board effect, whilst the amendment tabled by the groups concerns Article 8, which affects the objectives of the national regulators. Throughout the negotiations on this compromise, I have worked faithfully and harmoniously with all of the political groups. I note, Madam President, that at this very moment one of the groups has withdrawn its signature from this compromise. I would therefore like to say to you that, as rapporteur, I continue, of course, to support this compromise, and that I have also voted in favour of Amendment 46. I would like to say that, in the circumstances in which we are holding the debate, it is wiser for our House to decide on the voting order, rather than leave it up to you or the rapporteur alone to take this decision. However, I would like to present this request to you very directly, as it must be understood what happens next if the vote is reversed. If the vote is not reversed, the list stays the same. If the vote is reversed, Amendment 46 is adopted if it obtains the qualified majority. In that case, Madam President, I would also ask you to put the compromise – which goes further than Amendment 46 – to the vote after this vote is taken. If Amendment 46 does not obtain the qualified majority, at that stage we will vote on the compromise and, therefore, our House will have made its choice.
 Catherine Trautmann,  
rapporteur.

 Madam President, I asked that we also be able to vote on the compromise, as it has a broader scope than Amendment 46 alone. You decided not to put this compromise to the vote without giving us any explanation and without giving any reply to the rapporteur. I wanted you to be aware of this and to tell you that I regret that our recommendation has not been followed, just like the rapporteur’s recommendation on our House’s vote. I would also like to say – to explain the vote that has just taken place – that when any part of the entire compromise is not adopted, it is the whole package that is subject to conciliation. That is the consequence of the vote that is being taken today.

Madam President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, tomorrow we shall be voting on the telecoms package, the final stage that will mark the end of months of work and negotiations to arrive at this compromise, which was reached after much wrangling with the Council in a context where the three institutions started from very different positions. I want first of all to thank very sincerely Mrs del Castillo Vera, Mr Harbour, Mrs Pleguezuelos Aguilar, the shadow rapporteurs, the political groups, the chairmen of the committees and their secretariats, the Presidency of the Council and the European Commission for their tireless work throughout these long months, and I thank all those fellow Members who have chosen to place their confidence in me by giving me their support. This package brings numerous advances. They are important for consumers because they offer better services at fairer prices. Telecommunications are in fact characterised by their impact on everyday life and play an obvious social role as a medium for development and growth. The telecommunications sector alone provides more than 3.5 million jobs and accounts for an increasingly large share of the European economy – almost 3.5%. Well-regulated competition allows for a balance between old and new operators and ensures significant growth for the sector thanks to legal certainty, which in turn encourages investment. That is why, throughout this round of negotiations, we have fought, together with my fellow rapporteurs and our shadow rapporteurs, to make a regulatory framework that is beneficial for all. The Committee on Industry, Research and Energy approved in April the penultimate stage in the legislative process by adopting by a very large majority the overall compromise on my report and the report by Mrs del Castillo Vera. We have laid the basis for a solid compromise which, I hope, will receive – together with the reports by Mr Harbour and Mrs Pleguezuelos Aguilar – your full support in tomorrow’s vote. I would like also to come back to Amendment 138/46 and to make clear the meaning and scope of the text underpinning the agreement of Parliament and of the Council, the so-called ‘last chance compromise’. Since the vote on this amendment at first reading the Council has continued to reject it outright, excluding it from its common position and refusing to mention it in the recitals or the articles. The European Parliament has shown its commitment to this amendment by including in the compromise the key elements of Amendment 46: defence of freedoms, 
right to a judgment and recourse to a court – 
the expression most in line with that of judicial authority – and has introduced two additional provisions for Internet users: the confirmation of the Internet’s vital role in the exercise of fundamental rights and freedoms, with specific reference made to the European Convention for the Protection of Human Rights and Fundamental Freedoms. The spirit and the letter of Amendment 46 have therefore been respected and extended for the benefit of users, and the rejection of this amendment by Member States on the grounds that the European Parliament cannot impose a change in their internal judicial organisation – which would be required in order to implement this amendment – has thus been avoided. Its place in Article 1, which concerns the scope and the objectives, makes this proposal in essence a principle that applies to all the directives in the package, particularly where access and services are concerned. This therefore rectifies the legal weakness that resulted from linking Amendment 46 to Article 8, which defines the tasks of national regulators. Ladies and gentlemen, we are faced with a choice: to support Amendment 46 as it is, and thus refer the whole telecoms package back to a conciliation process, which will reopen the discussion on all the points established in the negotiations and will lead to its being quashed because of the massive opposition from Member States to this amendment, or to support the new wording of Amendment 46, which ensures respect for fundamental freedoms, thus confirming what Parliament adopted at the time of the vote on the Lambrinidis report. I would add that the presence of Article 1(3)(a) and its recital will have to be taken into account in the transposition of the directive, and that they will enable Parliament to legislate afterwards. Faced with this impossible choice, I invite you, ladies and gentlemen, to think about the future of our work in the next parliamentary term, which will focus, among other things, on universal service but also on content and intellectual property, and I therefore invite you to support the new proposal, in an effort to put the rights of employees, artists and Internet users on an equal footing.
 Catherine Trautmann,  
rapporteur. 
− (FR) 
Madam President, thank you very much, Commissioner, for your statement, which sheds very positive light on the debate that has just taken place, and I thank all those fellow Members who took part. I would like to say that our Parliament, in voting in favour of this compromise on the telecoms package, will be indicating a clear choice: that of a regulated market, and not of unregulated competition. It is evidence also of a strategy, a useful strategy of development in a context of crisis and which prepares European society for the digital age. This vote will also make it possible to ensure a balance between the rights of States and the competences of the Commission, between the old operators and the new entrants, thanks to the non-discrimination clauses, but it will also signify that progress is being made by the European Parliament itself, in the exercise of its codecision powers, particularly in the matter of spectrum policy allocation, which is considered a public good, and in the support it expresses, once again, for broadcasters and services. Many fellow Members spoke about the issue of the Internet as a public space which, as such, requires freedom and security, and I agree with them. Consequently a link has been made between Internet accessibility and the fundamental rights of citizens, for the first time in a directive, with the new version of Amendment 46. Indeed, the expression ‘measures taken’ acts in a way as a missing link between any measures taken concerning electronic communications networks, whether it be terminating access or filtering, and the fundamental rights of users. With regard to the doubts expressed by my fellow Members about the rapporteur’s willingness to defend the right to a court judgment before cutting off access, I must say that the expression ‘independent and impartial court’ is an expression that guarantees Internet users the right to such a judgment. Proving that Hadopi would be an independent and impartial court would mean imposing on this high authority all the obligations that a judge has to respect: the right of defence, a trial in which both parties are heard, and publicity. Obviously this would cause a system which relies, as the French law arguably does, on the computerisation and massification of accusations and penalties, to implode. Therefore, I call on the European Commission to take the greatest care when transposing this telecoms package. When a fundamental principle is enshrined in a Community text that is the subject of a compromise between the Council and the European Parliament as colegislators, it must be transposed properly into national laws. I would like to conclude, ladies and gentlemen, by saying that I am delighted by the prospect of a wide, multi-partnership-style public consultation, which will allow us to follow up on our hard work, in the framework of a compromise that respects the law set out in Amendment 46 and makes it applicable.

Mr President, Madam Commissioner, we are about to vote on the Telecoms package, one of the most sensitive proposals of the closing period of this parliamentary term. My fellow rapporteurs, Mrs del Castillo Vera and Mr Harbour, and I have worked together closely to achieve a coherent and efficient proposal for the end-users of these directives, namely the Commission and regulators, but one that is also positive and valuable to those looking for legal certainty, encouragement for investment, and a dynamic and balanced market, that is, operators and their employees, as well as for the primary beneficiaries of the numerous services and quality at a fair and accessible price: the consumers. All of us – rapporteurs, draftsmen and shadow rapporteurs – were united in these aims and that is why we were able to reach a solid compromise, attested to by the small number of amendments on which we are to vote. I would like to express my profound gratitude to all the rapporteurs, the chairmen of the committees responsible and committees asked for opinions, their secretariats and all the political groups. I also wish to thank the colleagues that have shown an interest in this matter and contributed to our work. I now call on my fellow Members to support their rapporteurs and draftsmen through their vote and to grant them a clear and decisive mandate for the period of codecision that will follow. Finally, I hope that the Commission and Council will respond positively to Parliament’s amended version of the package, which, although it represents in many regards an alternative to the Commission’s initial vision, still presents as many areas of agreement between our three institutions.

Mr President, we have a relatively difficult decision with regard to Amendment 138, for which three requests for a split vote have been tabled. I personally tabled an oral amendment to the first part of the amendment, which is included on the voting list and reads: ‘applying the principle that no restriction may be imposed on the fundamental rights and freedoms of end-users’.
 That is the first oral amendment. Since then, we have been looking for a solution acceptable to the political groups in relation to the third part of the amendment. I therefore propose a new oral amendment, with the backing of the signatories, including the Chairman of the Committee on Industry, Research and Energy, Mrs Niebler, and others, which would read: ‘save when public security is threatened where the ruling may be subsequent’. This would replace the third part and clarify matters, as the third part proposed by Mr Bono is ambiguous as regards the exception. By making this clarification, we have a readable and acceptable amendment. Incidentally – for the benefit of Mrs Hieronymi – it has nothing to do with intellectual property, as she was saying.

 Madam President, Commissioner, Ministers, ladies and gentlemen, for the reform of the regulatory framework that we are discussing to be justifiable, it has to bring about tangible improvements, both for consumers in terms of prices, access and connection speed and for companies in terms of the prospect of fair competition, new investment and competitiveness. The large number of stakeholders involved means that there are divergent, even contradictory, interests at play. For my part, from a very early stage, I made a point of listening to views on all sides and also of sending a timely and reliable message to companies and consumers in order to build or rebuild their trust. Electronic communications are a real opportunity for European growth. The sector accounts for 3% of European GDP. We still need to be able to reap the full benefits of this potential in the EU in terms of investment and the development of services. This requires competition, but not competition alone. Steps need to be taken to create conditions for responsible and sustainable development; in other words, to build an ecosystem for the sort of knowledge economy that we all want to see. We must now consider ICT as a resource. It is therefore a matter of both public and private concern that requires us to support flexible rules and the responsibility of all stakeholders through cooperation between regulators and the Commission, in the same way that operators and customers cooperate on the basis of a contractual agreement. There are four key areas that I want to see strengthened: firstly, customer service, whether in terms of access – through the more widespread territorial deployment of networks – fair prices or quality; secondly, sustained industrial activity with a view to stimulating job creation and innovation, since technological progress is also effective in bringing down prices; thirdly, the competitiveness of small and large companies in order to guarantee sustainable competition in the EU Member States and the necessary investment, especially in fibre optics, that will enable us to compete more effectively in a global market; and, finally, legal certainty – the need to ensure the reliability of the system by giving responsibility to those involved and encouraging mutual cooperation, especially among regulators but also between regulators and the Commission. I was pleased to note that, on this basis, the Committee on Industry, Research and Energy accepted my compromise proposals – often by a large majority – and I should like to thank my colleagues for making themselves so readily available, despite deadlines that were, at times, rather tight but which meant that we have been able to keep to the timetable with a view to achieving the objective of amending this Regulation before the end of the current parliamentary term. This is the result of a collective effort. I personally feel that the sector has generally responded positively to these guidelines, and I hope that our partners in the Council will do likewise. I have listened carefully to Mr Chatel and Mr Besson and their views, as well as to Commissioner Reding, and I should like to thank them for their informed and generally positive opinions. To come back to the points that are still under discussion, I should like to talk about the issue of remedies. Without any encroachment on the powers of national regulators, a consensus has emerged on the need for a more consistent application of remedies at EU level. However, there has been unanimous – or almost unanimous – rejection of the Commission proposal that it should have the right to veto remedies. Under the mechanism provided for in my report, each body has its rightful place: the Commission may raise doubts about a remedy but cannot completely reject it unless BERT also delivers a negative opinion. Conversely, for functional separation to be imposed as a remedy, this would require the agreement of both the Commission and BERT. With a restriction of this nature, such separation remains a tangible threat but one which cannot be imposed lightly. As regards radio spectrum, our proposals are directed towards more flexible management of this scarce resource but in a moderate and proportionate manner, whilst, at the same time, introducing measures aimed at optimising spectrum management. For us, the first building block is a genuine European spectrum policy that could be presented, once the package has been adopted, at a major conference to be held early in the next parliamentary term. As regards new networks, these were absent from the Commission proposal, or poorly addressed, at a time when Europe is already involved in this technological revolution. We felt that it was essential immediately to provide the Member States and regulators with the guidelines and tools that they need to encourage investment and manage, where necessary, the deployment of these networks. For this reason, our proposals were validated by a panel of recognised experts just before the summer holidays. A final issue has arisen rather late in the day: the protection of intellectual property rights. It is unfortunate that this debate has come to the fore at this stage in the review of the telecom package; I think that it would be out of place to discuss mechanisms for ensuring full respect for intellectual property rights here. I just want to say that I hope that we shall be able to complete the review of this Package without undue pressure and without being disrupted by this issue, albeit an important one, given that creative content is the subject of a Commission communication. I shall deal with the remaining points in the two minutes that I have to conclude.
 Catherine Trautmann,  
rapporteur

 Madam President, at the end of this debate, I should like to thank the Council and the Commissioner for listening so carefully to what we had to say; this has enabled them to see that there is quite considerable consensus, a great deal of agreement, in our Parliament on the telecom package. Nothing could be more common in our everyday lives than a mobile phone, a television set or the ability to communicate. The Single Act established the mobility of persons and goods as a fundamental right, a fundamental freedom. As Mr Paasilinna said earlier, communications are also a fundamental right and a means of giving Europe a soul, sustaining its existence and connecting its citizens. We must therefore have the necessary ambition to make a success of this telecom package. I therefore urge the Council not to proceed with a compromise or with a willingness to compromise that might unbalance the various points on which we have managed to reach agreement. Between us, and with the help of my colleagues, Malcolm Harbour, Pilar del Castillo, Alexander Alvaro and others – it would be impossible to mention them all – we feel that we have already achieved a great deal on the basis of common sense and shared determination. In response to the remarks directed towards me earlier by Mr Toubon, I should also like to say that I cannot be criticised for not wishing to take into account the need to support the creative process in Europe. I believe that it is a powerful driving force for innovation, both in terms of the diversity and the intellectual value that it brings, which is absolutely critical in this day and age. However, we must also take into account the freedom that must be guaranteed in our texts – we have adopted extremely important texts on the protection of personal data, and we are the only ones to have done so in the world today. We must reconcile these two aspects. There is no conflict between the two: the objective is the same, namely to protect both creative freedom and the freedom of each individual. It is in this spirit that we shall continue to work to improve our proposals.

Mr President, although I am speaking after my colleague Mr Hökmark, I do not share the position he has just outlined. I believe that just as we are on the brink of adopting this energy package we must keep in mind three challenges. The first is the energy challenge or the climate challenge, which highlights the extent to which we must be mindful of the nature of gas as a resource and treat it in a very specific way. The second challenge is the one our fellow citizens are bringing to our attention: price. Their spending power is currently affected by the price of oil; they want to have access to a high-quality, reliable constant resource, and for their interests in particular to be protected. Then, of course, we have the challenge of companies and the challenge of employees. There are many fears at present: both among consumers as regards their access to energy, and among employees faced with the prospect of the dismantling of gas companies. That is why, Mr President, I believe that we must pay very close attention to all the solutions that are suggested. Since it is important to talk about it, I will mention the issue of the third option. I would first of all like to thank my colleagues in the ITRE Committee, who in their wisdom adopted the Vidal-Quadras/Laperrouze compromise last month. I firmly believe that this consensual approach allowing each of our Member States to make the necessary improvements to their gas markets, in accordance with their traditions, will be a useful basis for discussion with the Council, and I would like to call on my colleagues to confirm that basis. Of course, when prices are higher awareness of the delicate nature of climate change is heightened. However, we must respond to these three challenges, the ecological dimension and the dimension of security of supply, and we must therefore chose the best option, which is the third.

 Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, finally we have arrived at the eve of the vote in Parliament regarding the S band, which has been so highly anticipated by the operators and by the majority of the Member States. We note the significance of these frequencies, which so far have not been used and whose capacity to transmit mobile television, data or emergency services is now recognised, and which Parliament has expressed its particular commitment to. It is true that the method cannot be optimal. This somewhat ‘impressionist’ approach, which has consisted of establishing a frequency plan in small brush strokes, has shown some limitations. We will seek to remedy this when we examine the Telecommunications Regulatory Package. With regard to mobile satellite services, fundamentally the final result offers a balance between political ambition and economic feasibility. In particular, Parliament insisted on the degree of geographical coverage in order to protect against the risk of a digital gulf being created between Member States, but also within them. The weighing up of the criteria for the ‘beauty contest’ is a true reflection of the respective weight of the concerns of Parliament and of European citizens, in particular in relation to public services. Finally, the possibility of to some extent requisitioning the frequencies allocated in the event of a disaster is in line with the current discussions within the ITU, where the contribution of telecommunications to protecting human life was examined last year at the global conference. As shadow rapporteur for the Socialist Group, I must stress how pleasant it was to work with Mrs Hall, our rapporteur, whose utter determination was clear. I also commend the Slovenian Presidency for its effective contribution. It was given a baptism of fire by being faced with a really thorny issue. Finally, I would like to commend the willingness of our Commissioner, Mrs Reding, the technical cooperation between the Commission services, the Secretariat of the Committee on Industry, Research and Energy, and the legal and language experts from the two joint legislators who enabled us to produce a quality text. I am also happy to have chaired the two trialogues that helped to clarify the points to be debated and resolved. Parliament was conciliatory in the finalisation of the agreement with the Council in view of the short timescale in relation to satellite programming and the economic and industrial stakes. The financial investment to be made is sizeable and risky, and we all want it to succeed. This is why I am concluding this intervention by calling on the Presidency and the Commission so that we can hear them make a commitment that the timescales for the adoption of the text and the publication of the call for candidates before the summer will be respected.

 Madam President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, as Europe gradually equips itself with instruments to limit climate change associated with greenhouse gas emissions, as European citizens experience the full force of the energy price rises, it is of course important finally to establish a legal basis for the collection and dissemination of energy statistics. However, we feel it is just as important to make them consistent with the challenges we are facing: saving energy and redefining our energy mix, with fewer fossil energies and far more renewable energies. The new elements of this regulation are therefore more a coherent redefinition of the scope of the statistics than a series of sporadic additions. My approach as shadow rapporteur for the Socialist Group in the European Parliament will have been to ensure that these statistics can be even more useful to European citizens, but also to those who govern them. They become more reliable for analyses and more useful as an aid to decision-making. For citizens, we have fought for and obtained more transparent statistics that provide information about what affects them most: housing and transport, but also the nuclear industry. For governments, the most up-to-date statistics possible will be available for the usual Energy Councils held each spring. We will see how far these objectives are met. In the meantime, the result of these changes is, in my view, quite restrained, that is they do not unduly increase the workload of the Member States or the various partners involved. It is on this point that I would like to thank our rapporteur, Mr Turmes, for his sense of compromise, along with his whole team. Finally, I would again like to applaud the very valuable and efficient support given throughout by Eurostat to help produce a result that is now recognised as robust.

Madam President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, the Second Internet Governance Forum was held in Rio from 12 to 15 November last year, and was attended by 2 100 people from all five continents representing interested Internet parties from all public and private sectors. The forum provides a favourable context in which to seek solutions to future ICT problems. Through a common culture and a partnership format, it provides the decisions to be taken at future world summits on the information society, in addition to those to be taken by our own states. It also provides the opportunity to hold an open reflection on the complex nature of the Internet and make timely provision for its technical, ethical and legal limitations, since there are major concerns in addition to the issues close to EU hearts: reducing the digital divide, freedom of expression on the web, cultural diversity and child protection. I could also RFID, radio frequency identification, in short, the formation of an Internet of things, the risks of network overload by 2010-2012, digitalisation, particularly of cultural goods, the consequences arising in terms of the protection of intellectual property and, above all, improvement of access to ICT for less developed countries. Europe is certainly up to speed in terms of the legislative process. This is encouraging for us as Europeans, but we must not slacken off. Many of these legal or regulatory issues are likewise improved with the review of the Telecom Package. In this respect, I would call for a new phase of targeted political and future-oriented work, notably through the creation of a European IGF involving the national parliaments and local authorities: a European forum implemented by 2009 and perhaps a world forum in Europe thanks to Lithuania’s application for 2010. As delegation head, I wish to thank all Members, colleagues and officials for their work and their availability. The resolution we will be voting on constitutes a roadmap. I am pleased it enjoys the support of all of the groups in Parliament. More parliamentary committees are welcome to lend their weight to this course of action, and I would like to thank the Commission and ask its Members to lend their support to Mrs Reding. Finally, I would like to ask the Council to include in its agenda relations with India and preparations for the New Delhi forum, and I would urge all Member States to participate in enhanced cooperation.

 Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, I wish to begin by quoting my colleague Henri Weber. This text is an acceptable compromise for the Socialist Group and, during the negotiations, we succeeded in adding some valuable provisions to preserve the European audiovisual model. I wish to thank our rapporteur, Mrs Hieronymi, for her determination, patience and also a particularly open and positive spirit of compromise. Certain issues in relation to the digital revolution within the context of the knowledge economy made this review necessary. The rules have been extended, in an appropriate manner, to the new audiovisual services. Protection of minors is guaranteed, as is the protection of EU citizens from incitement to all discrimination. These new services shall contribute to the financing of films and the European audiovisual component. A percentage of their turnover will be paid into support accounts, and there will be guaranteed exposure of European productions in on-line catalogues. Pluralism in the media has now become an official requirement. The role of the regulatory authorities has been enhanced, and the adoption of provisions in relation to accessibility for all is recommended most strongly to the Member States. In terms of advertising, the Socialist Group wanted to retain the rules of the current Directive. With advertising limited to 20% per hour, the duration between two advertising screens is now 30 minutes, whereas we wanted to retain 45 minutes for European screens. We are nonetheless satisfied that product advertising is banned during documentaries, information broadcasts and children’s programmes. The Member States may, however, choose to allow this kind of advertising for films, television fiction and sports broadcasts. In this case there are strict regulations for product placement in order to prevent abuse and certain perverse effects. A balance has therefore been found between freedom of expression, circulation of information, public access to new services such as VOD (video on demand), and content with a cultural and economic value. The emphasis on quality will allow European production to strengthen its position. This is one of the major effects of the directive.

Mr President, colleagues, on 3 October the Michelin group announced that it is to cease tyre production at its Toul plant. More than 800 jobs are likely go by 2009, although neither the company’s industrial performance nor its financial results indicate any crisis behind these redundancies. Shareholders are selling off equity at a profit, on the back of the restructuring announcement, while ordinary men and women come to terms with the fact that they alone will bear the brunt of the situation. I should like to put on record before the House how much I respect the trade union representatives and workers who, despite the deeply gloomy prospect they face, have shown a tremendous sense of responsibility from the outset. The issue now is not about finding a humane way of closing a factory; it is about finding ways of retaining jobs in areas such as this, which can be extremely hard hit. The workforce in Toul expects the EU to create systems of protection and organisation that will be capable of securing workers’ social rights, helping people to get back into employment, and putting compensation funds to good use in relaunching industrial projects. What they need is the flexisecurity that we, as European Socialists, have been urging; but it is also essential to encourage adaptation to industrial competitiveness and explore ways of promoting an integrated industrial policy for the benefit of all the areas in Europe currently affected by restructuring.

 Madam President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, it is pleasing to see the subject of ‘dys’-type disorders, so often ignored, now being raised in Parliament and the fact that this topic has generated a response from practically all the political groups that make up this House demonstrates that for us no citizen of Europe, whatever their problems, should be subjected to discrimination. Such is the case for ‘dys’ sufferers, for increasingly sophisticated studies have shown that while this type of disability is still very widespread it is still not being properly identified. As the only French Member to speak this evening I can pride myself on the fact that France has been fairly active in its efforts to tackle ‘dys’ problems. Thanks to the initiative of parents’ associations and professional groups, a national day, the first of its kind, is now to be held in Paris on 10 October and it is hoped that this will make the press more aware of the situation of the people, and especially children, who are affected by problems of this kind. However, the purpose of my question this evening is not to celebrate the positive advances made in one country or another, since there is still a huge amount of work to be done, but collectively to discuss ways in which we might pool the best practices that have been developed at European level, insomuch as certain Member States do not even recognise the existence of this type of disorder. It appears to me that the call for a European multidisciplinary network to be set up for specific training and learning problems, which is part of the written declaration, goes some way in this direction. A judicious use of Community actions such as the Seventh Framework Programme would also be beneficial. In this respect, the initiative that you mentioned, Commissioner, namely the NeuroDys project, which is aimed at highlighting the cognitive, cerebral and genetic origins of dyslexia, and which brings together 15 scientific research groups from nine Member States – and in passing I would like to point out, for this is important, that this body includes practically all the European languages – seems to set a good example because ultimately it appears to me that Europe should lead the world in understanding these conditions and in collecting the biological data that relate to them. However, it should also set an example in recognising the most effective forms of rehabilitation and therapy so that children can begin to hope again and face life with optimism. Does the Commission have plans for other programmes of this type in the future? Commissioner, you referred to a call for tenders that received no response. It is our intention that the awareness campaign now being waged by the various associations and by the Members who signed the written declaration should perhaps make up for this lack of information and motivation. We hope that your capacity for mobilising the European funding that is needed to fulfil these expectations will enable the relevant research to be carried out into other ‘dys’-type disorders, such as dyspraxia and dysphasia.

 Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, I would like first of all to thank the Commission for its commitment to bridging the gap that exists in the broadband technology sector, which is regarded as a factor not only in speeding up economic and social integration but also in reducing various forms of discrimination. Having access to this sort of technology at a reasonable price does in fact appear to be an essential throughout the EU, firstly in order to guarantee high-quality service, secondly in order to promote competitiveness and productivity throughout the EU and to do so at the same time as respecting the environment, since certain physical displacements become superfluous; and finally in order to facilitate the development of a knowledge-based society by including everyone in a society founded upon information and communication. Mr Hökmark’s report does contain some good things, for example when it stresses education and providing schools with computer equipment. The fact is – although older members of the public must not be forgotten – that everything starts with the first learning experiences and with access to tools in the places where basic education is provided. I am thinking in particular of such places as universities and training centres, although the development of health services on the Internet is another particularly important line of development, making treatment protocols and individual follow-up procedures easier. Another line of development is the work being done to make government services accessible on line, which makes them approachable, results in time benefits and brings the services available closer to the public. I appreciate the attention that the rapporteur has given to the comments we made and which were primarily aimed at taking practical account of the expectations of our fellow citizens, and in such a way that the technological response would improve their day-to-day lives. We have tackled the broadband issue in the context of the goals of the EU and in accordance with the mandate given to us by Parliament, and this with a view to enabling everyone to have access to broadband and enabling it to play its part in bringing about economic, social and – of course – territorial integration. I do find it regrettable, however, that greater emphasis was not put on regional development and that more research was not done on access for the members of the public who find such access most difficult, such as elderly people and people with disabilities. We need to do everything possible to improve access to the digital culture and to offer content that meets the needs and expectations of all members of the public. However rapid the technology, it is always the way in which it is used that gets the best out of the service. It is a good thing, then, that broadband should be accessible by everyone, but public places – free of charge if possible – are also needed where people can access broadband and familiarise themselves with these technologies. The fact is that ICTs are particular goods that can be considered as resources on the grounds that they perform a real social and cultural role, and we have just heard Commissioner Kroes say that they could be regarded as a service of general interest. I shall hold on not only to the idea, but also to the prospect that she holds out, as installing broadband is a matter of political will and is not just about developing competition.
 Catherine Trautmann,

 Madam President, Commissioner, Mrs Hall, ladies and gentlemen, we are being asked to express an opinion on the reallocation of radio frequencies. This is a very important dossier and the Commission’s reasons for wanting a proposal that seeks to optimise or maximise the benefits of this resource of course stem from changing technologies, the existence of the digital dividend and the desire, clearly expressed in the Lisbon objectives, to give everyone access to new services, be it the Internet, mobile telephony or many others besides. We have just spoken of broadband in particular, which could help to reduce the digital divide from which the European Union suffers, especially in rural and thinly populated areas. We must therefore seek to ensure a rational use of frequencies that will guarantee universal coverage in the 27 countries of the Union with a view to sustainable development of all areas. Frequencies are in fact a resource, a public good, common to us all and strategic for the Union, and we must ensure that the spectrum is used efficiently in the long term. Just as we speak of energy efficiency, I believe we can also speak of radio spectrum efficiency. I would like to welcome the Commission’s attempts to give a new European dimension to the use of this digital dividend and avoid a repetition of the very real problem we had, and which the companies concerned saw as such, when the UMTS networks were put up for sale. It proposes the creation of a market. We have to be able to find a way of providing greater flexibility, avoiding speculation and monopolies and making frequencies accessible to new services and new entrants. I believe it is right to want to do so. We must find new opportunities for innovation there, but we must be careful how they are marketed, whether it be by licences, auctions or assignments, in particular of public or free-access services, even if on a temporary basis. These different approaches remain to be defined. In our committee we had a debate on the place of broadcasters and I would like to say here most emphatically that for my part I have always defended the special nature of the information programmes, the cultural programmes provided by broadcasters, especially public broadcasters, who do not have the private capital necessary to pay for access to the market on the same terms as, let us say, ordinary companies. Therefore, if we are to take account of this situation while being fair and impartial, that is why the Socialist Group has tabled an amendment seeking to take account of radio spectrum efficiency, the balance between respect for public broadcasts and respect for State broadcasts on safety, also the role of regulators and the role of business.

 I would like to congratulate my colleague Mrs Morgan on her own-initiative report on the European strategy for sustainable, competitive and secure energy. This report contains notable advances on the social level, particularly in terms of facilitating access to energy for the poorest citizens, as well as on the environmental level. However, I have abstained from the final vote because I regret the total separation of ownership in the gas sector. Because of the specific features of this strategic sector, I think that a more flexible separation would have made it easier to ensure the security of supply and investments.

Madam President, Mrs Reding, Mrs Hieronymi, the adoption of this amended TVWF (‘Television without Frontiers’) Directive is going to enable the various players to develop within a clear framework, responding to the demands of the digital revolution and of the knowledge-based economy. I would emphasise the positive point concerning the scope of application, with the inclusion of non-linear services and the unambiguous exclusion of private websites. A balance needed to be struck between freedom of expression, the free movement of information and freedom of access to new services – such as VOD – and to valuable cultural and economic content. The emphasis laid on quality will enable European production to strengthen its position. The same is true of the promotion of European content. The directive offers real progress with regard to the protection of minors and places ethical restrictions on advertising, but it must confirm matters, particularly with regard to the issue of health and of the fight against obesity. I hope that our Parliament will confirm its support for my proposal to ban the advertising of products that do not comply with children’s labour standards.

Mr President, in the nick of time, Parliament has pulled the fat out of the fire by adopting the Seventh Framework Programme and avoiding a blank year for European research. It also enables us to respond to that most exciting of challenges, network intelligence. Let me highlight some welcome advances: the adoption of priorities associated with people's everyday lives, such as health, energy, the environment, support for information and communication technology, the impact of which cuts across all the policies of the Union, the increased consideration given to small and medium-sized enterprises, the engine of competitiveness, through the risk-sharing fund, and, lastly, a prospect of future resources that inspires confidence, with the enhancement of the Marie Curie scholarships and the creation of the European Research Council. As the shadow rapporteur for the Ideas
 programme, I am delighted that the European Research Council, which is to function through and for researchers, will represent a new form of scientific governance and will fall within the realm of codecision. The European Parliament has demonstrated unity and responsibility. At the same time, I regret that the budget is not sufficient to make up the leeway on our American and Japanese competitors, who are investing more than twice as much on research as we are. The Council must hear our message in support of yours, Commissioner. The merit of this Framework Programme is that it gives globalisation a human face, and that is surely worth an additional financial effort. Let us fix a date for the revision of the Financial Perspective!

Mr President, in our globalised society, the Internet is a fast and user-friendly means of communicating among individuals or in a group, of buying and selling, of accessing information and of creating material. The Internet has become an open global public space in which everyone is, in principle, free to move around and to express him or herself. The World Summit on the Information Society has placed fundamental human rights at the core of the information society. The fact is, we are not all equal when it comes to freedom of expression on the Internet, and some States have begun to ban citizens, journalists and others from expressing themselves. Worse still, Reporters without Borders has made an alarming finding concerning Internet repression and reports that a very large number of Internet users are being held in prison, particularly in China. Our resolution enables us to take a strong stand against these attacks on people’s freedoms and to condemn the States that carry them out. We call on the Council and the Commission to demonstrate the same rigour in their international relations and their aid and cooperation programmes. Yet, we also want to appeal to the responsibility of businesses, particularly European ones, which, by providing technologies or services, are more or less involved in these acts and which ought to commit themselves to subscribing to a code of conduct preventing them from playing a part in censorship, in repression and in persecution. We cannot advocate freedom of trade while refusing to protect individual freedoms. The Athens Forum on Internet governance, scheduled for November, must enable the European Union to put the recommendations from this resolution into practice.

 Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, our Assembly is getting ready to vote in favour of the Seventh Framework Programme on Research and Development, which will thus be operational no later than by 1 January 2007. We wish to avoid the risk of a lost year for research, so strategically important is this area if we are to compete effectively with the United States, India and China. The gamble has almost paid off, and I warmly congratulate our Commissioner, Mr Potočnik, and our rapporteur, Mr Buzek. Research must help strengthen our unity, thanks to people and territories being integrated into the European Research Area, and at the same time favour an intelligent and lasting development model while also demanding excellence and efficiency. Shall we achieve this, however? Where financial resources are concerned, these are inadequate, even if the budgetary agreement adopted by the Committee on Industry, Research and Energy and proposed in plenary is satisfactory inasmuch as it seeks as best as possible to counter the weakness of the budget obtained within the framework of the Financial Perspective. I should like to reiterate my regrets on this matter and tell the Member States that they absolutely must recognise how important research is for growth and employment and, when the Financial Perspective is revised, prepare to supplement the financial resources allocated to this sector. Where content is concerned, the wording voted in favour of by the Committee on Industry, Research and Energy presents a satisfactory balance, even if I regret that more support was not given to the international cooperation designed to enable development to take place and to stem the brain drain. It is a good thing that the emphasis has been placed on health, sustainable development and energy, as well as on ICTs, to which 40% of our growth is attributable. With regard to structures and the future, I am particularly pleased that the European Research Council will soon be in operation. The ERC, with its 22-member scientific committee, meets the expectations of the research community. It will thus be possible to fund vital basic research in a simple way via this body operated by and for the scientific community. Moreover, individual grants are to be awarded in recognition of excellence and on the basis of criteria defined by the scientists. The Council, which will give the European Union a genuine angle on the future and secure for it the trust of the world of research, will be characterised by independence and transparency. We hope that it will help attract our young generation of graduates to the research professions. The decision not to determine the final form to be taken by the ERC was taken out of a concern to bring the Council into operation no later than by 1 January 2007 and to seek to make it as effective as it possibly can be. That is why our Parliament wishes, within the framework of the codecision process, to be fully involved in taking the decision on the definitive form to be taken by the Council.

Mr President, we are concerned here with the third resolution that we are proposing that the European Parliament adopt on human rights in Tunisia. With the Commission and the Council having followed the same line as our Assembly last September and December, we had a right to hope that Tunisia would respect its European commitments. Nothing of the sort happened, as the ban on holding the Congress of the Tunisian Human Rights League and the recent forceful interventions against human rights activists and legal professionals demonstrate. Just as serious is the way in which the agreement with the European Union on the reform of the judiciary is being misused. This agreement, which was signed in December 2005, was intended to mark real progress in terms of respect for human rights in that country and, above all, to guarantee a genuinely independent status for the judiciary. The only measure taken in connection with the association agreement has therefore been harmed by the fact that the law establishing the lawyers’ training institute was imposed without the opinion of the Bar and placed under the exclusive authority of the executive. Not only have the commitments made by Tunisia not been fulfilled but, furthermore, the expected progress has not been observed. Quite the contrary, the latest events reflect a worsening of the situation and amount to a form of provocation towards the European Union, given that respect for human rights underpins the EU-Tunisia partnership. There is therefore no use in confining oneself to words and hopes. What we expect from the Commission and from the Council are acts, since the pedagogy of dialogue does not seem to be enough. We therefore call for an Association Council to be convened quickly, for the Congress of the Tunisian Human Rights League to be held without any restrictions, for the funds earmarked for civil society to be released and for the acts of intimidation and harassment to stop. Furthermore, we are calling for all of those measures that will be considered appropriate where adopting our resolution is concerned to be accompanied by a precise and fixed timeframe, so that no one can be unaware of the reciprocal commitments that link the European Union and Tunisia.

 The knowledge-based society cannot be achieved unless we can bridge the digital divide in all its forms. There is a digital divide between rich and poor countries, but it also exists within the EU itself. If we are to combat this problem effectively, we need to tackle all of its various aspects, both technological and socio-economic. Indeed, knowledge of ICT is the best response we can give to this problem. The aim of the i2010 strategy is to develop the effective use of the goods and services provided by ICT and to encourage active and critical participation in the information society for all and to everyone's benefit. This plan of action is therefore particularly to be welcomed. The intention of our amendments was to ensure that we do not forget about vulnerable people such as the elderly, the disabled, and those who live alone or have social difficulties. I also think it would be worthwhile to undertake an analysis of the economic, cultural and social effects of the move towards an information society, in order to improve our understanding and the monitoring of the plan, because I believe that we cannot be competitive if we do not share knowledge and skills.

Mr President, Mittal Steel
 has launched a hostile TOB for Arcelor
, threatening nearly 50 000 jobs in Europe. Arcelor
, which was born out of the ECSC, enabled the iron and steel industry to be adapted to the new world order at the cost of unprecedented financial and human efforts, which are liable to be written off as a loss. Although I am concerned about the social consequences in terms of protecting workers and keeping jobs, I also wonder about European industry’s ability to tackle the mergers and transformations resulting from globalisation. Over and above the national positions, however, it is undoubtedly from Europe that the steel workers are awaiting some action. This action will hinge on the implementation of an ambitious European industrial policy endowed with sufficient financial resources and based on a budget priority that is clearly focused on research and development and on innovation. This case shows that, in the EU’s key economic areas, we must provide long-term answers and, more specifically, act as the driving force behind international regulation. European integration began with steel, and this is truly symbolic: it must be possible for European integration to continue without abandoning Arcelor
 and its employees.

 Mr President, I would just like to request a purely formal correction to paragraph 6 of the draft compromise resolution, reinstating the final phrase of the final clause starting ‘in order to’ at the end of the first part, in other words after ‘Association Council’, in order to reproduce the text on which we reached agreement. I would also request that, where the text simply refers to ‘the summit’, we add ‘the WSIS’ in brackets, to be consistent with the rest of the resolution and in order to avoid confusion if isolated paragraphs of the text are quoted. I would like to end by thanking the members of the various groups who were willing to extend the scope of this resolution to the conclusions of the summit. I must stress how important this resolution is now that the Sakharov Prize has been awarded and given that we in this House emphasised yesterday that freedom of expression – a fundamental right – and freedom of the press must be a part of all our activities, particularly when we have agreements with partner countries.

Madam President, finding a balance between the protection of people’s private lives and the retention of personal data in order to respond to the terrorist threat is difficult because the temptation is so strong in our Member States to transform exceptional measures into general rules. The compromise reached with the European Parliament is a positive step, but it should not make us lose sight of the objective of having a directive providing a legal framework and identical guarantees in all countries, for all citizens. I emphasise the recommendations made by the Committee on Industry, Research and Energy in relation to businesses. Businesses must neither become an instrument for governments to monitor their citizens, nor be hindered in their work, and their cooperation must go hand in hand with strict guarantees, not least in relation to the full reimbursement of extra costs. Finally, it is vital that the arrangement be as well adapted as possible to the functioning of the Web and that it hinders neither the development of the Internet nor access to ICTs in the Union. Neither can do without its freedom.

Mr President, as the head of our parliamentary delegation at the World Summit on the Information Society held in Tunis, I should like to testify to the leading role played by the Union in terms of the progress made in the international negotiations. The enhanced cooperation of the Member States has enabled progress to be made with regard not only to the introduction of an Internet Governance Forum, which will meet for the first time in Athens, but also to the democratic balance between the Member States, to pluralism and to the involvement of civil society. Human rights and fundamental freedoms constitute the essential foundations of Internet governance and of the action plan. It is on the basis of the proposals made by the Union and, more specifically, by the Commission, that an agreement was reached in Tunis, not least with the United States. I should like to pay tribute to the Commission’s negotiators and to sincerely thank the Commissioner for having involved the European Parliament in this process. Nevertheless, I regret the fact that the only shadow cast over this Summit should have come from Tunisia itself. The serious incidents that surrounded the Summit and that undermined not only the freedom of the press and freedom of expression and of assembly, but also the people are, in my opinion, unacceptable, as are the events targeted at our delegation including, in particular, the sabotage of the Workshop on Human Rights in relation to Internet governance. They run counter to the commitments made by Tunisia in the Summit conclusions and in the Association Agreement, thus violating the reciprocal character of these commitments. These events call for a swift and firm response from the Union, and I call on my fellow Members to vote in favour of the compromise resolution, which demands that practical measures be taken immediately. I thank the Commissioner for the very precise remarks she made just now along these lines.

 Mr President, Commissioner, I want to congratulate Mrs Toia on the quality of her report and to thank her for working with the shadow rapporteurs and accepting our proposed amendments. I would like to mention some essential points. We need to encourage the creation of a single market in telecommunications covering the entire European territory. Such a single market is necessary in order to reduce the digital divide, which is a priority aim for the European Union. However, this transition to a new framework for the regulation and supply of electronic communications must respect the public and consumers by bringing the transparency and security necessary for the proper use of telecommunications. This means transparency on questions of safety and public health, especially radiation measurement; it also means a correctly regulated market, which is the only way to guarantee fair service and pricing conditions. This concerns international roaming in particular. It is essential that we draw up an action plan, with a timetable, so that consumers can enjoy continuity of service, which means the potential for international roaming throughout European territory, at the best price and at the earliest opportunity. On 7 December, the single Internet address .eu will be launched for businesses. Just as the Commission is giving concrete expression to this long awaited decision, it should also act to bring in a single dialling code with a single tariff for the European Union as a whole. That must be a priority of the action plan, the importance and significance of which I have just pointed out, strengthening a telecommunications area appropriate to the free movement of persons and of personal communications.

Mr President, Commissioner, I too would like to congratulate Mrs Hieronymi on the quality of her report and to thank her for having integrated the greater part of the opinions and comments of the Committee on Industry, Research and Energy. I will therefore get on to the main point. In order to maintain the lever effect that the MEDIA programme is acknowledged as having today in a more intensely competitive market, it is imperative that we continue to make sure that the programme is adaptable, that we continue to meet the expectations of professionals and, furthermore, that we continue to rise to the challenges represented by the arrival and the prodigious development of new formats, such as digital technology, or of new supports, such as mobile telephones. To be still more effective, MEDIA should not therefore just be following technological developments, but anticipating them, if not encouraging them. Thus, complementarity between MEDIA and other related programmes in the area of innovation and research is crucial and still needs to be enhanced. MEDIA 2007 is the first post-enlargement programme. Safeguarding the film productions of the new Member States on its own justifies an increase in European support, with care being taken, in particular, to establish proportionality in favour of these countries. We also have to support the indirect costs linked to the private funding of production projects. Such action would enable a large number of businesses to have increased access to bank loans, as the risks would be reduced. This access to bank loans by SMEs is a crucial factor in the development of a strong audiovisual industry. In this geopolitical and technological context, the budget of EUR 1.055 billion, as proposed by the Commission, is the minimum threshold for seven years and 27 countries. While I welcome the initiatives taken on this matter for encouraging and facilitating national investments, which have become crucial to the success of MEDIA’s forthcoming objectives, I cannot agree to MEDIA being subjected to our whims when we debate the financial perspectives. Those are the conditions that will mean that MEDIA, which has a crucial bearing on the Lisbon objectives being met, can enable one of the most promising sectors in terms of job creation and economic growth to be developed and enhanced.

Mr President, my report deals with the World Summit on the Information Society, a process initiated by the United Nations. The first phase took place in Geneva in 2003 and concluded with the adoption of a declaration of principles and a plan of action. The second phase, which will take place in Tunis this November, will focus on the implementation of the plan and on two unresolved issues, namely financing the plan of action and governance of the Internet. The European Union has engaged in this process with a coordinated position and considerable authority, because it can speak with one voice. If my fellow Members adopt this resolution, our Parliament will underpin the position of the Union and signal its commitment to the success of the process. Information and communication technology, ICT, plays an integral part in the pursuit of the Millennium Goals, which are all about the elimination of poverty. The war on poverty focuses on material necessities but it also involves access to online services, whether these be educational, health-related, administrative or commercial. The rise of the Internet and of mobile telephony has created new potential for development, competitiveness and growth. Europe suffers from four dimensions of the digital divide: geographical, social, economic and cultural. This divide is even deeper in the least-developed countries, or LDCs, which have neither an adequate infrastructure nor the means to provide mass access to these forms of technology. The first issue to emphasise is the contribution of ICT to democracy. It is an essential means of reducing inequality and promoting human dignity as well as of guaranteeing freedom of expression and information, pluralism of opinion and popular involvement in decision-making processes. It is imperative that these human rights be respected in the information society. The concern of the World Summit to ensure that a better regulatory framework, an appropriate system of governance, is created to avert the risks and aberrations that might jeopardise the security and integrity of individuals, organisations and even governments, cannot justify failure to respect these rights. Cultural and linguistic diversity should be one of the driving forces of the progress initiated by the World Summit. Such diversity is easier to achieve in a democratic context, and our Parliament has a duty to point this out to Tunisia, which will be hosting the summit. The second issue is the need for a new form of partnership with the countries of the South. These countries require confidence and the prospect of long-term stability before they can act. Cancelling the debt of the poorest countries is a good thing as long as it does not reduce their access to funding. Merely substituting donations for access to lending facilities would be ineffective. The European Union did not want a new fund to be created at the United Nations for the purpose of encouraging cooperative ventures, since it would entail the mobilisation of the existing funds allocated to our own development programmes, to the framework programme for research and development and to the Competitiveness and Innovation programme. In the same vein, I have suggested that unused development appropriations be allocated to the plan of action. The creation of the Digital Solidarity Fund on a voluntary basis is to be welcomed, but the Fund remains a complementary instrument. The Union should give preference to multipartite initiatives involving national governments, the private sector, local and/or regional authorities and NGOs. People using ICT should be involved as users and players, thereby helping to ensure that ICT-based services promote the quality of life, the development of entrepreneurial activity and the production of content with due respect for local cultures and local know-how. Multipartite ventures are an indicator of confidence and mobilisation. Before our representatives leave for Tunis, incidentally, our Parliament will meet interested parties from civil society in order to establish a durable working relationship. In conclusion, let me say that the key aim is the promotion of fair and sustainable development. This is the essence of our vision of an inclusive information society. It is for this reason that I should like the timetables for the Lisbon and i2010 strategies to be linked to the plan of action and the involvement of the European Union to be considered in terms of shared development and shared responsibility. Our partners, like ourselves, should be assured of a voice in the system of governance and of the preservation of their sovereign decision-making powers. Whether in the field of health care, prevention, environmental risks, waste management or conservation of resources, we are interdependent. European growth is inconceivable without solidarity.

 Mr President, the EU has just celebrated the 60th anniversary of a shared peace at a time when two of the founding countries have just expressed their doubts at the ballot box. Faced with the social effects of globalisation, the moral crisis linked to unemployment and inequality is adding to the democratic crisis, not to mention the budgetary crisis. The final decision on the financial perspectives will be crucial to the credibility and legitimacy of the EU and of its institutions. Two political events are much anticipated. The first is the success of enlargement. It is our duty to reach this stage, in the interests of equality between our countries and our citizens. The contribution recommended by our rapporteur for territorial and social cohesion is necessary, though not adequate: specifically, it lacks increased funding for transport networks. I also support the creation of the growth adjustment fund to help us achieve this objective. The second event is the future: our old industrial continent is in the process of changing and we must level out the territorial, economic and cultural inequalities. It will only be possible to create new products and new services to combine productivity and solidarity if research and innovation are adequately funded. The doubling of the research budget and the objective of 3% of the EU’s GNI by 2010 absolutely must be respected. On these two political conditions, and on the assumption that our ambitions will be funded by their own new resources, I am supporting the reasonable choice of our rapporteur, so that our Parliament can exercise its full authority in the coming negotiations and bring the Council round to its way of thinking.

 Mr President, after nearly 38 years of dictatorship by President Eyadéma and with his son Faure Gnassingbé having seized power in defiance of every constitutional rule and the commitment given in Brussels on 14 April 2004 for a return to political dialogue between all forces, Togo is sinking deeper every day into crisis and the risk of civil war. The Togolese people and Togo nationals living in our European countries are looking to the European Parliament and the European Union to take a firm and resolute stance. They want our solidarity and new prospects for their future and that of their children. This requires first of all a genuine return to popular sovereignty. There are two conditions for that. The first is that Faure Gnassingbé must withdraw immediately and without argument and put an end to this hereditary dictatorship that he sought to install by military coup
 in defiance of democratic principles and the laws of his country and in violation of international law. The second is the restoration of constitutional legality and the resumption of pluralist dialogue involving all parties, including of course the opposition parties. Only Mr Natchaba, the speaker of the National Assembly, would be in a position to provide an interim government to prepare for presidential elections in accordance with the constitution. It will only be possible for Mr Natchaba to return to Togo if his safety can be guaranteed, however. In this connection, Mr President, I want to stress the justified concern expressed in this House yesterday by a representative delegation of associations of democratic movements and human rights associations about the real risks that political activists, human rights activists and journalists are running today. With my colleague, Marie-Arlette Carlotti, we received them and listened to them with the greatest attention, because some of them, or members of their families, have been physically ill treated and abused under the Eyadéma dictatorship. They made an emotional appeal to us and to all international bodies to take definite concerted action to restore democracy permanently to Togo. Knowing that their country, which is already subject to sanctions, has suffered during the last several years, they nevertheless said they expected us to adopt a firm and tough attitude towards Togo if nothing happens to guarantee the holding of free elections. Our resolution responds to that expectation by referring to sanctions, some of which have already been imposed by the Economic Community of West African States, while others are planned by other international bodies. For my part, I want to stress the need for targeted measures to be taken quickly concerning the supply of arms and transfers of money outside Togo. International bodies must also act to give the population the security necessary for future elections to be prepared for in an atmosphere of calm. It is essential that the political parties should be able to conduct a proper election campaign; it is equally essential that all the media do their duty by providing information.

Madam President, Minister, I have a few words to say: the stumbling block that we will encounter when tackling this demographic challenge is that the number of working people is falling. Two figures: in 2010, there will be 217 million people of working age, and in 2050 this figure will be 180 million; a deficit of almost 36 million people. Should we fear a shortage of labour? Should we fear an imbalance between the working population and those who are dependent? We are suggesting two solutions to this problem, which aim to achieve optimal management of human resources. Firstly, full employment. We must work towards full employment. There are currently very significant employment opportunities, given the under-employment among young people, women, over-55s and underqualified individuals. We are witnessing a huge waste of skills. We may well find that if employment levels among women and those aged between 55 and 65 increase, by 2050, to rates similar to the best in Europe, we could make up for this shortage of labour. Finally, lifelong education and training. We would like to work towards an optimal length of working life. It is unacceptable that a worker, a project manager, a 50-year old manager has little more by way of career prospects than stagnation. The social responsibility of our firms is at stake here. (The President cut off the speaker.)

 Mr President, Commissioner, President-in-Office of the Council, ladies and gentlemen, the failure of the fifth MDG affects us all, in that it epitomises our failure to move forward with the emancipation of women all over the world. We agree that it should be made a major political objective because it also lies heavy on our consciences. However, we should also have the courage to say that thousands of women are also the victims of ignorance, neglect and misinformation. Neglect because the majority of the 500 000 cases of maternal mortality could be avoided through prevention and basic healthcare. Distributing impregnated mosquito nets, for example, could prevent fatal cases of malaria for thousands of women. Ignorance, in that all too often, girls and women are still prevented from gaining a basic education, which would simply enable them to read and understand simple health and hygiene recommendations. Lastly, misinformation: a certain conservative idea of religion and tradition, which still keeps women in a state of intolerable dependence, marriage when very young, pregnancies in close succession, and taboos over female contraception. Consequently we are taking action; networks of parliamentary representatives for the developing population, from Europe and Africa, are working together within the UNFPA. We are speaking out in favour of health, reproduction and women’s control over their fertility and, in addition to the necessary financial support for this, we have to change attitudes and the position of women. This is a key political goal for the development of all these countries.

 Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, I would first like to thank the rapporteur for the quality of her report. It has given us the opportunity for a new in-depth debate on trade in services. We have been able to define convergences and identify some points for discussion. We will see whether these constitute serious divergences at the end of the debate and the vote. Whether we are talking about the internal market or external trade, we agree on the fact that the services market accounts for the largest share in the creation of wealth and a quarter of world trade. It is indeed possible that this economic sector still has growth potential for the European Union. It is therefore legitimate to include the services market in bilateral and multilateral trade negotiations. However, we will have to define the principles and terms of the market for trade in services. The first point my group wishes to highlight is that a distinction must be made between the services market and the goods market. Services are not like goods, for a number of reasons. Firstly, services are not of the same nature; some are linked to fundamental needs and rights. We very much believe in the need to make a distinction between commercial and non-commercial services, whether in healthcare or education. Vital services such as water and energy must also be thought of as having a special status. Services are not like goods because trade in them often very directly involves human endeavour and not just the virtual trading of a technology. Although they potentially create jobs, they are also the sector in which we find the most informal employment and the greatest precarity. I am therefore delighted that the report states that the rules of trade must respect the employment standards drawn up by the ILO. In our development goals we must also fight against precarity and poverty. Finally, we have not lost sight of the Doha objectives and international trade as a vector of development. This notion commits us to taking account of the differing interests of the Member States and developing countries when negotiating commitment schedules and economic partnership agreements. The European Union must take account of the stages of development, pace and wishes of countries when opening up services markets, particularly when liberalising some of their services. I am thinking particularly of financial services. Exerting pressure on third countries over their way of conceiving of and regulating their services is out of the question. The sovereignty of these countries must be respected when it comes to issues as sensitive as public services and financial services. I do not know if we will reach a total consensus on this question. It is possible that this is a subject that divides right from left in this Parliament.

 Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, the debate we are continuing this evening began within these walls several years ago. It will not end with the adoption of this report, which still leaves some questions unanswered, and which we will undoubtedly have to come back to in the near future. In any case, I would like to thank the Commission for the quality of its communication, which has enriched the debate, and we have benefited from it in the Committee on Employment and Social Affairs. In my report, I develop the consequences of demographic change, i.e. the shrinking of the active population, the growing number of elderly people, and the demographic imbalances between different regions of Europe. Is this to say it is impossible to act on the causes? I would first like to remind you that the 20th century saw two vast changes. Firstly, women gained access to education and training on the same footing as men. Secondly, women gained control over their reproductive lives through contraception. These are two factors of women’s emancipation. They mark great, and I hope irreversible, progress for humanity. However, to have all the information for analysis at hand, two other things need to be added as well. All the studies show that European citizens would like more children than they actually have, and secondly, in Member States where the employment rate among women is high, the birth rate is also high. An active working life therefore does not prevent people from having children, provided that there is reconciliation of work life and family life for everyone, men and women alike. There is still a lot of progress to be made in this area, in all Member States. Another point arose during our discussions, one that nobody essentially disputes. Economic insecurity and fear of the future are important factors behind the drop in the birth rate. When it is difficult to plan for the future, people hesitate to have children. This is a key point, and I think that the drop in birth rate recorded in the European Union is a serious warning from this point of view. To regain confidence in the future, our citizens need their job security and dignified living conditions restored. Enough of the causes, what about the consequences? The main consequence is a reduction in the active population, falling from 331 million in 2010 to around 268 million by 2050. How can we maintain Europe’s growth and competitiveness with a tiny active population? This is where the title of the communication takes on real meaning, Commissioner, and real force: turning a challenge into an opportunity. Europe still has some very high unemployment rates today, and the margin for progress in the employment of women, young people and older people, for whom the employment rate drops dramatically from the age of 52-55 years, remains great. Is not the real opportunity of this demographic challenge, the objective of full employment, which is finally realistic, finally achievable and finally necessary? To achieve it we must implement a genuine human resources management policy and a real lifelong training policy. I say lifelong with reason, for that also means for employees over 50 who, along with other types of discrimination, also have to face discrimination on training and on promotion at work. In my report, I put forward the concept of the active life-cycle to stress the need to consider a period of active life of around forty years – though it is up to the Member States to decide – of continuous employment, training, requalification, potential promotion, from the beginning to the end of a person’s active life. Before considering raising the retirement age, it is necessary to make sure that everyone below that age is able to work, to exploit their skills and professional experience. It is because there is a legal retirement age that people can think of going beyond it, depending on the arrangements defined by each Member State in line with its traditions of dialogue and consultation. On this point, the debate remains open. The last point I would like to mention quickly is of course the use of immigration. There is much discussion of it making up for the drop in the active population, but immigration also stirs up a great deal of tension, as you know. For this reason I recommend a clear and reasoned approach to this issue. Immigration is not a new phenomenon in the European Union and, with a positive balance of two million immigrants per year – a figure that has been stable for several years – legal immigration contributes to the composition of the active population of the European Union, just as it contributes to the composition of European society. We need to maintain this flow of immigrants and guarantee a legal status in our Member States for those we welcome, in particular fighting illegal immigration and the exploitation of illegal workers. The human dimension of immigration must govern our policies on the subject and family integration should not disappear from our guidelines. In a provisional conclusion to this presentation, I would like to recall that, behind the average birth rates, the age pyramids and the ratios lie the issues of birth, motherhood, the place of women in society, the care we give to our elderly and the way we ourselves wish to end our lives. That is the reason why this debate is as interesting as it is impassioned, and I would also like to thank all the shadow rapporteurs for taking as much interest in this as I have.
 Françoise Castex,  
rapporteur. − (FR)
 Mr President, I will be brief because many things have been said. I would like to thank Mr Špidla for having pointed out that the issue of demographics is not an issue about women only, and that it concerns women, men and couples. I would like to point out, for my fellow Members who made the criticism that men had been forgotten, that I devoted a paragraph in my report to the issue of promoting paternity law and developing the involvement of fathers in family life. Anyway, to try to round up a bit what was said and sum up the main thrust of the report, I would like to highlight the strong demand that exists for effective public policies. These are policies, in the plural, concerning support, care and education, which might seem slightly paradoxical for an issue that in fact relates to the intimacy of couples and the family. However, I believe that an appeal is being made to the public authorities at European level, and in the Member States, that needs to be heard and must be taken on board. I would also like to underline this issue of strong demand for solidarity, not only solidarity between the generations, which we have dealt with several times in this House, but solidarity between different regions. Mrs Schroedter and Mr Beaupuy highlighted and recalled this evening how important it is to take account of the regional imbalances the demographic issue will cause between ageing regions that demand more care and therefore more expenditure, and younger regions that will be creating wealth, because that is where the productive population will be. This is something the European Commission has to take into account in managing the EU Structural Funds and Cohesion Funds. Finally, the issue of the job market, as Mr Andersson, Chairman of the Committee on Employment and Social Affairs, mentioned, is an important issue in the demographic question. It is not peripheral, because it will be necessary to do more with a smaller, shrunken active population. From this point of view, the calls for better management of human resources, for investment in lifelong education and training are extremely important, and they must be heeded not only by the public authorities in these particular cases, but by all the social partners, particularly companies, because they have a major responsibility in this area. This debate is therefore not yet over.

Mrs Castex voted for the Susta report on the Protocol amending the Agreement on Trade-Related Aspects of Intellectual Property Rights (TRIPS Agreement). For French Members of the Socialist Group in the European Parliament, the agreement hereby obtained, which will allow countries to produce generic drugs and export them to poor developing nations with no capability of producing these medicines themselves, constitutes an important step forwards. For French Members of the Socialist Group, this report makes a positive contribution to resolving a public health problem that is clearly a matter of serious concern.

Mrs Castex voted for the Mantovani report on the establishment of a European Qualifications Framework. This French Member of the Socialist Group in the European Parliament welcomes the future introduction of the European Qualifications Framework, which will facilitate transnational mobility for workers and learners, while at the same time meeting the requirements of the labour market by way of a common reference point for the transposition of qualification levels. According to the proposal all qualifications, from the end of compulsory education to the highest levels of university teaching and professional training (the Commission’s initial document only concerned general educational qualifications), should be classified according to one of eight reference levels based on knowledge, ability and acquired skills. Mrs Castex believes that the EQF, as a tool for comparing, translating and converting the qualifications of one Member State to those of another, will respect the diversity of the certification systems and the richness of the qualifications that exist in the European Union. It is a tool that will also facilitate greater mobility for the citizens of Europe. It is now up to the Member States to set about the massive task of classifying the reference levels required for the EQF, otherwise the European Qualifications Framework will be destined to remain an empty shell.

Mrs Castex voted for the Davies report on the reduction of CO2
 emissions from passenger cars and light-commercial vehicles. While France continues to be monopolised by the Grenelle Environment Forum, the European Union has in turn added another valuable building block to the quality of our environment by adopting a strategy to reduce CO2
 emissions from private vehicles. Mrs Castex is very pleased that Parliament has called on the European automotive industry to ensure that new vehicles do not emit more than 120 g/km of CO2 
by 2012. This French Member of the Socialist Group in the European Parliament welcomes the Carbon Allowance Reductions System (CARS), as this mechanism will impose financial penalties on manufacturers who fail to meet their quotas, while at the same time issuing credits to those who have taken the initiative by achieving emissions that are below the limit value curve.

 Mr President, first I would like to thank and congratulate the rapporteur for his excellent consultation on this recommendation on the European Qualifications Framework. I would also like to thank the Commission and the Council for listening and being available to everyone. In the EQF we have a tool that serves the mobility of European citizens, whether as part of training pathways or as part of professional mobility. Free movement of persons, which is written into our Treaties, is still hindered by citizens’ difficulties in having the qualifications obtained in their country of origin recognised throughout the EU. These qualifications, which are awarded by each Member States, according to its own procedures and systems, come under the sovereignty of each Member State and the EQF respects this. However, qualifications increasingly need to be used outside the country in which they were awarded, something we wish to encourage out of respect for the value that the diploma or other qualification gives to its holder. We therefore need a tool for comparing and especially for converting qualifications from one Member State to another. This is a particularly necessary and sensitive issue for professional qualifications. That is why the Committee on Employment and Social Affairs was keen to incorporate professional qualifications into the EQF. This has been done and we are glad. Employees and companies are increasingly mobile in the European job market. However, employees and employers therefore need guarantees, in all Member States, concerning those things that measure the competence and value of a worker, namely their professional qualifications, regardless of how they were acquired. Commissioner, I would, however, like to underline one other point. At the moment the EQF is a nice but empty shell. For it to exist properly, the diplomas, qualifications and certifications created in each Member State need to be calibrated and registered against references in the European Qualifications Framework. This will constitute a large amount of work for all the Member States, and will require a lot of energy and specialist expertise. The European Commission’s support will be essential, as will that of the European agencies – I am thinking in particular of Cedefop. The participation of the social partners will also be essential, at all levels. They must be involved, as the recommendation states, by the Member States and the sectoral dialogue committees at Community level. Finally, for the EQF to be complete and effective, it will also be necessary for the economic partners, the professional branches, to understand and appropriate it for themselves. This is not only because they award the qualifications that should be included in the EQF, but because companies need benchmarks for classifying their jobs and for recruiting. The EQF rapidly needs to become their common reference framework and I dream of an appropriate deadline by which the EQF will be the reference framework everywhere, even in collective agreements.

I voted for the Chatzimarkakis report, which seeks to improve the CAP’s budgetary execution and transparency, in other words to identify the beneficiaries of aid for agriculture. I feel the legitimacy of the CAP, one of the largest items of EU expenditure, is all too often called into question by the opacity with which agricultural aid is managed. The merit of this report is that it clarifies the situation. I am most satisfied by the Internet postings of all the national lists of direct beneficiaries of EU aid, and the links to be set up between the web pages of the Commission and the Member State payment bodies. Monitoring of CAP financing, however, must be carried out in strict compliance with the regulations governing data protection. That is why I voted against the amendments requiring the registration or recording of users consulting the data, since transparency must be guaranteed on both sides. I also believe that the data on the payments of the European Agricultural Fund for Rural Development ought to be broken down in order to identify the major beneficiaries.

I voted for the Lamassoure report on the distribution of EP seats after the legislative elections in 2009. The new distribution balances out the number of seats in accordance with population trends in the Member States. I am glad that France has two more MEPs than those envisaged by the revised Treaty of Nice. I also support the idea that the new distribution ought to be reviewed well in advance of the 2014-2019 parliamentary term in order to ensure a fair and objective system for the distribution of seats in Parliament, taking account of population changes, which would prevent the usual log-rolling between Member States.

I voted for the resolution on the humanitarian situation in Gaza. I am concerned by the deterioration of health indicators in Palestine and aware of the difficulties posed by closure of border control posts, thereby curtailing economic activity and free circulation of goods, and I request that emergency and humanitarian aid be allowed to continue unhindered. I condemn the increasingly difficult living conditions that are rife in Gaza: the blockade preventing the movement of people and goods, partial privatisation of access to water, food and electricity, destruction of agricultural land, and basic services such as refuse collection that no longer operate properly and are on the point of collapse. I feel it is urgent for human rights to be fully respected in Gaza, and I wish to call for an international peace conference to be organised to usher in a fair and lasting peace between the Israelis and the Palestinians; a peace based on the relevant UN Security Council Resolutions concerning the Israelis’ right to live within secure recognised borders and the Palestinians’ right to a viable state.

I believe that geographical and occupational mobility is a crucial instrument for the success of the Revised Lisbon Strategy.

 In my opinion, the problems associated with alcohol abuse are taking on worrying proportions in all EU Member States. Beyond the traditional convivial consumption of alcohol, which varies from region to region and Member State to Member State, it is necessary to remember that regular, excessive consumption of alcohol has a harmful impact on health and serious, direct consequences: road accidents and antisocial behaviour. Consequently, as a matter of urgency we need to remind alcohol producers and distributors of their responsibilities, to ask operators in the sector to provide the necessary support, to involve schools and families, to send out a message providing young people with positive examples and to increase awareness of risks among the more vulnerable sections of society.

In voting for the resolution on the natural disasters that have occurred this summer, I wanted to express my solidarity with the families of the victims and those living in the devastated regions. This is also a message of thanks to all the professionals, volunteers and local authorities that helped to fight the fires and rescue the flood victims. I believe that there is now an urgent need to put emergency Community aid measures, especially financial measures, in place to help regenerate the regions where there has been severe damage. We also need to restore the productive potential of the areas affected, try to encourage the creation of more jobs and take appropriate steps to offset the social costs arising from the loss of jobs and other sources of revenue. I am still concerned at the increasing number of disasters caused by extreme weather conditions, which experts believe are largely due to the climate change that is causing global warming. I therefore urge the Commission to take steps to guarantee compliance with the Kyoto commitments and their repercussions.

I voted against the report on the Single Market Review: tackling barriers and inefficiencies through better implementation and enforcement. I do not agree with the approach by the rapporteur, Mr Toubon, in which opening up to competition in the Single Market would not be subject to any limits or social regulation. I also voted against the further liberalisation of the postal service advocated in the report and I am sorry that the amendments on social and fiscal harmonisation were rejected. Furthermore, I deplore the new reference to the introduction of an unrestricted transatlantic single market and stress that priority should be given to safeguarding and promoting the European social model. In my opinion, completion of the Single Market should be regulated by guarantees of social protection for the citizens of Europe, which is not proposed in the Toubon report, the only European Parliament contribution to the Single Market Review.

Practical measures – in the form of paying back all taxes, partially lifting the 500 barriers in the West Bank and opening up the crossings in the Gaza Strip to international aid – must be taken in order to improve the living conditions of all Palestinians. As a French member of the Socialist Group in the European Parliament, I would urge the European Parliament and the international community to do all they can to ensure that humanitarian aid and emergency aid reach the people of Gaza. Finally, I would like to call for the resumption of internal political dialogue among the Palestinians, dialogue that must aim at the formation of a new government in a spirit of reconciliation and national unity in order to prevent the geographical and political division of the West Bank and Gaza.

I voted in favour of the resolution on the TRIPS Agreement and access to medicines. I believe that access to pharmaceutical products at affordable prices in poor developing countries and in the least developed countries is an essential condition when it comes to formalising the development objectives proposed by the European Union. In my view, the provision of these medicines would help to reduce poverty, to increase human security and to promote human rights and sustainable development. Accordingly, European Union policy should aim at making the maximum amount of affordable pharmaceutical products available within developing countries. Finally, I would like to call on the Council to support developing countries that resort to the flexibilities integrated into the TRIPS Agreement and recognised by the Doha Declaration, so that they are able to provide essential medicines at affordable prices as part of their national public health programmes.

I voted against the liberalisation of postal services. Furthermore, I supported the request to reject this directive on the grounds that the motivations for this proposal are contradictory and unachievable in terms of guaranteeing the universality of the service, the funding methods of which do not safeguard the right for all European citizens to have their post collected and dispatched on a daily basis. What is more, I believe that setting, in principle, a deadline for the expiry of Directive 97/67 does not fit in with the results of the consultation of the social actors concerned and of the Member States. They have indicated the need to maintain the guarantees of the universal service in a uniform, proportional and fair way. As far as I am concerned, this proposal offers no guarantees when it comes to dealing seriously with the social aspects of this liberalisation in order to prevent competition on the job market and social dumping.

I believe that it would be a good idea if, in the Member States in which the Directive is implemented by means of collective agreements, the social partners could directly access information on companies posting workers so as to be able to monitor the situation effectively. Finally, I call on the Member States to think about a future review of their legislation on definitions and instruments, so that they can combat ‘PO Box’ companies and bogus self-employment.

I regret the adoption of ownership unbundling defended by the fierce defenders of the dismantling of large companies. In my opinion, the liberal right has struck another blow to the principle of public service mission, which is so dear to European citizens. I think that ownership unbundling brings no guarantee in relation to investments, safety or third party access (including renewable energy sources, which could be penalised because of their high costs). Nor does it ensure availability of energy at the best price for citizens. I believe it would have been preferable to retain a system like the French one, which integrates into its working the legislative rules from previous European directives.

Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, it was time, I think, that the European Union took up this debate and we can be pleased with the initiative of the Green Paper. Nonetheless, I fear that this initiative is not necessarily good news for European workers. The Green Paper is to be criticised as much for the method adopted as for the guidelines that it proposes. First of all, concerning the method: I deplore that this consultation does not conform to the procedure laid down in Article 138 of the Treaty, which gives a particular status to the social partners when it is a matter of social policy. This derogation from the procedure is moreover denounced by the European Trade Union Confederation. Next, the subject matter: a Green Paper must be impartial. It has to ask questions without giving answers a priori
. The European Commission, however, makes claims that are patently ideological. That is the case when it criticises the traditional model for creating an obstacle to employment. It is the case again when it states that protection against redundancy is an obstacle to the dynamism of enterprises and lists work insecurity as evidence of modernity. There exists in Europe and in international law enacted by the International Labour Organisation (ILO) principles and fundamental rights which must be respected. The open-ended contract must be confirmed as being the rule. The employee must be protected by legislation or collective bargaining or both. That is why, and I insist, collective bargaining must remain the major source for working out labour law. A word, finally, on the concept of flexicurity, set up as a principle. As defined here, it introduces a major imbalance in the distribution of competences between the European Union and the Member States. The European Union would impose flexibility and would leave to Member States alone the responsibility for ensuring the security of employees. Our fellow citizens want a Europe that protects their rights and their social model. Let us not give them the image of a Europe that destroys their social acquis

I abstained during the final vote on the Barón-Brok report on the roadmap for the Union’s constitutional process. Indeed, the rejection of the European Constitutional Treaty by two Member States in fact nullifies the proposal submitted for ratification by the Member States in 2005. This established fact must therefore be taken into account by the Heads of State or Government who cannot keep the initial text even ‘in a different format’. Equally, the process of drafting a new treaty must not take place at the expense of European democracy by means of a mere intergovernmental conference.

I voted in favour of the Vergnaud report. The vote on this report in plenary has confirmed the specific nature of health services and hence their exclusion from the Services Directive. This vote has meant that equal access to health care and the financial viability of social security system will not be called into question. In my view, the discussions begun at Community level on health services must henceforth focus on the legal uncertainty resulting from the case-law of the CJEC and on the areas for which the European Union is liable to create added value. As far as I am concerned, a directive on health services that is in keeping with the goal of a framework directive on services of general economic interest remains the only tool that will enable the European Union to provide its added value and to regain the trust of the people of Europe in an area that is the very essence of their lives.

I voted in favour of the report on promoting decent work for all. The notion of ‘decent work’ seems to be a reference to the terms of multilateral declarations and agreements, but policies, for their part, are still far removed from the concept. Presentations and declarations are one thing; the everyday political actions and decisions of international institutions are quite something else. Indeed, the world is marked by a ‘deficit’ in decent work: in many unproductive and low-quality jobs that involve dangerous work for a precarious income, rights are flouted and inequality between the sexes prevails. Faced with this situation, the WTO and the ILO have adopted international labour standards. However, the IMF and the World Bank do not support any initiatives designed to ensure that the fundamental rights of workers are respected. If decent work is to become a reality worldwide, priority must be given to it by all the international institutions, which will have to work together to make this happen. Decent work must be a universal objective for all the international institutions. It is imperative that these fundamentals – quality employment, workers’ rights, protection and social dialogue – determine all economic and social policies at international level.

I voted in favour of the motion that the Aubert report on organic production and labelling of organic products be referred back to the Committee on Agriculture and Rural Development. As far as I am concerned, it is necessary that the threshold for accidental contamination by GMOs should not be the same as in conventional agriculture, that is to say around 0.9%, for one would thereby be making the de facto admission that contamination can no longer be prevented and that it cannot be guaranteed that a product is GMO-free even if certified ‘organic’. I supported the proposal in this regard from the Socialist Group in the European Parliament, according to which the presence of GMOs in organic products would have to be limited solely to unforeseeable and technically unavoidable amounts to a maximum of 0.1% and that the term ‘organic’ was not to be used to describe products contaminated accidentally by GMOs in excess of a detectable threshold of 0.1%. Finally, I endorse the motion that a different legal basis be found for this matter relating to organic farming. Having hitherto been a consultant, the European Parliament intends to become a codecider where problems such as this are concerned, and that will constitute progress.

This report commits the European Union and its trade partners to the path towards triumphant liberalism, liberalism that goes against the tenets of European trade policy. I regret that the MEPs are renouncing what they have defended until now: a trade policy that consisted in subordinating the trade agreements to social and environmental requirements by respecting the sovereignty of developing countries when it came to the management of a number of sectors vital to their development (public services, investment, public contracts and competition rules). This vote has replaced this policy with a strategy aimed at the wide-ranging liberalisation of services and of investment in developing countries, one that will meet the expectations of European manufacturers, to the detriment of economic development needs. The principle of free trade must be a tool used to promote development, not an objective in its own right. I deplore the fact that the Singapore issues, which had been excluded from the Doha multilateral negotiations, have been re-introduced by the MEPs in this report as priorities for future bilateral negotiations.

The lack of decent affordable housing directly influences the lives of the citizens, restricting as it does their ability to integrate into society, as well as their choices in terms of education, training and professional development. In my view, housing problems are not limited to construction- and land management-related issues proper. They are also greatly influenced by poor urban planning, which results in some neighbourhoods that are affected by environmental damage – air and water pollution, noise, waste, congestion, etc. – and by problems when it comes to public services, accessibility and security becoming less and less attractive and sinking into impoverishment. Faced with problems of poor housing, it is local authorities that are more often than not on the front line. However, this power is still not sufficiently taken into account at European level. The local and European levels must therefore begin to cooperate in practice. As a French member of the Socialist Group in the European Parliament, it is crucial to me that all Europeans have good access to social services, health care and training, as well as to trade and to public administration. It is their right.

At a time when labour law is the subject of debate in the European Parliament, and 13 years after the adoption of the Directive on European Works Councils, the adoption of this resolution constitutes an essential precondition. As a French member of the Socialist Group in the European Parliament, there is an urgent need, in my view, to put an end to the inconsistencies and contradictions between the various European texts relating to information and consultation of workers, in order to prevent abuses by dishonest companies. If employees are no longer to be held hostage by rampant restructuring projects, they must be allowed genuinely to make their presence felt in the decision-making process within the management boards of companies. Companies must be made to act responsibly and to apply the existing directives, or be punished.

 I voted in favour of the Lamassoure report on the future of the European Union's own resources. The effect of the present system is to make the EU’s Budget too dependent on what the nation states want, and I endorse the rapporteur’s analysis according to which this system has, over the course of time, become too complex and, above all, unsuited to meeting the new challenges facing the EU, thus making necessary a return to a proper system for own resources as provided for in the EU’s founding treaties. I welcome the proposal for the abolition, as a first step to this end, of all forms of rebate and compensation awarded to the Member States and for the direct funding of the EU Budget by the temporary use of a tax already in place in the Member States, which would be the best way of ensuring that the EU is funded in a viable way that is also acceptable to the national parliaments. I did, however, vote against the resolution’s paragraph 25, which was rejected by a narrow majority. Although I do not in fact want to reopen a debate on the creation of a new system of finance, I am opposed to the idea that one should consider setting in motion, in the EU-15, a process of mandatory cofinancing of the CAP, which would end up returning the premier common European policy to the national level.

I believe that the proposal to extend the role of the European Aviation Safety Agency (EASA) with the aim of establishing common rules on civil aviation to be applied by all airlines operating in Europe, whether or not they are based in the European Union, is a step forward. Europeans are very concerned today to see rules guaranteeing their maximum security being complied with. In this respect, EASA has been granted powers to impose fines and periodic financial penalties when security rules are not applied properly. Furthermore, I supported the proposals designed to extend the European Aviation Safety Agency’s sphere of competence over pilots’ licences, enabling it to check that pilots fulfil criteria in relation to training and vocational and linguistic skills.

Although gender equality is a value proclaimed by the European Union, there is still some way to go, for example regarding equal pay. In this regard, I endorse the rapporteur’s proposals aimed at requesting the application of the equal pay principle so that the 15% gap between the pay awarded to a man and to a woman doing the same job is no longer the rule. I welcome the implementation of practical strategies aimed at promoting female entrepreneurship. Furthermore, I am delighted by the proposal in the report that calls on the Commission to speed up the creation of policies aimed at reconciling family and professional life, not least by actively encouraging fathers to make use of available flexible working time options and to take on household chores and family work.

 This report has gone completely against the Commission’s proposals on the reform of the common organisation of the market in wine and has made that organisation more respectful of the European wine tradition. Speaking as a Socialist MEP, I feel that this report has struck the right balance in terms of the need to reform the sector and the interests of European winemakers. Firstly, I welcome the implementation of structural measures aimed at restoring the balance of the market. From now on, the cleaning up of the market will entail the gradual elimination of distillation arrangements and a targeted approach to grubbing up according to qualitative, geographical and environmental criteria. Secondly, I welcome the implementation of regulatory measures on oenological practices, labelling – in order to meet the demand for transparency for the consumers – and the promotion of European wine in order to penetrate new markets around the world. Lastly, as I am keen to protect traditional wine production in the face of wine subject to very little regulation, I welcome the ban on must imports.

Although the legal framework for women’s rights appears to be generally satisfactory, its actual implementation is still deficient, in my opinion: violence against women - and, in particular, honour crimes and forced marriages – must be systematically condemned. I welcome the proposal in the report inviting Turkish institutions to build alliances with all groupings – civil and social – in society so as to initiate campaigns to spread awareness of violence committed against women and children. I am also delighted by the adoption of the recommendation addressed to the Turkish political parties to include more female candidates on election lists as from the next elections in 2007.

 Madam President, Commissioner, European winegrowing needs an ambitious reform. As you will have gathered, we want that reform to respect the European winegrowing tradition and to respect the men and women who work in that sector. I would however like to draw your attention to the opinion of the Committee on International Trade, which is included in Mrs Batzeli’s report. The reform of the common organisation of the market in wine must in fact take account of the commercial stakes. Europe remains the world’s largest exporter of wine and while it is necessary to make it more competitive in the face of growing competition from New World wines, the vitality of this sector’s exports rests above all on a quality and authenticity that are acknowledged the world over. We therefore need an offensive commercial policy to promote the quality of European wines. It would therefore be absurd, and counterproductive, for example, to authorise the vinification of imported must and the blending of European wines with wines from elsewhere. The European Parliament’s report is therefore strongly against that. Likewise, it is necessary to secure better protection of protected geographical indications (PGI) and protected designations of origin (PDO) within the framework of the WTO negotiations and bilateral agreements. We want to defend wine production linked to local areas against wines that are largely unregulated. I hope, Commissioner, that the European Commission will respect the opinions which appear in Mrs Batzeli’s report, and I pay tribute to her and congratulate her this evening.

 Mr President, on 22 June 2006 the Commission presented a communication in response to the crisis of overproduction in the European winegrowing sector, recommending the grubbing-up of 400 000 hectares of vines in the next five years, that is, almost 12% of the European Union’s 3.4 million hectares. I want to draw your attention today to the existence of illegal vine plantations in Europe, which are thought to cover an area of 150 000 hectares in the European Union as a whole. According to the Commission’s own figures in a March 2004 report, these illegal vine plantations are equivalent to an output of 5 to 8 million hectolitres at a time when European overproduction is put at 12 million hectolitres. The permanent grubbing-up of these illegal vines would allow a measure of balance to be restored. Before any decision on grubbing-up is taken, I therefore call on the Commission to determine the precise scale of these illegal plantations.

I voted in favour of the Gomes report on women in international politics. The political desire demonstrated at the Beijing Summit in 1995 and the existing international conventions have indeed helped to make the public and decision-makers aware of the issue of equality at every level of society. Nevertheless, these declarations have not had the practical effect of eliminating the non-legal obstacles that continue to prevent women from playing a full part in public life. The Member States need to adopt measures aimed at reconciling social, professional and family life, in line with the conclusions of the Barcelona European Council and of the Lisbon Strategy. I support the creation of a European Institute for Gender Equality aimed at boosting the low numbers of women in politics and at promoting greater female representation in international politics. It is therefore a matter of urgency to open up new channels that will allow women to become more involved in peace and security issues, particularly through more equal nominations at the United Nations or within the external delegations of the European Union.

I voted in favour of the motion to reject the Council common position on services in the internal market. The vote at second reading was cast on a backwards-looking text in comparison with the vote at first reading. There remain too many uncertainties regarding the application of the country of origin principle. The text in no way clarifies the ambiguities that remain concerning the protection of public services and consumers. Even more serious is the fact that, even though labour law comes under national powers, the Council has just subordinated respect for labour law to Community decisions, insofar as respect for labour law will now be subject to the judgments of the European Court of Justice. The European Union is turning its back here on its initial ambition to create a united European area. With the downwards harmonisation of social, environmental and consumer protection rules, the European social model has been jeopardised.

 Mr President, an unprecedented power cut hit Western Europe on the night of 4/5 November. It revealed the fragility of the European energy system and the inadequate capacity for producing and transporting electricity, the result of a poor investment policy. Despite the risk of blackouts, for the last six years European operators have been reducing the level of their investments, which has fallen from 16% to 10% of their turnover. At the same time, electricity consumption has continued to rise by 1.8% per year. This fall in investments is the direct consequence of liberalising the energy market. Rather than investing in the development of new production capacity, operators are concentrating their efforts on profits and on buying out their competitors. On the one hand, the public has seen electricity prices soar while, on the other hand, security has decreased. Only a European energy policy could guarantee successful cooperation between Member States and the implementation of necessary investments to the tune of EUR 700 billion between now and 2030. Electricity is a public good: this should be reflected in the European Union’s political initiatives.

Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, we must acknowledge the fact that a European labour market does genuinely exist, especially in the field of services which, more than any other field, involves the posting of workers. We are in favour of this, but not under just any circumstances and not at the risk of social dumping. Human labour is not a commodity and cannot be subjected to the rules of free competition. We voiced this concern during the debate on the ‘Services’ Directive, and – as you pointed out – Parliament rejected Articles 24 and 25 of this directive, which deal precisely with the easing of the conditions on the posting of workers. The fact is that it is unacceptable for the Commission to undermine this position and to ignore the criticisms voiced by Parliament. The Directive on the posting of workers has been poorly applied in the Member States and is not meeting its objectives. That may be the case, but should the legislation be relaxed as a consequence or, on the contrary, should more be done to encourage the Member States to apply it? I do not believe that the obligations for declarations and effective controls and the retention of documents lead to pointless red tape when what is at stake is the protection of the social rights of posted or local workers. A lax attitude on the matter only benefits fraudsters. Furthermore, enhanced restrictions and the very threat of financial penalties should act as a deterrent. That is why I endorse this report and urgently call on the Commission and the Member States to overcome the difficulties in applying the directive, which we do not want to have amended at this stage.

Madam President, Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, you have emphasised, Mr President, that every country of the Union has its own history and its own conception of public services. The construction of Europe should indeed be undertaken with due deference to this diversity but should also be rooted in a set of common values centred on social justice, equality and solidarity. We can formulate a framework for a European public service. Such a service cannot be defined from the perspective of competition, for we know that the benefits derived by society from public services are measured in terms of education, health, security and cohesion among Member States and among their peoples. As has been mentioned, we shall shortly adopt a directive opening up the market in services within the Community. We are familiar with the issues relating to the market in services at the WTO negotiations. In the Community, as at the global level, it is imperative that we should be able to draw a legal distinction between commercial and non-commercial services and to establish freedom to provide the former and rules to regulate the latter. Is it right that health, education, social housing and even water supply should be subject only to the law of profitability? Of course not! There is but one valid imperative – that of the general public interest and social progress for everyone. And the public authority, at whatever tier of government, is the sole guarantor of that general interest. The people of our countries rightly fear that the European project is being eroded by liberalisation and globalisation. We must meet their needs for quality, accessibility, social responsibility and respect for the environment. What better guarantee can we offer to our concerned fellow citizens, Mr President of the Commission, than a European legal framework for public services?

Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, with the European Qualifications Framework, the Union is providing itself with a tool that can certainly be improved, but that is key to developing mobility within the European Union. The mobility of businesses and European citizens actually opens up a new labour market at Community level. For all European employees, be they engineers, technicians or manual workers, professional qualifications are the only genuine guarantee of their value in the labour market, both at national and at Community level. Just as the single currency, the euro, is a shared value in terms of guaranteeing that the economy is flexible and integrated into the Community, we need a shared value for professional qualifications that is recognised on the European labour market. Businesses and employees both need the shared value of professional qualifications to be recognised. For businesses, qualifications guarantee an employee’s level of competence and his or her suitability for the role; for an employee, they guarantee and promote this level of competence wherever he or she is within the European Union. Whatever our national traditions may be, certification always confirms a person’s ability to do a job and to use the skills necessary to that end. That ability is the fruit of knowledge acquired, either through training or through work experience. I should like to emphasise how progress has been made in some of our Member States in terms of validating acquired experience, which, as has been said, complements training. In the long term, the European Qualifications Framework will have to integrate this process and be open to all forms of recognition. The next stage will have to consist in making the social partners aware of, and involved in, this process straight away so as to ensure that the EQF is taken into account in the agreements and collective agreements and so as to combine a genuine social guarantee with the flexibility of the labour market. The value truly placed in employment, Mr President, can be seen in employment contracts and pay slips.

Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I too would like to begin by congratulating the two rapporteurs on their work. With this report, supported by the Committee on Employment and Social Affairs – I want to emphasise this – we make a great step towards the definition of a European social model: a balanced combination of economic necessities and the imperatives of social justice. Too many Europeans suffer from the fact that our Union does not protect them, does not protect their public services, and it does not pay sufficient attention to the consequences of globalisation. Many fear threats against the most basic structural elements of their social model. In the face of this suffering, our responsibility is of course to guarantee values, but also to prove our willpower through concrete measures. It would be against our values and vain to seek the lowest labour costs, the most docile employees, the weakest taxes, and the most lax environmental, social, health and welfare standards of our competitors. On the contrary, our identity and our strength contribute to the excellence of our working standards of production. This report shows that, beyond our differences, we have a common attachment to a society which is not solely organised by the law of the market, but by solidarity and redistribution and by the protection of our fellow citizens, that is to say our human capital, the most rich and important capital we have. Europe has shown that social security, protection against life's risks and the right to retirement for everyone have been the ingredients of a recipe that is good for citizens, good for society, good for the economy, and one which will remain the path to follow for the future.

Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, six months ago, I was a member of the European Union’s observation mission present at the Palestinian elections. Given this EU presence during the elections in Palestine, I regard the Council’s decision to suspend aid to the Palestinian Authority as illogical. We are rejecting the outcome of an electoral process that we supported and praised for the smooth way in which it was carried out. Is this really helping democracy? Suspending aid amounts to punishing the Palestinian population as a whole, that is to say to punishing not only the Islamists of Hamas, but also the civilian population, the children, the women, the pacifists and the democrats who were represented, I would point out, by 12 other lists of candidates during the elections. Suspending aid means dealing a fatal blow to an emerging and fragile State, as the first people to be affected will be the 150 000 Palestinian civil servants who also oversee health care and educational services and who provide a livelihood for more than a quarter of the population. The World Bank has already sounded the alarm bell about the dangers of a humanitarian crisis. International aid does not serve to support this or that party in power but, in accordance with the Oslo agreements, it does ensure the very existence of the Palestinian Authority and of its basic public services. I should like to inform you, in solemn terms, of the anxiety shared by myself and by many Europeans. This decision is counter-productive and will help to strengthen Hamas. It is liable to make the Palestinian population more radical at a time when it needs aid more than it does lessons if it is to keep hoping for a just and long-lasting peace and to believe in democracy.

 Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, following the Hutchinson report, which we debated yesterday evening, the Cottigny report sets out the debate on the restructuring and relocation of businesses. I would like to thank the two rapporteurs for having raised these socio-economic problems, which create more anguish and social insecurity for our fellow citizens than almost anything else. It is fortunate that Parliament is debating these issues, because, Commissioner, the Commission must take steps as a matter of urgency. These issues set the European Union the challenge of the economic competitiveness of our companies and of job security for European employees. In the minds of European employees, relocation and restructuring are connected and practically synonymous, because they have the same effects: the same loss of their jobs after years of working in the same sector, sometimes even in the same company, and the same questioning of their value on the labour market. This need not be the case, because restructuring is sometimes a sign of progress, technical progress. Restructuring does not have the same economic causes as relocation, and the legislator needs to provide an appropriate solution to each problem. I would like to focus on the issue of restructuring of companies caused by technical developments, which is actually the central point in Mr Cottigny's report. This issue sets the European Union the challenge of adapting to the increasingly rapid developments of our age of technical progress. It really sets us the challenge of anticipating those developments. It has been said that to govern means to foresee. Equally, to do business, to be at the leading edge of production and economic competition, also means to foresee. It is a matter not of adapting to progress but of anticipating it, of inventing it. In this respect, the responsibility rests solely with the companies – they must produce and they must help their employees to anticipate by providing them with continuing training. That is the issue raised by the Cottigny report, and I would ask you, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, to support these proposals.

Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, the Committee on Employment and Social Affairs, for whose opinion I am the draftsman, is in favour of the Commission’s initiative for the Erasmus and Leonardo da Vinci programmes and, in particular, of integrating higher vocational training into the Erasmus programme. Bringing the two together in this way signals our desire not to single out students according to their field of study, be it academic and general, or vocational. I congratulate the rapporteur, Mrs Pack, on the quality of her report and thank her for having taken account of the greater part of the opinions of the Committee on Employment and Social Affairs, in particular as regards lifelong education and training, which together are acknowledged as being one of the keys to growth and as guaranteeing the quality of jobs. Lifelong training should be a right and should be the specific responsibility of businesses, and these factors should be recognised at Community level as a fundamental social right. Thanks to these programmes, a European space for training and education is gradually being created, and we have a great need of this space to support the labour market. We need greater harmonisation and convergence of qualifications, and we need the skills of European employees to be guaranteed throughout the EU, and thus rewarded appropriately. This seems to us to be an effective guarantee against social dumping.

 Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, on this women’s day the long debate we have just had on the situation of women would not be out of place in this debate on the social situation in Europe, because the questions are very much related and women are often the first victims of a much more general situation. The social situation in the European Union in 2004, which we are looking at today and which is the subject of the report we have before us, is alarming. Mass unemployment, social inequalities, instability and insecurity have grown over the last 20 years. Although social development and the fight against poverty are the common objectives of the Member States, we are obliged to note that the laws of the market are today working against the interests of individuals and that more than 70 million European citizens are today at great risk of poverty and insecurity. The question we have to answer is a simple one: are we going to promote social equality and development equality, or are we going to allow free competition to make the social situation in Europe even worse? We must answer that question by adopting a social agenda that takes concrete measures to deal with the problem. I do not have the time to go into details, but I would like to suggest at least two priorities: we must move towards an upward harmonisation of social situations and not use directives to introduce social dumping; we need a sharing of wealth that allows solidarity, not competition between poor regions and rich ones.

 I abstained from voting on the European Commission’s 2004 regular report and recommendations on Turkey’s progress towards accession for the following reasons. I believe that the European Union’s inability to formulate, approve and construct a coherent political project is a major obstacle to the welcoming of Turkey into the Community. It appears to me to be questionable, if not irresponsible, to pursue a policy of never-ending enlargement at a time when the political dimension of the European Union and its social and tax harmonisation are far from a reality. At present, the European Union is not in a position to make political proposals of genuine integration to a country the size of Turkey. I would note that our position is not based on arguments relating to geographical, historical, religious or cultural aspects. It is not Turkey’s ability to meet a certain number of conditions which has caused me to hold such a view, but the European Union’s inability to provide the necessary framework to create a common future.

 Mr President, Mr Lamy, ladies and gentlemen, I should like to thank you, Mr Lamy, for the detailed information you have provided us with on the way in which this reform will be implemented. Against a background of trade globalisation, the reform demonstrates the will of the European Union to make market laws subject to the development objectives of the poorest countries and to human rights objectives, as well as testifying to our ambition to make globalisation more moral. In this context, a thorough evaluation must be carried out of the previous system, and in particular of its impact on the goal of poverty reduction. The complex and partial nature of agreements has sometimes made it impossible to achieve any kind of overview of the way in which the system works, especially as the close relations between exporting countries and certain multinational companies have prevented a thorough evaluation of the system’s impact. The Commission’s proposal to simplify the system is therefore to be welcomed. I should also like to emphasise how important it is to clarify the conditions according to which preferential tariffs are granted, in particular with regard to respect for core labour standards. The need to promote core labour standards goes well beyond relations between poor nations and rich nations. Two conditions must be fulfilled in order to ensure that the system is as meaningful and effective as possible; industrialised countries must naturally be prepared to comply with it, but beneficiary developing nations must also take advantage of it to reduce inequalities within their countries and to improve living and working conditions for their populations. The way to achieve this, of course, is to incorporate criteria and conditions into the system which guarantee respect for workers’ rights and for the human rights conventions to which you referred. In this respect, it is essential that a distinction be made between the ratification of international conventions and their effective application. All our attention must be directed towards ensuring that future regulations clearly indicate the need for beneficiary countries both to have ratified international conventions on core labour standards and to apply them effectively and in full. Procedures for evaluating these two aspects must therefore also be laid down. Whilst on the subject of procedures, why should social partners not be involved in these evaluations by means of consultations? This would provide a guarantee that the experience and practical knowledge held by trade unions in the field of core labour standards would be put to use. More specifically, the European Union should endeavour to promote a greater effectiveness of the instruments of the International Labour Organisation, for example by the possible opening of enquiries to monitor respect for core labour standards under the GSP procedure.

Mr President, I listened to Mr Boso just now, and I am not underestimating the fact that there are special cases, particularly in Italy, where it would be preferable today to see slots opened up. However, I do believe that we need to keep a cool head and recognise that the crisis is affecting the aviation sector more quickly and more profoundly than ever before. It is without doubt one of the first sectors to be affected by budget cuts – corporate budgets, in terms of business travellers, and household budgets, in terms of summer holidaymakers. The other option would have been to open up slots completely, resulting in all likelihood in a scenario where the most powerful airlines would turn their empty aeroplanes round on the best slots, would abandon the least profitable spatial-planning slots, and where the low-cost airlines, which have a different economic model, would take advantage of it to sell off a few slots. In short, this probably would have been a redistribution of roles under the worst of circumstances. It would have had nothing to do with the real economy, with a functioning market; rather, it probably would have played a part in social dumping or in the defence of positions acquired, in the case of the most powerful airlines. That is why I believe that this moratorium is the least worst solution, provided that it is only temporary, that the events and the impact of this crisis are closely monitored, that developments are accounted for before Parliament, and that we open up the slots market while taking the time to effect a policy change and to consolidate a new European Union policy. This is my final speech before this House. It is a great privilege, after 10 years of working in the same committee, to take the floor at what is practically the end of the parliamentary term, in one of the very last debates, and to do so among one’s friends. I should like to say what a pleasure it has been for me to work with such strong and such brilliant personalities; I shall not forget the experience. This committee is an elite committee, I think it must be said. It has done remarkable work; it is a credit to the work of Parliament, it is a credit to the European Parliament. I should like to thank all of my colleagues, from all of the political groups. I do not think that I will enjoy another such rich, honest, sincere and profound political experience as this one. I should also like to say to Mr Tajani that I congratulate him on having accepted such a difficult mandate and portfolio as transport during this term of office, and that, because patience and length of time are what make a person competent here, he deserves to have this portfolio reassigned to him under the Commission’s next mandate. Ladies and gentlemen, thank you for everything.

 Madam President, Commissioner, as it happens, I am not in the middle of an election campaign because I will not be here in the next Parliament. Commissioner, you can therefore do me the honour of not exaggerating. However, I am from Bordeaux. You have visited my region, which produces very little rosé wine, but which very much likes the rosé wine that it produces. I wanted to say to you that I was particularly shocked when I learnt that the European Commission was intending to legalise the production of rosé by blending red and white. In my opinion, this is a counterfeit product, at a time when we are being invited to fight counterfeiting in industry. It would mean authorising or inventing a wine derivative, at a time when we are fighting financial derivatives. In fact, all this stems from exactly the same aim, namely to find new products generating ever more profit. As long as the profit and competitiveness of the European Union are assured, then that is OK. Let me amuse myself by making a suggestion. Here we have a rosé wine. I have just produced this rosé wine, here in the European Parliament, by getting white wine and putting beetroot in it. I can promise you that it has exactly the same colour and, what is more, you can have the whole chromatic range, if you want, and probably a certain taste range. This would also allow us to solve the problems of the sugar industry and chaptalisation using a natural food product. What this quite simply means is that, if we allow this first step, then there will be no end. Other Members have said as much, that food counterfeiting will reign ever more. We therefore say to you: ‘look at what is already happening in some countries’. Today, one-fifth of rosé production involves blending. I would maintain that the Commission does not have to systematically bleed the other four-fifths. There are people who have strived to ensure that rosé exists, that it becomes a genuine wine, produced using genuine oenological methods. We are now pulling the rug from under them on the pretext that it might be more lucrative to surf the rosé market using red and white. I believe that this is profoundly amoral. Personally, I feel that labelling will not suffice or, if labelling is used, this type of blended wine must not be called ‘rosé’. Call it ‘dishwater’ if you like, Commissioner, as that much better suits the quality of the product.
 Gilles Savary,

Commissioner, allow me to take the floor once more to tell you that I have heard your arguments and I am sure that you did not come up with this idea yourself: it must have come from a number of lobbyists. However, I do not think that it is in Europe’s interest to constantly aim low, particularly when it comes to food. Countries which did not aim low on an industrial level are now among the global leaders when it comes to trade. The Germans, in particular, have always fought the temptation to level down. Well I believe that, with regard to the food sector, Europe should fight this constant temptation to level down, because this will take it far. Therefore, what we are proposing is to avoid at all costs having two forms of designation for ‘rosé’: traditional or blended. There is rosé wine, and there is something else. Organise a European competition to name this something else if you think it should be legalised. Personally, I think that Europe would do well to fight the WTO on this type of product. You are always telling us that we ‘capitulate’ with respect to everything that comes from elsewhere.

Mr President, Commissioner, first of all I should like to pay tribute to the sense of compromise shown by our two rapporteurs, Mr Grosch and Mrs Ţicău, since this is a difficult subject in the sense that, yes, we do want the single market, but the public and company directors do not understand that having the single market at times means that some of them will have to fail, that the economy will have to go into recession and that jobs will have to go. In the public’s eyes, it is only worth having the single market if it puts them in a win-win situation. However, we know only too well today that, on issues such as cabotage, social conditions in the various countries are such that, were it to be systematised, we could, as things stand, see a number of workers from countries with high levels of pay ejected, ousted from the market by countries with low levels of pay. I therefore believe that the position adopted is ultimately the right one. Cabotage should be liberalised, but it is still too soon to do so suddenly and indiscriminately. Thus, having the notion of consecutive cabotage, with an adjustment that refers us to a rendez-vous clause for a report by the Commission on the social repercussions, and, above all, not having an automatic and indiscriminate date for liberalisation, suits us very well. That is why we shall vote in favour of this report, while calling on the Commission to be attentive and while expressing the wish for liberalisation ultimately to take place, but not to give rise to unfair competition or social dumping, which do so much damage to Europe’s reputation and which, in a country such as mine and no doubt in that of Mrs Wortmann-Kool, prompted the sudden rejection of the European Constitutional Treaty by citizens fearing the loss of their social position. Thus, I am grateful to the two rapporteurs.

Mr President, Commissioner, thank you. It is a somewhat unprecedented exercise in style that the European Parliament is carrying out on this report since, I would remind you, the issue of urban mobility was first raised by the transport commissioner, Jacques Barrot, over two years ago now, and it resulted in a Green Paper by the European Commission, which submitted its conclusions to us in spring 2007. The latter were addressed in a report – an own-initiative report – by our Parliament, drafted by my fellow Member, Mr Rack, who is here in the Chamber. The European institutional system stipulates that a Green Paper must be followed by a White Paper, and, in the case in point, it was European Commission proposals for action plans on urban mobility that were on the table. I must thank Mr Tajani, who is here, for advising me in December that it would not be politically possible for the European Commission to submit a proposal there and then. It is understandable: for reasons of their own, a number of States have reservations about this now that the European elections are approaching, but Parliament sought to take up the gauntlet. I should also like to pay tribute to my fellow Members present here today, from all the political groups – especially the coordinators – and to the Committee on Regional Development, for having supported my proposal, which was to build on the advantage that we had and to say that, since the Commission could no longer take the initiative, we should do. What we are going to propose is somewhat unprecedented. I do not know whether a precedent has been set, here in this House. We are going to propose to the Commission the action plan that it should have proposed to us. Naturally, no legal openings are to be expected from an own-initiative report such as this. By proposing a very practical action plan, with extremely precise proposals, Parliament, not being the executive, and not being the government of the European Union – that is the Commission’s role – can hope for nothing other than to be heard. I must say in passing that, over the last few months, we have obtained the overwhelming support of all the organisations that take an interest in these matters. They include, in particular – I should like to make the point here for the benefit of the few remaining Members who have some reservations about this initiative – local authorities and all the organisations that represent local authorities, including in countries which, today, plead subsidiarity as a way of explaining to us that this action plan is out of the question. I therefore believe that local authorities have recognised that urban mobility is likely to be one of the major challenges of the 21st century. Why? Because, today, 60% of Europeans live in the urban community. In 2020, this figure will rise to 80%, and we, the European Union, have a legal basis that makes us jointly responsible, with the Member States and local authorities, for transport policy. Would we, as Europeans, give up on having the slightest idea or the slightest initiative in areas in which transport will present the most complicated and, no doubt, the most fundamental problems in the years to come? We think not, and that is why the European Parliament did not want us to keep quiet, did not want us to keep quiet on urban mobility. Rather, in some ways it wanted us to use this initiative to call on the Commission to take up this matter again as a priority for the next mandate. I should like to thank all of the coordinators, since we have worked in an unprecedented manner, we have worked very much upstream, and the report that has been submitted has achieved very broad support within the Committee on Transport and Tourism. I should like to say that this is a report that is based on the principle of subsidiarity. It is out of the question – yes, I have gone on for too long, but I am sure you will forgive your rapporteur, Mr President – for Europe to think about taking any urban transport-related decisions whatsoever on behalf of local authorities. I myself am a local elected representative, and I am very committed to the freedom of administration of local authorities, as the campaigns that I have led in this House with, in particular, Mr Piecyk, my colleague from the Committee on Transport and Tourism, have shown. What I do believe, however, is that Europe can incentivise, can improve the exchange of information and best practices, and that is the essence of our proposals, which will be outlined shortly.
 Gilles Savary, 
 rapporteur.

Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, I should obviously like straight away to reassure Mrs Sommer during this discussion. There have been many laws here that have affected local authorities: on the pitting of the Stadtwerke
, or municipal utilities, against one another, for example; on public service obligations in the transport sector; and on the directives on public contracts. Well, this is not what this is about. This is much more to do with subsidiarity. It is not a question of deciding here that a local council, a municipality or an urban area should become a ‘30 zone’ or should give priority to rail travel. I have made sure that we do not revert to this type of debate. The question I asked myself was: ‘What can the European Union’s added value be?’ The answer is, firstly, its desire to act. The European Union cannot leave the urban question to one side the very same month – December 2008 – that it sets itself, thanks to Mrs Merkel and to Mr Sarkozy, a particularly ambitious climate-change plan. How can we embark on a ‘three times twenty’ climate-change plan and say ‘I am not interested in the urban environment’, when the latter has the biggest influence on climate change? This is a question of political consistency – European political consistency – since we had agreed, and the governments had too, to embark on the climate-change plan. There is a legitimate need to focus on the urban environment, and we cannot escape it, either in the area of transport or in other areas. Yes, we must ensure that local councils take sovereign decisions; they are closer to us. However, what we can do is to ensure that they meet with one another, that they exchange best practices, and information. We can ensure that they are encouraged to implement urban development plans, which is something that they have not all been able to do. We can ensure that they integrate all modes of transport: soft transport, public transport, water transport – Mr Blokland is right – and rail transport. We can ensure that they make urban transport more attractive to users. That is what we are aiming for, and that is why we are calling for a financial instrument. There is Marco Polo, which encourages the use of combined transport. There are the URBAN programmes. We have several European programmes that provide incentives. We are not inventing them this time; that has been going on for years. Without its being increased, the next financial perspective should be reoriented towards urban transport. That is our proposal. To conclude, I would say – Madam President, excuse me, I am the rapporteur – to Mr Tajani that, if, tomorrow, we have a very large majority, he should be able to go back to the Commission and say: ‘I believe that we must do something, because we have legitimacy and because Parliament has not acted alone’.

Madam President, first of all I should like to thank Mrs Jensen for her consistently outstanding work, since it is very open and very alert to all of the opinions expressed. I should like to start by saying that, behind intelligent transport systems, there are all the same European funds, and that I was somewhat amazed to discover how they were practically all channelled towards cars. I believe that cars obviously do have their good points; the automotive sector is an extremely powerful economic sector in Europe. However, I do think that we need to add some intelligence to all modes of transport. I am not overlooking the fact that there is ERTMS for the railways, SESAR, and GALILEO, but in my view we are lacking a user-oriented approach with regard to user information; to accessibility for persons with reduced mobility and the possibility today of adapting urban vehicles; to the introduction of an energy-saving urban vehicle; to safety in the field of transport, especially in relation to public transport, which is a very important issue; to user information; and to ticketing, areas in which there is often considerable progress to be made. I therefore believe that the resources should be diversified in the years to come. In particular, I should like attention to be paid to respect for personal data; we must prevent a situation where we find ourselves back in Orwell’s 1984, where we seek to realise the fantastical notion of replacing humans entirely with machines. We saw what happened on the Hudson River last winter: had there not been a pilot, there would have no doubt been no mechanism that could have straightened up the plane. To conclude, I believe that priority must also be given to modes of transport other than cars. Notwithstanding those reservations, I support the report that has been submitted.

 Mr President, Commissioner, here we are at the end of a legislative marathon that, as has been mentioned, has taken ten years and that, as we were reminded in a debate this morning, has been given the inappropriate name of ‘Erika III’. It is inappropriate because, after the Erika
, there was the Prestige
; after the Prestige
, there was the Tricolor
; and, after the Tricolor
, there were unfortunately plenty of other maritime disasters both in European waters and beyond. Above all, though, it is inappropriate because, as Mr Sterckx pointed out, this is cool legislation, for the first time – in other words, it is free of the passions, excesses and polemics that take over in the wake of disasters such as the Erika
 and the Prestige
. I think it is very much to the credit of Mr Barrot and the Commission that they have proposed it, but it was also a formidably difficult matter. The Member States are not exactly inclined to legislate in fields like this when nothing serious has happened; sometimes, on the other hand, they go overboard with the legislation when there are accidents. In any event, this really is a major piece of legislation, since it contains seven texts. It aims to make the European maritime space – or rather, that of the Member States – one of the safest in the world. This is perfectly justified given that it is also one of the busiest in the world and, in geographical terms, one of the most complicated in the world. We have a number of straits, including the Bosphorus, Gibraltar and Pas-de-Calais – through which 800 commercial ships pass every day – which are among the largest ports on the planet. We therefore had a lot of work to do, not, unfortunately, to ensure that there are no more accidents – life will always be random – but so that we could be sure that we had done our best to prevent them, and also to punish the causes of any such accidents. The structure of this package is simple: it is a virtuous circle, in which each link in the transport chain – from the port state to the insurer, via the charterer, the classification society and the flag state – is responsible for its own actions and in some way applies pressure – or at least that is what we are betting on – to clean up transport conditions and to ensure that they are using a responsible transporter that complies with the standards. Thinking about it, moreover, perhaps it would have been worth basing our model, in terms of its broad principles and structure, on what we are trying to do in the field of finance: The financial ratings agencies have been just as inadequate as the maritime classification societies. Certain Member States accommodate flags of convenience, or tax havens as they are known in the field of finance. Certain operators are not wanted, and are subject to blacklisting or bans in the maritime field. This is, then, a quite exemplary piece of legislation and, moreover, one that fits into the framework of the IMO at international level. I would also say that, in political terms, this is a truly remarkable success for the Community, because the link between the Commission and Parliament has made it possible to produce a very complicated text and piece of legislation about which the Member States were very reticent. I would like to thank Mr Tajani and the Commission. I would also like to thank the French Presidency, because I think that Mr Bussereau realised that this could be something very important during the French Presidency, and I would like to thank all of my fellow Members, because everyone here knows that we made use of subterfuge and magic tricks to get to this point. We have only managed to bring in this maritime package in as much as we have been united, and have shown solidarity to such an extent that certain fellow Members have, so to speak, inherited some stowaways, such as my text and that of Mr Fernandes, which the Council did not want. That, ladies and gentlemen, is why we have succeeded. I would have liked to go into the details of my report, but I think I will have some time to speak at the end, which will give me the opportunity to do so. (Applause)

 Mr President, everyone in Parliament, with just a few exceptions, knows what it means to legislate and to bring added value to a text from the Commission. From that point of view, I would like to echo what Mr Costa said: for Parliament, this is not just a textbook exercise to be proud of, but an exciting reality at a time when Europe needs a lift. I would like to say, because I am not sure whether this has been emphasised sufficiently, that this legislative package of seven plus one texts will, in fact, be going at two speeds: there are five plus one on which we will be asked, tomorrow, to ratify the conciliation procedure and agreement, and two others – the reports by Mr Fernandes and myself – that will go to second reading, because they were initially rejected by the Council. As we have, almost miraculously, reached agreement with the Council, due to the fact that our fellow rapporteurs were kind enough to give us a vehicle within their own reports so that the Council would agree and be required to state its position, we are only at second reading on the reports by Mr Fernandes and myself. Of course, we do not want them to be amended, and I do not think they will be, as no amendments have been tabled. We hope that they will be adopted in their current form tomorrow. This will allow us to re-integrate the package, having achieved a very pleasing success with respect to the Council. I would say to you, Commissioner, that the ball is now in the Commission’s court: we are all aware that, in order to monitor the implementation of this legislation, in many fields, legislating here is not enough – the texts need to be transposed in the Member States. Personally, with regard to the requirement for insurance against damages to third parties, in other words, serious pollution and damages subsequent to a maritime accident, I think we need to ensure that, in particular, the major international conventions are ratified, because that is a commitment made by the Member States. I also think it would be good for the Commission to report to Parliament on this subject in 2012.
 Gilles Savary  (PSE

 Mr President, I would like to start by congratulating Mr El Khadraoui on having reached a compromise, but we must not pretend that this text is not a very fragile one. It is suffering from the external costs of the crisis, by which I mean that there is considerable pressure and considerable concern on the part of the road hauliers. Moreover, when it landed in the office of our co-legislator, it had quite a different nature, because oil was at USD 57 a barrel. It is therefore a text that was born under difficult circumstances, but I would like to say at this point, because I have been surprised by some of the things I have heard, that it is not a text that introduces a tax or a toll: it is the individual Member States that will decide whether to introduce a tax or a toll. It is a text that, like the two previous ones, aims to define the conditions for road tolls in the various countries in order to avoid excessive distortions and so as not to create distortions of competition or discrimination. We do, in my view, need to be quite clear on this. The text complies completely with the principle of subsidiarity, and it is also fair. I would say that I am very pleased with it on behalf of my own country because it will make it possible to obtain a contribution to the infrastructure of a transit country such as France from heavy goods transporters that currently go through the country without buying a drop of petrol and without spending a cent. I therefore think that this will be a beneficial text.

Madam President, first of all, I too would obviously like to express my condolences and offer my sympathy firstly to those families who are in mourning, and to all those who are victims, in particular the many who have been cut off and who today still lack electricity, water or public services. Commissioner, I listened to you promise us – and I think you were right – that crisis prevention measures would be consolidated, but the issue this evening, if I may say so, is compensation for the last crisis. This is the third catastrophic storm in 20 years. The first one, as you will remember, was in July 1988, in Brittany. It still holds the wind speed record: over 250 km/h. The second, which was on an unprecedented scale, was the storm of 27 December 1999. It flattened most of our forests, for the first time. The third storm was on 24 January 2009. The reason I remember it is that I live in Gironde, very close to the Gironde forests. The first thing we need to do is ask ourselves what the European Union's added value might be. In forestry the situation is catastrophic and what threatens us is that foresters have stopped foresting, by which I mean that some of them believe this profession has become unsustainable. We must therefore put a plan in place, and I am among those who were ready, almost 10 years ago now, to consider a joint crisis organisation, so that we can sell all the wood which has now been placed on the market rather involuntarily, without affecting the price: we could do this by blocking supplies from other European regions, by funding transport and by making sure that this land can be replanted very quickly; otherwise, I think it will become subject to speculation, or even abandoned. Here we have a problem which is of direct interest to the European Union. Secondly, I am also thinking of the oyster-farmers. Today the profession is in dire straits. It was already in trouble in 2002 after another disaster which was not at all natural, the sinking of the Prestige
, and at present the oyster-farmers of the Arcachon Basin are losing all hope of being able to get back on their feet. Finally, I would like the European Union Solidarity Fund to be mobilised. Obviously, I sympathise with what Mrs Laperrouze has said. Today, the Council is not here. It will do it no harm and I think it is extremely disappointing that it has refused to change the rule and that this fund today is so difficult to mobilise. I ask you, moreover, whether the French Government itself has mobilised it. I am among those who will strive to see that it does this, because I believe it is very important, a few months from the elections, that our citizens know that European solidarity does exist and that Europe is not just dominated by the market.

Madam President, Commissioner, you have just supported us in the initiative that we, the European Parliament, plan to take on this issue. You have just told us that, for obvious reasons, that is, because of the importance of urban transport in the transport field, and because of the objectives of the European climate-change plan, the European Union cannot fail to take an interest in urban transport. Mr Barrault, before you, took the initiative of introducing a Green Paper, with the promise of an action plan. You cannot today deny us this action plan and explain to us that you are implementing it on the quiet, without Parliament’s deliberations, without Parliament’s control, without any visibility. It is for this reason that I managed to get my fellow Members – and I must thank them, especially Mr Rack, who did a huge amount of the groundwork – to agree to the European Parliament’s doing something completely out of the ordinary and producing the action plan that you do not want to produce, in an own-initiative report, before the elections. This entirely heterodex initiative will carry considerable political weight, since it will involve questions being put to the new European Commissioner for Transport, who will be heard by the Committee on Transport and Tourism, and it will therefore carry a great deal of weight in terms of his approval by the European Parliament. I find it regrettable in fact that, today, the European Commission should give in to any old objection from any old Member State. And it is precisely because we are concerned about this development, which is an institutional drift, whereby the European Commission has decided no longer to play the Community card, but the strictly intergovernmental one, that we are today validated in our desire to negotiate an action plan among ourselves, to submit it to you and to ensure that the next transport commissioner makes a clear commitment regarding the follow-up action to be taken on it.

 Madam President, I very much regret that Mr Pöttering did not give me the floor when I requested it, because I was simply asking him for the right of reply, and I would have preferred it to be while the President of the Council was here. I am incensed at the scapegoating of the French Socialists that we heard here. I have never, never seen a President-in-Office of the Council call into question any political party. I have never seen a President of the French Republic ridicule his compatriots in an international arena like this, and I therefore find it offensive, and I should have liked to have a formal apology from the French Government.

 Mr President, since I became a shadow rapporteur when the Council swept away my report, I have only two minutes to speak. I will therefore cut to the chase, firstly to say that I am not addressing the French Presidency, which is supporting us, or the Commissioner, who is supporting us, but the Council. I am also addressing my fellow Members to thank them for their solidarity, and to say that the Erika
 and the Prestige
 were very bad experiences. The Member States have accused Europe of not doing enough about them. Now, thanks to Commissioner Barrot, we are attempting to establish, from scratch, an honourable European maritime transport space. One of the measures we are proposing is shipowners’ civil liability. What does that mean? It means that, at the very least, we are ensuring that all vessels are insured by solvent insurance companies for the damage they cause, at least within the framework of the IMO conventions. In La Rochelle I was pleased to see Member States who had not joined the IMO suddenly becoming ardent fans of the organisation. My advice to them is to ratify the IMO conventions, starting with the one on chemicals. There could be a chemical hazard, a chemical disaster, today, or tomorrow morning. We would be transported back to the time of the Exxon Valdez
. Practically no Member States have made a legal commitment as regards chemical hazards with the IMO. That is the first thing. The second is to create a guarantee and insurance certificate for the European maritime transport space. We need to have confidence in Europe. When it forges ahead, it takes the world with it. We have seen this particularly with the airlines blacklist. Ladies and gentlemen, I was recently at a symposium looking at whether the Erika
 was still possible. Indeed it is, and it was so in the Black Sea on 11 November 2007, when five vessels sank in the Strait of Kerch with worthless insurance policies. I genuinely believe we need to sort this out, and that is why I think, President-in-Office, that Parliament’s resistance is not a question of pride. It is a question of public health and public interest. We will never accept the blame here for Member States’ negligence if they fail to do their bit. I am counting on you.
 Gilles Savary  (PSE

 Madam President, I would first like to thank the Council and the Commission for agreeing to Parliament’s request for a debate on this issue: a very topical issue that is of concern to us. We have talked about it in particular in the Committee on Transport and Tourism, where we were visited by Mr De Rossa, who gave us an idea of the extent of the problem. I would like to say that we should congratulate ourselves on the rapidity of the reaction by the Member States concerned – I am talking about France and Spain – and on what has already been done in the UN and the Council. I think that is quite a quick response. I think we need to avoid several things. Firstly, demands by civil vessels for weapons. I can see this happening and I think we need to watch out because we know this would only make the situation more dangerous. Secondly, we need to make sure we do not neglect the situation and let it drift into terrorism. I mean that we should prevent political groups from getting involved because it would then assume completely different proportions. Thirdly, we need to avoid a situation where Member States are acting separately. In this regard, I was just thinking about the Stability Pact. Obviously we demand that certain Member States do not have a deficit, but these are the same Member States who are always asked to provide protection because they have the means to do so. I therefore believe we need to show a bit more solidarity there at EU level, and that those who do not have the means to be protected are protected by those who have the military means. In this case, let us draw any conclusions we might like to draw at any level. I would also like to say that, although it is a matter of great urgency that we provide a deterrent, through the measures taken by the French Government, for example, and on the Ponant
 and the Carré d’as
, we know very well that crime is part of human nature but its legitimacy feeds on people’s despair. It is therefore very important to take diplomatic action towards these countries and find ways of helping them from the point of view of both security and development. Then they will not have to endlessly look on with an empty stomach as plates of plenty go by.

 I abstained from voting on the European Parliament resolution on the events in South Ossetia and Abkhazia since the Parliament took a one-sided, unbalanced position towards Kosovo’s unilateral declaration of independence from a normalised, democratised Serbia. Parliament did not consider it appropriate to take a similar resolution on Kosovo in the name of the same principles of respect for international law and integrity of national borders that it is invoking today to denounce recognition of the independence of Ossetia and Abkhazia by Moscow. We all know why: we did not want to criticise the countries of the West – 
which were quick to recognise the unilateral and illegal declaration of independence by Kosovo –
 for the things for which we are today quite rightly criticising Russia. Although the Georgian government’s military initiatives, like those of Russia, should be firmly condemned and should make way for a diplomatic settlement and international mediation, the European Union cannot allow itself to apply double standards to the many ‘frozen conflicts’ of the aftermath of the Cold War. Nothing would be worse for the security of our continent than for the European Union to confuse alliances and allegiance to the ‘crime-inducing’ politics of the Bush government in this part of the world, as it has in other parts.

 Mr President, there is hypocrisy first of all in saying that consumers are injured. There is not a consumer on the streets of Europe who knows what an airline computerised reservation system is. Not one! All consumers use private booking systems, the internet or the telephone. What this is about today is the relationship between the airlines and the information they give out about their flights, particularly to travel agents. This text moralises, and introduces very strong transparency and non-exclusivity principles. It is a text that takes the traditional view when it comes to competition law and controlling mergers. A number of lobbies are using it to try and force off the board of directors those who, in Europe, created the largest computerised reservation system. That would be a very serious matter because we have never done anything here but enact competition rules and methods for controlling them. We have never forced anyone to adopt a particular status, or a particular shareholder base. That is why, ladies and gentlemen, I will vote for the compromise found, skilfully and through a lot of work, by Mr Kirkhope, between the Council, all the Member States of the Council – as I recall –, the European Parliament and the European Commission. It would be better to vote in favour of this compromise than to re-enter a war with the lobbies, in view of the many interests at stake, and to prevent this text from ultimately being substantially modified, which would do consumers a disservice.

Madam President, Commissioner, I first of all want to pay tribute to Paulo Costa for his excellent work. We are dealing here with a highly technical area that is far from popular. Nonetheless, when discussing the climate plan and the aim of reducing greenhouse gases, the issue of rail transport and transport other than road transport arises. In that respect, we have done a lot of work over the last two parliamentary terms to open up the networks. However, there is still an obstacle to the opening-up of the networks that we absolutely have to remove: the absence of technical interoperability, which is caused by numerous elements, including the many different types of control-command systems, stock recognition – which we are discussing here – and, in particular, track gauge. I am from a region called Aquitaine, where we have to change the axles of trains that come from Spain to ensure a fluid flow of traffic. These questions, which appear to be eminently technical, are actually eminently political because they determine our transport policy and the political priority of the fight against greenhouse gases and climate change. Both of these texts are extremely important. I would like to thank Paolo Costa for the new proposals he has put forward, notably on the mutual recognition obligation. There are several ways of hindering the opening of the European networks. The rail networks were built on very national or nationalist bases. One way of hindering it is to show little or no desire to achieve mutual recognition of stock. From now on, I hope that, thanks to the text that we are going to adopt, we will have European legislation that will allow us to do away with this obstacle, which has been particularly effective between France and Germany. I would also like to echo what my colleague Mr Rack said about the Agency: I believe that it is extremely important to give the Agency the resources it needs for its development and perhaps its democratisation so that Parliament can be more involved.
 Gilles Savary  (PSE

 Mr President, I would first of all like to thank our two rapporteurs for the excellent work that they have done, and then hope that, under the French Presidency, this very important road package will obviously have a future and come to a conclusion. I would first like to focus on two subjects. The first is cabotage and the date that the European Parliament deemed right to set, in other words automatic liberalisation in 2014. From this point of view, there is a natural distortion created between the peripheral countries and the transit countries. Countries such as France, Germany and probably Austria are by nature the most cabotaged countries, and the fact that we have just chosen a definition of cabotage that involves cabotage following an international journey is a good thing, but it means that the social issue is definitely going to create considerable distortions, while in carriage by road, it is the principle of the country of origin that applies, once one is mobile. I therefore think that it would have been much wiser to wait, as was initially planned, for a report from the Commission enabling us to take stock of the social distortions before deciding on automatic liberalisation. My second point relates to the derogation concerning driving time for buses. As I have already said, without going into the subject in depth, I find this procedure detestable. Under pressure from pressure groups, an amendment has been tabled which is an amendment to a text that is not the original text. This issue should be resolved by a new proposal from the Commission, amending what we called here the ‘Markov report’. I would also like to remind you that we are tabling an amendment to the Markov report in the form of a regulation when the Markov report was a directive. Ladies and gentlemen, I am not – ah, it was a regulation, you are right, it was a regulation – but, in any case, I think that the formats need to be the same and that we should not get into this habit of tabling amendments, under pressure from pressure groups, to texts other than the original text.

 Mr President, I am one of those who was present at the start of the Galileo project, and so I am perhaps rather better placed to gauge the extent of the delay. I believe that this project has two inherent defects. Firstly, it is the first major Community project of industrial interventionism. It has not been easy to persuade people that the EU could own a satellite navigation system, and it therefore took a long time to obtain a political consensus. Secondly, the business plan could not be how it was imagined initially, simply because GPS, our major competitor, is free and is fully financed by the US government. We needed to overcome these two initial problems and take stock of the situation, spurred on by the Slovenian presidency and by Mr Barrot, before establishing a remarkable consensus between the three institutions. This tripartite dialogue has brought us to a point where we now have a document and a text. Tomorrow will see the launch of Galileo, before the second satellite is launched on Saturday from Baikonur.

Madam President, I think that the issue we shall be voting on tomorrow is a historic one, because the post has been a public service from the early days, especially since monarchies. That was because the distribution of mail is strategic, and it also ensured a universal and fast service. We have just put an end to public control of postal services, or we shall be ending it tomorrow, to replace it with a largely deregulated postal market. What is proposed in this directive will first of all be a wonderful market for lawyers and legal practitioners, because it is not harmonisation. Each Member State can decide on its own method of financing and there are four different methods. The directive also proposes something completely paradoxical: compensating for the financing of the universal service through State subsidies where, in some countries, what was not financially viable was financed by equalisation when that was viable. I think we are making a mistake. Time will tell, but we already have some indications of that today. Over EUR 880 million have been invested in the postal service in the United Kingdom. In Spain it has just been announced that, because of the pressure of competition, rural areas will no longer receive a direct postal service. The Germans are having problems in bringing the minimum wage into line with the postal services market. My feeling is that we are now benefiting companies, we are going to let them cream off the best part of the market, but we are not serving the general interest in postal services or the external competitiveness of the European Union.

 Madam President, I first wish to congratulate our rapporteur, Mr Castiglione, for bringing about a considerable shift in the Commission’s positions. We are certainly faced with a paradox here: on the one hand, there has never been so much wine drunk all over the world, and on the other, although in 10-15 years we will be witnessing record progress in wine consumption worldwide, we are told that Europe is overproducing. Thus I have the feeling that, rather than overproduction, what we have here is a sales problem, mainly down to marketing, and that is why I do not want the reform proposed to us today to be tempted to lower the sector’s standards even slightly in order to fall into line with the new wine-producing countries. We must remember what has happened to European industry. Today Europe’s leading industrial producer is Germany. Germany has stayed at the top of the class, it has refused to cut down on production and today it is the world’s leading exporter, even with the arrival of China and India on the international stage. We cannot cut back on the quality of our vineyards and their brand image. We must not, therefore, give in to a crude industrialisation of the wine industry, which in the future would supply us with Heineken wine, Danone wine, Coca-Cola wine and Pepsi-Cola wine. I do feel, however, that the Commission is tempted to get rid of the smallest and favour the biggest. That would result in us losing our soul! I am thus asking you, Commissioner, to ensure that all of the elements that contribute to the quality of wine and can improve that quality – reducing yields, marketing support, careful protection of geographical indications and designations of origin – are preserved, not only within the EU, but also outside it, when it comes to major multilateral negotiations. I feel this is extremely important: otherwise we will be losing what is undoubtedly one of the most important elements of our agricultural industry, and our European civilisation: wine is a product of culture and civilisation. This is why we cannot give in to the mirages of the market and industrialisation.

 Mr President, personally I am just as keen as Mr Jarzembowski that local authorities should be free to govern and I do not think that we can impose any sort of transport policy on an independent local authority elected by universal suffrage. We would be misguided to do so. That said, it seems to me that the Community added-value is indisputable, since we are trying to tackle the greenhouse effect. What we are dealing with is the production of pollutants, particularly at regional level, by transport, which we know is the main source of pollutants and greenhouse gases. Therefore, I do not think it is excessive for the European Union to become involved, including for conservation reasons. On the other hand, I do believe that there cannot be any coercive policy. There could be an incentive policy, Commissioner. I sometimes like to think that this would be hugely successful if there were, for example, a Community URBAN programme for transport; in other words, a programme that encourages local authorities to engage in sustainable mobility based on a set of sustainable mobility guidelines. I do not know whether you can envisage this.

Mr President, allow me to say at the outset that I share the general satisfaction with this Railway Package. We have come a long way. We had four texts when we set out and we have ended up with three. We started work in 2004 and here we are now in September 2007. In other words, we certainly took the slow train rather than the TGV. It has been a long journey but we are now at the end of the line. We have made it, I believe, thanks first and foremost to the considerable determination of the Members of this House and the fact that they pulled together: I refer particularly to all the parliamentary groups and to the three rapporteurs, who are with us today, but credit also goes to everyone, including the shadow rapporteurs, who did his or her bit. We are also indebted to the European Commission, and I should like to thank Commissioner Barrot and his colleagues for their cooperation at difficult stages, because the conciliation procedure was extremely tricky and the odds appeared to be against us. We are indebted, too, to the German Presidency and to the German Federal Minister for Transport, Mr Tiefensee, who invested considerable personal effort: he participated in a number of conciliation meetings and I believe that without his determination to succeed we should not have this Railway Package before us today. I am thinking in particular of the most problematic text, namely the proposal on passengers’ rights. In that regard, I would also pay tribute to the work done by Dirk Sterckx. The degree of resistance to rail passengers’ rights is a somewhat curious thing. It is true that railways are different from roads inasmuch as they are subject to remote control. It is also true that delays can sometimes have a knock-on effect; it is true that security has to come first and that trains may be delayed for quite respectable reasons. Nonetheless, we are lagging decades behind air transport in this respect, and the obstacle we encountered was the tremendous conservatism of the European railway world: its tremendous resistance to passengers’ rights – which was in the end overcome because we agreed to derogations that may leave us looking at implementation in 15 years’ time, around 2023. So, while we may be proud of this text, we have less to shout about with regard to the timetable: it is not really good enough, in my opinion, to introduce passengers’ rights over a possible 15-year timescale if our aim – and it is our aim today – is to develop rail travel. I must say that I am also personally pleased by the introduction of a European rail driver’s licence – for that is what is meant by ‘certification of train drivers’. It is a somewhat complex matter. Georg Jarzembowki outlined the details pretty well, and I believe that what we have before us reflects excellent work by the Members of this House on all sides. I am grateful to Mr Jarzembowki’s group, which does not always take such an open approach on these matters but which, in this case, was particularly supportive. I should like to think that what has been achieved sets a good example because it came out of dialogue between both sides of the industry in question. It is, in effect, an example that can be held up to anyone doubting the capacity of the European Union to be a Union of its citizens. I think it deserves to be publicised. Let me say, too, that I attach great importance to the commitment we have made – a commitment obtained by the European Parliament – concerning train staff responsible for security tasks. These people are not train drivers but they nonetheless save lives because, on board trains, it is their job to do so and it is very important that there should be a system of certification for them, even if it will naturally be at a different level from driver certification. I hope, therefore, that the clause incorporating that commitment, which we succeeded in having included, will be honoured. Lastly, with regard to opening up and liberalising rail networks, I believe that if we are serious about creating a Europe-wide rail culture, we have to begin by accepting that other people’s trains will run across our territory. That prospect is unavoidable. For my own part, I advocate a staged approach. Not all of us will achieve the same level of readiness and, moreover, even when we have our impressive directives in place, there will be entire countries that will still not open their networks. I am thinking here of Ireland because it has no international lines, and possibly also of Finland because it is, to some extent, the end of the line and would be more inclined – quite legitimately – to open its network to Russia; and I am thinking particularly of all the countries that have different load gauges and different track gauges. In other words, the big challenge and the first challenge, when we talk of creating a Europe-wide rail culture, is interoperability, and that is where we need to focus our efforts over the coming years. This Europe-wide rail culture will of course require directives about liberalisation but we need to begin by investing in the networks to make technical interoperability feasible. Opening the market to competition between France and Spain will mean little, because so long as we keep different track gauges we will not increase either freight or passenger traffic. The report on certification of train drivers can be seen, in some respects, as a report on interoperability. What is required is social interoperability that will allow drivers from different countries to think of themselves as Europeans, rather than nationals of a particular state. It is my belief that if we can move beyond national cultures on the railways, then we shall be able to ensure that the railways have a future. As road traffic and air traffic continue to grow, that is an urgent task.

The catastrophic storm in December 1999, floods in Central Europe in 2002, fires in Portugal and Spain in 2004, and now fires in Greece in which people have lost their lives, and also in Romania and Bulgaria: each time there is a strong emotional response, each time Europe sympathises, each time the Commission promises to improve its solidarity and its aid mechanisms. Right here, on 18 January 2000 in fact, I called for the creation of a public safety Eurocorps, and the idea was taken up by Commissioner Barnier in his May 2006 report. Right here in this Parliament, we have called in vain for the renewal of the 1992 regulation under which funding would be provided for fire-prevention equipment such as firebreaks, access roads and monitoring systems. Now we must not wait for the next disaster, for more victims. Let us put the Barnier proposal into practice. There is a military Eurocorps. Surely Europe can set up a public safety Eurocorps for itself, to protect its citizens against natural and accidental risks? Then we should ask Member States to draw up plans to prevent forest fires and help them, encourage them, to finance these through a specific financing instrument similar to that in the old 1992 regulation. When we are facing climate change, it is in the interests of the whole of Europe to introduce ambitious prevention policies.

Mr President, I should first like to thank Mrs Ayala Sender for her initiative. Commissioner, I believe, in fact, that we are still not used to talking about logistics, either at European level or in the Member States. Often we have a road policy, a railway policy, an aviation policy, a maritime policy, and in some countries we find it very difficult to coordinate them. Logistics involve no more nor less than avoiding too many transfers between the different modes of transport and making sure that optimum use is made of them where they are most efficient or profitable. In that respect, I think that the work started by Mrs Ayala Sender is very promising and we are, of course, looking forward to the Commission communication. I should also like to reiterate the point made by the Committee on Industry, Research and Energy. In my view, not enough emphasis has been placed on the reports on the environmental aspects of the question. Clearly we have to develop logistics in Europe and transport policy is an adjunct to the internal market and its development, but we cannot, on the one hand, have ambitious plans to reduce greenhouse gases and, on the other hand, be over-modest. In that respect, I am concerned at the fact that 60-tonne lorries have been allowed to creep into all the reports. An earlier report referred modestly to a European modular concept; some reports talk about megatrucks and gigaliners, the theory of the road lobby being that the larger the lorry the less it will consume and the greater the saving. That is untrue. The larger the lorry, the more competitive it is compared with the rail and waterway transport, and the more the Commission policy on railways, waterways and motorways of the sea will be undermined. It will not even be worth talking about any more. There will still be just as many lorries, but what is certain is that there will be far more goods on the roads and we shall have failed.

Mr President, I must first render the things that are SESAR's unto SESAR, or to another Italian, Paolo Costa, who is actually the author of this written question and has asked me to stand in for him and put it to you in his absence. This is an oral question to the Commission with debate on the creation of functional airspace blocks for building the Single European Sky, in other words, the intentions of the Commission regarding the implementation, or progress to date in the implementation of the package of texts which were the subject of conciliation in December 2003, 'the Single Sky package' One of the texts provided for the creation of functional airspace blocks, in other words airline routes at the various airspace levels, in order to optimise consumption, reduce greenhouse gases and if possible reduce congestion at the busiest airports, not forgetting the possibility of bringing down air transport costs. This is a particularly sensitive issue, with reservations on the part of the Member States, which have always reaffirmed their sovereignty over their airspace. That is especially true of the Member States – and I know of one that is dear to me, my own country – which have large military forces and military airspace blocks reserved in a virtually discretionary fashion. Mr Costa is concerned that, as we might have feared, no progress has been made, as far as he can see, on that text on the creation of airspace blocks, one of the four on the Single Sky, and it has met with strong resistance from the Member States. Mr Costa is therefore putting the following question to the Commission. The Commission has just produced a communication making it clear that the cost of not having functional airspace blocks for building a Single European Sky is about EUR 1 billion. Mr Costa has put an initial question: is the Commission satisfied with that situation and does it believe that the introduction of Regulation (EC) No 551/2004 on airspace organisation is progressing satisfactorily? How does the Commission account for the fact that no new functional airspace blocks have become operational since the Regulation came into force? Article 10 of the Regulation provides for an extension of airspace organisation to lower airspace and requires the Commission to determine any other steps that might be necessary 'in the light of progress achieved'. In view of that, what changes does the Commission think should be made to existing legislation? Finally, does the Commission agree that it should not wait until the end of 2008 before bringing forward a proposal to that effect? Finally – there is more than one question in the oral question – Mr Costa is asking whether the Commission agrees that the 'bottom up' approach, whereby the initiative to create functional airspace blocks is left to the Member States, has failed and that a more proactive approach by the European Union is now required? I think, and I hope I have remained true to its spirit, that that is the question Mr Costa is putting to the Commission.

Mr President, Commissioner, I should like to begin by congratulating my fellow Members, Mario Mauro and Paolo Costa, on the excellent work that they have done. We were keen to ensure that the call for proposals could take place and not be prevented or hindered by the slow pace of our parliamentary work. I believe that we will be very close to the end if we go along with Mr Mauro’s voting advice tomorrow. For my part, I shall do so. I would like to say that, by means of this regulation, we have worked hard on the substance. This regulation is much better than the previous one in many respects. In fact, it is almost a shame that we have such a good instrument for managing such a miserable amount of money. Why is it better? Because, by concentrating the funds, by increasing the levels and by creating more types of funding, we have managed to identify genuinely European priorities. We have the means to promote European projects and therefore not to be content with funds being scattered across different Member States for vote-catching projects. I believe that that is extremely important and I personally am pleased about it. I should like to say that, with regard to this regulation, which is going to enter into force very quickly, two difficulties remain. Firstly – I say this here, and we will see it in practice – I frankly find the EIB to have a blatant conflict of interests. In this House, we are constantly being asked to put up great walls of China in order to compartmentalise accounts in companies, and then, lo and behold, we see that the EIB is going to issue loans for companies for which it itself is going to provide guarantees, and even manage the interest subsidies! I think that that is excessive. We must keep an extremely close eye on all of this, in order to ensure that it does not help itself to the best bits and leave the worst bits for everybody else. Secondly, there was that issue of the information for MEPs. We have the word and the letter of the Commissioner and very soon we will have the necessary documents, I believe. I acknowledge that. I would have preferred an inclusion within the body of the text, of course. Finally, there is a cloud hanging over this project and over the programming, and that cloud is Galileo. I believe that we must be clear on this subject. We have a very good regulation for intervention, but we still have to recover around EUR 2 to EUR 2.7 billion, and my wish is that, just as for the funding initially provided for, we tap as little as possible into the elements of the financial perspective connected with the trans-European transport networks.

Mr President, I personally shall not take the responsibility for opposing the compromise, because the first reading has lasted seven years. After a very chaotic procedure, we had better not have a second reading that lasts as long. I should like to say first that, on the whole, I am satisfied with this text. We needed legal certainty and not to leave the decision to the judges all the time. We have also obtained, for the first time, recognition of the free administration of local authorities. For the rest, this is a text that is nonetheless very complicated, which proceeds from a compromise on the protection of rail transport for some, and of joint local and regional urban transport for others. I am not sure that this is very easy to interpret, I am not sure that this is simply a win-win game, and I am not sure that we ought not to come back to it pretty quickly in order to clarify, for example, what is called cantonment, what are called public-private partnerships, and what is called subcontracting without a tender process, which are all so many loopholes that make it possible to avoid playing the game by the common rules.

Madam President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, it happens that I myself was rapporteur for the first part of this maritime package during the last part-session, in March, since we decided to deliberate on the Vincenzi report on flag States and on my report on civil liability. I believe that it is very important to reaffirm today that this is indeed a comprehensive package and to send out a message to the Council that it should not act like the Horiaces and the Curiaces. We want to remain very cohesive, and I hope that we shall manage to do so, because this package is made up of a set of extremely important and particularly exemplary texts. Just the once will not hurt: we are going to deliberate on maritime safety texts cold, that is to say, without having the pressure of disastrous events. I was here, in this Chamber, during the time of the two previous disasters, with the ‘Erika’ and the ‘Prestige’. I was also here for what were, at times, hypocritical questions from the Member States pointing out Europe’s shortcomings: well, what is Europe doing, then? It is Europe’s fault that there is such a lack of foresight, it is Europe’s fault that ships are allowed to sail in such a state, and it is Europe’s fault that there are no guidelines on how to compensate for the ecological disasters that have resulted from this. Well, it will not be the fault of Europe, but of the Member States, that we are getting to the end of the exercise to which we are summoned today. One can see, incidentally, from the first two packages, that, when the Member States are told to ‘go for it’ on legislative issues, well, they are far less enthusiastic and it takes far longer for the texts to be applied. We therefore have here a legislative package of seven particularly consistent texts, in a European maritime environment that is undoubtedly – it must be said – one of the most fragile and most hazardous in the world. We have a complicated geography and risk areas: the Pas-de-Calais – the increase in traffic in the Pas-de-Calais has caused and continues to cause major accidents – the Baltic and the Oresund, and the Bosporus, without forgetting Gibraltar. Moreover, we are one of the world’s greatest maritime powers, probably the greatest, despite the fact that China is in the process of overtaking us. It is therefore absolutely vital for us to have a powerful body of law, allowing us to protect Europe and to send out a signal to everyone that we have safety requirements and that those requirements are first and foremost preventive. None of us wants to make charterers pay and to force them to give back ill-gotten gains, but we do want charterers, together with all those operating in the maritime transport sector, to be far more careful and to know that pressure is going to be put on them by insurance companies and by all the partners, so that they are extremely rigorous and take the fewest possible risks. There will always be accidents, but I believe that we will pride ourselves on having done all that we can, whilst remaining within the framework of the international law of the International Maritime Organisation, to create an exemplary European area of maritime law.

Mr President, just the once will not hurt, and are we not much better off for it? We are going to be able to legislate on a maritime safety package without any accidents having taken place. On previous occasions, we had to mourn the sinking of the ‘Erika’, a catastrophic sinking with pollution at sea and the very difficult task of salvaging the wreckage, and the sinking of the ‘Prestige’, about which you know more than anyone, as a Spanish national, and which had a huge impact on our coastlines. Therefore, I believe that the Commissioner should be congratulated for having proposed to us this package of seven texts, which must remain a broad-based proposal from the Commission and the European Parliament to the Council, even though two of them are slightly ahead of their time. We have worked hard on this matter, and I should like, in this regard, to thank all of my colleagues, in particular the other political groups, for the excellent work that we have been able to produce and for the outstanding vote that we have obtained, which testifies to a very strong desire from Parliament to genuinely signal its consent, today, to this ‘maritime safety’ package. It naturally falls to me to present you with a report – and probably a rather complicated one at that – on the civil liability of shipowners and of financial guarantees responsible for basically covering damages to third parties. We are not talking here about damages between two vessels that might collide, or between parties involved in the transport chain, that is to say, between charterers and shipowners, but about damage caused to third parties, in particular environmental damage. What the Commission is proposing – and I believe that this is really the minimum that should be asked of the Member States – is to ratify the major International Maritime Organisation conventions on liability and compensation of third parties. From this perspective, there is a general convention that covers all kinds of damages, the LLMC, which has not been ratified by a number of Member States, particularly in its 1996 version. The HNS Convention, which concerns chemical risks, has not been ratified. We are completely exposed today to chemical risks, much more so than to oil risks, and we know that what is transported on Europe’s seas is often very dangerous. Then there are two other conventions: one on the protection of people abandoned at sea – you will have heard about these crazy situations in which sailors cannot leave their vessel after the shipowner has gone bankrupt and who remain berthed for months on end – and one on liability for damage produced by bunker oil, otherwise known as degassing. What the Commission is therefore proposing is to have these conventions ratified. Parliament voted for this proposal and wanted all these conventions – particularly the chemical convention – to be ratified. This was not proposed directly by the Commission, but we would stress our desire to ratify. Secondly, we believe that a regime for withdrawing the benefit of limitation of liability should be implemented for ships that belong to States that have refused to ratify the conventions, whether they be non-EU States or EU Member States that balk at doing so. I believe that Mr Jarzembowski is very keen on this increased clampdown on ships belonging to States that have not ratified, the aim being to encourage them to do so. In such cases, it is not inexcusable conduct that is reprehensible, but gross negligence, and gross negligence means that, in actual fact, the liability and compensation regime is infinitely more severe. Finally, we have endorsed the Commission proposal to create a financial guarantee certificate and to monitor it by creating, within the Maritime Safety Agency or elsewhere, an office providing information on the validity of the certificates, particularly for ships that pass through territorial waters and that do not dock at ports, the aim being to guarantee a maximum level of safety. I believe, ladies and gentlemen, that this is a text that does credit to the European Parliament and that drives the Member States into a corner. I am one of those who greatly suffered, when the ‘Erika’ went down, on hearing a number of Heads of State or Government, including my own, undermine Europe by saying: ‘ ‘Erika’ is Europe’s fault; there is no legislation’. Well, today, there is legislation. It is extremely strict, and we dare the Council and the Member States to implement it.

 Mr President, I should like to say how very pleased I am about the considerable wisdom displayed by Parliament in rejecting the liberalisation of the railway system and of the national railway systems. I personally am very much in favour of opening up the networks and I am a great believer in constructing railways without borders in Europe, something that would effectively spell the end of the national monopolies. That being said, I consider that the Commission’s proposed method of liberalisation, which will be characterised by conflict over deadlines and dates, is unacceptable and will inevitably lead to a situation in which the railway economy is focused on a few big companies, with many national companies disappearing and a big battle taking place over the most profitable market segments, that is to say the high-speed lines, and with great difficulty probably being encountered in financing budget headings relating to town and country planning. Railway services also include regional trains and main line services, which are often in the red and which are financed by what are now the international main lines, and I am very concerned to see that this aspect of things has not really been taken into account. How are small railway lines, which are very useful, to be financed when the opening up to international competition is going to cause funding to dry up and the railway companies' margins to be reduced? That is a question that we must answer. We have until 2010, and I personally want the financing of public services and of budget headings relating to town and country planning to appear before long on the agenda of this House.

 Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, it is an honour for me to present to you my report on the certification of train drivers operating locomotives and trains on the railway system in the Community. I would like firstly to say that this is an exemplary issue, an extremely unusual one, because we are talking about the transposition into Community law of a sectoral social agreement, in this case a prior agreement between the European rail companies and rail employees. All of this is laid down in the texts but, generally speaking, in our certainty, we quite often avoid this agreement between the railwaymen and the bosses of the rail companies, or more generally between the employees and the management, when really we should stop avoiding it when everybody feels affected by a European project and a directive. I am one of those who believe that, in order to create the Europe of the railways that is so essential, the railway workers need to be in favour of that Europe and to have the conviction that, far from starting a kind of economic civil war amongst rail companies, its purpose is to develop the railways. The text presented is entirely exemplary. I would also say to Mr Jarzembowski, because we have always disagreed on this subject, that simply laying down dates for liberalisation is not sufficient to create a European internal market. This battle of dates is terribly restrictive. In order to create the internal market, we must first ensure that trains are interoperable, which requires considerable funding before anything else. In this regard, it seems to me that the liberalisation train is travelling much faster than the budget train or the interoperability train. Returning to the directive, it will have little impact on Great Britain because there is only one tunnel entering its territory and it has little in the way of land borders. It will not affect Spain very much because it has a different gauge of rails. It will not affect certain other countries that do not necessarily have direct rail borders with the Union: I am thinking of Finland and Greece. Liberalisation is therefore basically about interoperability, and my report relates to human interoperability, that is to say, the recognition of a train driver’s licence throughout the Union’s territory. I would like to thank the Members for doing such remarkable work. I would like to make the following comments with regard to the directive. First of all, we are talking about a licence for the whole of the network and not simply for the international network, since we believe that all train drivers should be able to aspire to move on to international level and that there is little difference between driving a TGV, a high-speed train, within one of the Member States and driving one that crosses the border. I believe that that is absolutely essential. Next, Parliament’s great contribution – which also led to a disagreement with the Council – is that we believe that crew members who carry out safety duties must be taken into account in a subsequent text, and we propose a road map. Lives are regularly saved by crew members who have learnt a number of tasks: the evacuation of trains, the protection of passengers, signalling, the activation of certain alarm circuits. It is entirely legitimate for these qualified people to be recognised and, above all, for us to attempt to harmonise their qualifications in all European countries in order to prevent any of them from being under-qualified. This is a safety issue and not just a social issue. Parliament has made a proposal on this subject, and we believe that it is very important to do so now: we are dealing with a world in which there is more than one rail company, and, since we are creating a Europe of railways, it is entirely legitimate to lay down rules on compensation that are applicable between rail companies when they exchange staff who they have trained. In other words, when a company spends a lot on training a driver and that driver leaves the company for another company within two years, we need minimum rules to oblige the company taking on that driver to partly repay the company that trained him. Since there is no railways university, training is currently provided by certain companies, principally the historic companies, and companies who are joining the market should not be able to benefit by becoming more competitive at less cost. Commissioner, I believe that the European Parliament's proposals are right. I am entirely aware of the disagreements that remain with the Council, in particular the ones I have just mentioned regarding the scope. Nevertheless, I believe that Parliament’s position is the right one. I would remind you that our fellow Members, from all political groups, voted unanimously in the Committee on Transport and Tourism. We therefore have a strong position, which we will uphold in conciliation, just as we will in relation to the other dossiers, such as that of Mr Jarzembowski. I understand that he is in favour of liberalisation, though I do not understand ... (The President asked the speaker to conclude)
 I simply wished to say ‘yes’ to liberalisation, provided that it is regulated and that public services are preserved.

Mr President, allow me first of all to thank all of my fellow Members, and in particular Mrs Weiler and Mr Langen, with whom we have done an outstanding piece of work. Let us hope that the text will be adopted tomorrow. It is quite simply a question of protecting the exercise of subsidiarity for PPPs, instruments that are very familiar to our local authorities, and have been for a great many years. I welcome the fact that the Commission plans to legislate on concessions, which have been mixed up for too long with public contracts. However, I shall state in this Chamber that I believe that legislation is also required for institutional public-private partnerships. It is wrong to say that these are recent entities: semi-public companies have been around since 1955 in France and the Stadtwerke 
have been around for a very long time in Germany. The fact is that subjecting them to two forms of competition today means putting an end to them. What private partner would agree to work with a local authority that makes it compete twice over? Furthermore, I would draw the Commissioner’s attention to the risk run by inter-communal structures, which are in danger of being mixed up with private structures even though they are an entirely public means of organisation for local authorities that aspire to be large enough to be able to fulfil increasingly demanding obligations and public-service missions.

 Mr President, I should like to explain why, after yesterday's very interesting debates and today's votes, I voted against Mr Rapkay's report: it is quite simply because I cannot help but observe that it is a resounding victory for the liberals. We voted for the deregulation of public services, against a framework directive, against the distinction between services of general economic interest and services of general interest, for the application of competition law to all services of general interest and their precise definition, against the definition of 'in-house', in other words state control, and against the specifics of the Altmark criteria. Under these circumstances, we are taking a considerable step backwards in comparison with the previous resolutions by Mr Herzog and Mr Langen in 2001, and the Commission is now proposing a new communication at the end of the year. In other words, we are currently leaving whole swathes of Community law and local public services exposed to the uncertainties of the Court. What is meant by State control? What is meant by inter-communal structure? What is meant by mixed-economy society? What concessions need to be made to market and competition law? We still do not know, and that is why I shall continue to advocate over-arching texts that enable us to put subsidiarity on a firmer footing. Unfortunately, I think that we are far from achieving that, and that it is now a losing battle. I hope that it is not a final defeat.

Mr President, I would confirm that linguistic difficulty. I would also like to say that 37 of us tabled Amendments 17 and 18 in plenary. Last night at the end of the debate an agreement was reached in relation to these amendments. I can tell the Members involved with these amendments that the Council and the Commission have agreed to include cabin crew in the air safety rules, as those Members wished. I can therefore say to the Members who have tabled these amendments together with me that, provided that the compromise amendments are adopted, our amendments will no longer be relevant and we will therefore be able to vote against. I believe that this has been a fine collective success. I hope that my fellow Members have understood what I wanted to say.

Mr President, Mr Barrot, we are coming to the end of a long - a very long – road for those who have been in Parliament since 1999. We have witnessed the very difficult development of this draft regulation, firstly with the report by Mr Simpson - who is not present in this Chamber, but to whom we must pay tribute - and then with the extremely careful and shrewd work of Mr Stockmann, who has made it possible today to conclude the regulation. I believe that Parliament, as you said, Commissioner, can pride itself on having given this draft regulation a respectable social complexion. As you said, the human factor has a major part to play in the field of air safety, as it often does elsewhere. One problem remained to be solved, which might have appeared of secondary importance: the human factor certainly refers to the flight deck crew, but it also refers to the cabin crew. We had difficulty in concluding because we wanted to settle the matter at the end of this second reading and not enter into a conciliation procedure. That is why 37 of us Members from different political backgrounds – I pay tribute to Mrs de Veyrac – acted in what may be regarded as an untimely fashion and tabled a number of amendments aimed at clearly and explicitly integrating subpart O into the scientific assessment and revision work. I believe that, thanks to Mr Stockmann’s mediation, these amendments finally convinced people that a compromise was possible and persuaded the Council to accept it without going any further. Consequently, if the compromise amendments, as they were drafted this week, are adopted – I am thinking of Amendments 22, 25 and 19 – then, in accordance with our Rules of Procedure, there is no longer any reason for us to vote in favour of the amendments tabled by 37 Members. That is therefore my wish, expressed with a sense of our having fulfilled our duty and of our having, in the course of this week, made some decisive progress. I am grateful to the Commission for its openness in this regard.

Mr President, Commissioner, I am a staunch partisan of the European rail system, the success of which depends on three things: interoperability, funding and opening rail networks to competition. In this report, the political centre of gravity tends to be the opening of networks to competition, in other words the market is paramount; whenever that is the case, road transport is always the winner. I believe we actually want to focus on interoperability and find a way to finance it. Moreover, the main issue at the present time concerning the introduction of ERTMS is how to fund it in such a way that the huge investment burden does not further handicap the railways in their efforts to compete with road transport. From this point of view, may I congratulate our honourable colleague, Mr Cramer, on his report. I am not sure that there was a need or obligation to assign priority to particular rail corridors. On the contrary, I believe it would have been better to say that, every time a network is upgraded or a new line is opened, it must be equipped to the new standard. I can scarcely imagine that any new line would not automatically be equipped in accordance with the new standard. There is also, of course, a crucial question with regard to funding during the transitional period when the old and new systems have to exist side by side. If this key question is not answered, national companies are liable to be wary. If it is answered, Commissioner, I believe we shall win the day, and we need to win, because each of the Thalys power cars, as you said, has seven different command and control systems installed, and they also cost 60% more than other locomotives.

Mr President, I should like to thank our rapporteur, Mr Gunnar Hökmark, and all of our fellow Members. We are in fact dealing here with a non-legislative report, and I believe that the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs has done a good job in terms of voicing the European Parliament’s strong position. On the whole, we have managed to end up with a fairly clear outlook on things. I am one of those who believe, along with the Socialist Group in the European Parliament, that we do in fact need to review the State aid system. This system is more than ever at the heart of the Commission’s powers, since Europe remains essentially a Europe of the internal market and competition until further notice. I am not sure whether the ‘No’ vote in the French referendum offers other prospects for the long-term future. We are therefore truly at the heart of Community powers here, and it is true that, with the enlargement of Europe, the European Union and the Commission are at risk of thrombosis if the State aid system and arrangements are left in their current state. Parliament has above all stressed that the internal market and competition should not be regarded as representing every aspect of European society. We are not just a market society; there must, as the texts stipulate, also be room for public action, not only on all those occasions when the market is failing, but also on all those occasions when we need to reduce social or territorial inequalities, manage external effects, promote innovation and, should the need arise, give a boost to industry. When, at times, we shift to a free market way of thinking, we sometimes find ourselves wondering: ‘Would we be in a position today to build the Airbus
 or would we be in a position to build the Ariane
 rocket, given the dominant ideology?’ I believe that we must retain this opportunity to intervene very forcefully in the industrial landscape and in public research. I should like to say to the Commissioner that the main contribution of Parliament is to ensure that State aid is not assessed as something merely to be borne but, rather, is assessed in a balanced way, that is to say that not only are the negative aspects, such as distortions of competition, considered, but so too are the positive effects. We, in the European Parliament, wanted the principles of subsidiarity and proportionality to be clearly applied and, more specifically, wanted State aid that has no obvious impact on the internal market to be considered as compensation. We also wanted market failures to be better understood. Finally, I should like to mention the issues that still need to be discussed and that are referred to in the 21 amendments tabled. With regard to public services, we need clarification on those aspects to do with compensation, with the legitimate funding of public services and with subsidiary funding and, above all, we need clarification on what constitutes the fourth criterion set out in the Altmark 
judgment, a criterion that, by the Commission’s own admission, is actually extremely vague and very difficult to handle. With regard to innovation, Mrs in 't Veld will soon present us with her report. We believe that it is a very good text and we hope to enhance it. The question that must be asked concerns the scope of the report: should it be strictly confined to innovation, or should it branch out a little further into the area of research and development? With regard to the regions, some excellent amendments are focused on preventing relocations from being funded by State aid. This is an extremely serious problem because it gives Europeans the impression that they are being pitted against one another, and this in terms, furthermore, of the amount received by way of public subsidies. Finally, I should like to conclude by saying that we are obviously totally in favour of State aid being considered in the framework of the Lisbon Process and the Gothenburg Process, that is to say not only in terms of the knowledge-based economy, but also in terms of helping the environment.

Mr President, the procedure advances far more quickly for texts relating to competition than for those relating to social standards – we are used to that. The text submitted to us today has been around since 2001. This is therefore the outcome of a long legislative procedure that ended with a difficult and improbable conciliation procedure, such was the resistance shown by the Member States. I will vote in favour of this text, which puts in place minimum standards. It must be pointed out that these standards constitute a significant step forward given that, in certain Member States, road transport workers were driving for as many as 70 or 74 hours and that driving times will from now on be limited to 56 hours; given that this is a text relating to social convergence, which does not prevent matters from being dealt with more satisfactorily in each of the Member States; and given that this is a text that I hope is ripe for improvement. Nevertheless, I very much regret what Mr Jarzembowski said about Mr Piecyk. He wanted to put a very unpleasant ideological slant on the matter. I regret it because Mr Piecyk put his finger on a problem: the absence of simultaneous checks of driving time and working time. Thus, a heavy goods vehicle could be kept moving non-stop by three underpaid drivers: the first drives, the second takes his rest break on the adjacent seat in the cab and the third takes his weekly rest break on the back seat, behind the driver. That is the reality of the matter, and I believe that we have let a great social text slip by. I regret that somewhat, but I will nevertheless be voting in favour.

Mr President, I will be very brief when I say that postal services are not like other services. They have a human dimension, as has been pointed out, but they also have a social and territorial dimension, which means that the services provided vary greatly from one country to the next. There is a big difference between serving a very dense population, like that of the Netherlands, which is concentrated on very flat territory, and serving, on the same terms, the same population spread over thousands of islands, as in Greece, or over a very diverse territory, as in France. Consequently, I hope that the assessment planned by the Commission is objective and that it is not based on the belief shared by some in this Assembly, namely that there is no need for a framework because the market, and nothing but the market as a whole, is equal to the job of regulating postal services. I also hope that this assessment helps ensure that the opening up of the postal market - which is something Europe needs – is carried out in such a way as to respect what the postal service represents: a universal service whose territorial and social dimension is irreplaceable.

Mr President, Commissioner, we have a slightly original debate in store for us tomorrow since the Committee on Transport and Tourism has done a procedural ‘u-turn’. We will therefore have to give our verdict on the raw text, that is to say on Mrs de Palacio’s ‘legacy’ text – the poisoned chalice she bestowed on the European Commission. Personally, I will be voting against it, not because – as everyone can confirm – I am particularly radical, but for three reasons. Firstly, I will be voting against the text because we do not have to accept a denial of parliamentary democracy. We cannot encourage the Commission to reproduce the same texts every time Parliament has voted against them, nor can we encourage it not to listen or to hear anything and to proceed on the basis of a mystical form of ultraliberalism that flouts everyone’s opinions, including those of the professionals. Secondly, I will be voting against it because this text is socially unacceptable and dangerous. It comes down to legalising the same kind of serfdom in the ports that is rife on the seas. Through self-handling by onboard personnel, it comes down to encouraging our ports to employ Filipinos and Malays in order to be competitive. In reality, it comes down to admitting that Irish Ferries 
was right in June. It is politically irresponsible because we withdrew a directive on crews, which was a social directive, and we are keeping the port services directive; because, in the context of the ‘better lawmaking’ initiative, we withdrew 60 European Parliament texts in the course of proceedings, yet we are keeping the port services directive; and because, in actual fact, this text gives food for thought and proves all the card-carrying Eurosceptics and those most fervently opposed to Europe, right. As someone who fought to see Europe exist, I, for my part, believe that this is an insult to us. Commissioner, I know what your feelings are and I think that the problems related to Europe’s ports are problems to do with the excessive concentration in the North Sea, with saturation, with the disorganisation of road traffic flows on the continent, with the security of the straits – one can see what took place again in the Pas-de-Calais – and with national and regional development. A port is primarily a site. It is a strategic site; it is not a free-for-all service; it is not a supermarket. You need to think along these lines in future when you design the new initiative. (Applause from the left)

 Madam President, Commissioner, I would first like to thank Mrs Wortmann-Kool for her dedicated and remarkable work. I will be voting in favour of this text tomorrow, albeit with some reluctance. We are in fact talking about the financing of our ambitions, which appear in the 2001 White Paper and are meant to stabilise transport’s modal shares or even to finance alternative modes of transport. Those considerable ambitions were expressed in the 30 priority projects. We now know, however, that the TEN budget will not be as much as the Commission is asking for to finance the large-scale projects. We might have expected the ‘Eurovignette’ directive to be much more ambitious. Unfortunately, it, too, is a subsidiary tool. Member States who do not want to apply it will not be required to do so. It is also a tool designed mainly to use road transport to finance road transport. It would only finance other modes of transport occasionally. I am very much afraid that, in order to reach a compromise – and we should perhaps have used the conciliation procedure – the European Parliament will drop some of its ambitions tomorrow, that it will not be firm enough on external costs and in particular on the sunset clause that Mr El Khadraoui has tabled in an amendment. That means that if the Commission and the Member States fail to propose a directive within the time required, the automatic clause will apply.

Mr President, some of us in this Parliament have lived through the dreadful experience of the Erika
 and Prestige
 maritime disasters and have witnessed the lamentable spectacle of the Member States pushing aside the European Union. For once, in the field of air safety, Europe has had a head start on events – I do not know whether we should be delighting in this, however, unfortunately – since we created the European Aviation Safety Agency in 2002 and the Commission proposed this regulation to us back in February, before the tragic summer we have experienced. I would therefore like to thank Mrs de Veyrac for the work she has done, since Parliament has considerably improved the text. For a long time it has vacillated between subsidiarity and Community added value. We are seeing genuine Community added value today since we have a Community blacklist, each Member State’s list will be distributed amongst all of the other Member States, and the European Union and the Commission have their degree of autonomy. This text therefore goes a long way. I would like to hark back to the maritime field. It has taught us that it was not a question of carrying out inspections. It is a question of knowing how frequent those inspections should be. It is also a question of knowing who is responsible. We have done this in the maritime field, and tomorrow we will probably have to do so for air transport. Finally, as you know, Commissioner, the human factor is very important in air accidents. The majority of them are the result of human failings. It is therefore very important that we provide for rules relating to the monitoring of the training of crews and a very high level of training that is harmonised at European level. You have opened up the door by extending the competences of the European Aviation Safety Agency. I understand the Council’s reservations. I believe that you will have the support of Parliament, Commissioner, since this is the direction we must take if we are to take on our responsibilities towards the public and the users of air transport.

Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, I would like to begin by congratulating the rapporteur, Mr Mauro, as well as Mr Bösch, who has been of great assistance to us in this work. I am speaking on behalf of the Committee on Transport and Tourism and I would like to say that this regulation is long awaited. It contains many innovations for better managing the funds that are going to be invested in the trans-European transport networks, such as multi-annual programming, which is necessary and which is attached to each project, automatic decommitment, so that the funds do not remain unused indefinitely, the increase in rates of intervention, the establishment of European coordinators or the new loan guarantee instrument. This is therefore a regulation of very high quality, but it contains a significant mistake: we have considerably increased the rates of intervention, we have considerably extended the geographical scope of the trans-European networks, we have doubled the number of priority projects, and we do not yet have any budget! In other words, though we now have the key to the coffers, the coffers are empty. I believe that we must avoid the loss of credibility that we suffered in relation to the big Essen projects. I therefore believe that it is extremely important that we pursue the budgetary battle to its end, because otherwise we will suffer a very considerable loss of credibility, which would be a very great disappointment for all of the regions of Europe. Furthermore, it seems to me that the spending adjustment variable is what are being called projects of common interest, which are not priority projects. In this regard as well, I fear that many regions and many local authorities in Europe are deluding themselves. The regulation is deceptive: it says that it funds everything, not just priority projects, but also projects of common interest within countries. We are very well aware, though, that we do not have the resources for that and that we will focus solely on cross-border projects and the big priority projects. I therefore believe, Commissioner, that it needs to be put differently. In the absence of the resources to cover everything, we must explain that we will intervene wherever there is Community added value, that is to say, essentially the great cross-border projects.

 Mr President, Commissioner, I should first like to thank the chairman of our committee, Paolo Costa, and all of our colleagues, be they rapporteurs – one of whom has just spoken – shadow rapporteurs or coordinators, for the very intensive and quite remarkable work that they have done on behalf of the European Parliament. I listened carefully to Mr Jarzembowski, who mentioned a Frenchman who was, he said, hostile to the package. I do not know whom he meant. No doubt he knows this man. In any case I do not. That is why I have argued strongly that we should vote on all of the texts today and forward them to the Council. Parliament has done its work and the package is ready. We will forward it to the UK Presidency tomorrow and I hope moreover that the UK Presidency will make a decision, so that if possible – although we should perhaps not be too idealistic – this complicated dossier can be completed under Mr Blair’s Presidency. The package is moving forward: I simply wanted us to put it to the vote today and not defer the work that has been done by the European Parliament. There is no reason to do so, because there is at least one text that is rather urgent and that is the text on the licence for train drivers. This is not because it was the subject of fairly broad agreement in the Committee on Transport and Tourism, but quite simply because liberalisation is underway. The international rail freight market has been open since 15 March 2003 and we need this text today to ensure that drivers operating international rail transport services are properly trained. I would add in respect of my own report that it is quite exemplary and I hope that the message that we in Parliament send out tomorrow will be equally so. Why is it exemplary? Firstly, because it sends out a social signal, when until now we have essentially sent out economic or liberalisation signals. I have always argued here that rail transport should be a matter for everyone, including railway workers, and I do not think that this initiative will be successful if those who work on the railways feel that the European rail system is no concern of theirs. We have set up a Railway Agency, in which we are going to involve the social partners; we need to ensure that the social partners feel that they have a stake in the investment that we are all making in the future of rail transport. That is why we need to take this text, which has been agreed by both sides of industry, by the employers and the unions – which is very rare at European level – and today enshrine it in legislation. It is an exercise – a fairly straightforward one at the end of the day, because the work has been done – that consists of transposing a historic, social agreement into substantive European law, an agreement that calls for others, perhaps one day collective agreements enabling railway workers to feel that they all have a stake in opening up rail networks. That is why I will take the liberty of asking for as broad an agreement as possible on my report tomorrow, a report to which the committee has made many improvements, which may appear trivial, but which are actually important. Firstly, we have extended it. We think that in the long term all workers on all of the networks should, if they so wish, have an international driver’s licence. Every national driver has a right to become an international driver if he so wishes. We also wanted to clarify the text. We have clearly stated the definitions of drivers and train crews, in the case of the latter referring to a forthcoming proposal from the Commission, to be based on work done by the Agency, which will be carried out openly and in consultation with stakeholders. We have also made the text more precise in terms of training, in terms of the benefits that each worker gains from his experience and in terms of how the training is financed, given that some drivers that have been trained by one railway undertaking may subsequently move to another. Finally, we have made the dates more consistent and have brought forward the date of transposition. That is the basic substance of the report that our committee is proposing to you. I should now like to make a few final comments on the other texts. I think that Mr Sterckx’s report on passenger rights is absolutely essential. There is no reason to establish passenger rights in air transport and not in rail transport. Moreover, given that there are significant disparities between the Member States and also problems with the system, in particular in my own country, I am pleased that Mr Sterckx is tabling a report along these lines and I hope that the opposition in the Council will be overcome. When it comes to Mr Zīle’s report, without wishing to offend the rapporteur, who has done an excellent job, I am of course more cautious, quite simply because the railway undertakings value the contractual relationship and goods are a great deal more heterogeneous than passengers. Transporting one kind of merchandise can be very different from transporting another. Finally I turn to Mr Jarzembowski’s report, and here I am personally more cautious. I voted in favour of liberalising the freight market because freight was not working. When it comes to passenger transport, it seems to me that this is all about a few large companies coveting the national networks. It is cabotage that troubles me more than anything else. We all know full well that in reality there is no market for services from Paris to Rome. However, there is a market between Paris and Lyon and between Lyon and Marseilles, and that is what the large companies are eyeing up. I am concerned about the small countries, countries of limited size, whose national lines are actually on international lines that might disappear tomorrow or be absorbed by large operators like SNCF or Deutsche Bahn. Moreover, that is precisely why these large companies are so interested. I should like, in conclusion, to say that, as I see it, if we think in terms of transport markets – and no one has denied this for the last ten years – it is road that wins. We have to think in terms of transport policy and the essential factor is not simply competition within the rail sector, which is the objective that we have been pursuing obsessively for years, but providing the conditions to enable there to be competition between road and the other modes of transport. Until we have settled this point rail will decline, as it is declining today for open freight.

Mr President, I would like to congratulate and thank all the Members who have been involved in the drawing up of this resolution. This is unfortunately not the first and probably will not be the last. I hope, however, that it will be followed up. I personally have voted for it because it contains a paragraph 12 which addresses the Commission and asks it to take full account of the need to fund measures for preventing forest fires. In 1992, there was a regulation. This regulation was abolished in 2003 in favour of Forest Focus, which is currently provided with EUR 61 million for ecological protection programmes and only EUR 9 million for the fight against fires. I myself come from a forest region and I must tell you that the foresters regret this situation, since the funding is necessary for the creation of firebreaks, equipment and monitoring and control systems which are very effective in terms of preventing forest fires. I therefore hope that the Commission will take full account of this resolution and that it will give back the prevention of forest fires and the creation of preventive systems the place they deserve within our budget. Otherwise we will unfortunately be obliged to admit that our compassion is often short-lived.

Madam President, I should like to express my satisfaction at the rejection of this common position, having failed to achieve anything better – in other words, having failed to be able to approve Mr Rocard's amendments one by one, which were intended to bring us back to the first reading by the European Parliament. Like my fellow Members, I do not believe it perpetuates legal uncertainty, because a lot has happened in the last three years. At first reading, the European Parliament adopted an unambiguous wording. Today it has just rejected the patentability of software programs. I believe we should stick to that and revert to the wording of Article 52 of the Munich European Convention because, in reality, it was not so much a question of confirming the patentability of software programs but rather of an offensive aimed at making them patentable. This offensive has been halted today in a major victory for European parliamentary democracy over the lobbies and over the Commission’s manoeuvring.

 Mr President, Commissioner, I would like first to congratulate Mr Schmitt on the extremely full and balanced nature of his work. At last we have a text of very great quality, and the work of amendment done in committee makes an important parliamentary contribution. It is a text that flows naturally from the work we did during the last parliamentary term, that is to say on the establishment of the single European sky, and this social dimension was absolutely essential because we are dealing with a public safety service that is first of all a manpower service. The quality of air traffic control and of air navigation depends on the men and their qualifications, and its quality is of course its high level of safety. I believe the text meets all these requirements. I do not know what the outcome of the vote will be tomorrow, but it seems to me that it represents rather the anti-Bolkestein approach. It is an exercise in Community regulation. It is an exercise in harmonised regulation. It is an exercise in mutual recognition, with extremely detailed work on certification, endorsements and mutual recognition. From that point of view, I am very pleased with it. From this perspective, Amendment 20, which wants it made clear that air traffic controllers will be subject to the social jurisdiction of the country where they work, is quite crucial. It will be the explicit confirmation of what we all want, that is to say harmonisation, not social dumping. Secondly, we are again presenting Amendment 22 on the sectoral social dialogue. I know that some of our fellow Members say that goes without saying. However, we think it is even better to say it, especially since the Single Sky Committee has not agreed to include workers’ representatives, which is quite crucial for the quality of the service in this field.

 Mr President, we are in the habit of making a lot of noise when it comes to the explanations of vote. I would simply like to say that I welcome the adoption of the Wortmann-Kool report, which is probably one of the most remarkable legislative acts of the European Union in recent years. Here in this House, in the presence of Commissioner Loyola de Palacio, following the Erika I and Erika II maritime packages, I called for the creation of a European maritime safety zone. If ever it materialises, it will have a legal basis and it will be ambitious. Never has the European Union gone so far in imposing sanctions of the most severe kind, in other words criminal sanctions, on the pirates of the seas who blight our coastlines and who very often devastate entire livelihoods as well as the flora and fauna of coastal areas. I believe we should be very pleased with the considerable progress which has been made, and hope that the Council will now follow it up. From now on, no one will be able to put the blame on the European Union, as we witnessed in the case of the Erika
 and that of the Prestige
. Member States are now facing up to their responsibilities. Personally, I would like them to accept those responsibilities fully, because Europe is not only defending itself in this way against maritime pollution, but also sending out an international message which is even bolder than the MARPOL legislation, and it is in a position to change, throughout the world, the legislation against pollution and against the pirates of the seas. I should like to finish by expressing a hope, the hope that the legislation we adopted to prevent the dumping of fuel waste at sea will be revised with the same degree of ambition. In my opinion, the only solution is to equip our ports with free fuel-discharge facilities, because with this kind of dumping, as you know, it is naturally difficult to catch the perpetrators, who generally operate at night in foggy weather. I believe, therefore, that we ought to set up a system like the one used for disposing of household waste, with a port tax and port discharge facilities, thereby making it possible for all vessels to discharge fuel waste in purpose-built facilities in all European ports. If we make this additional progress, I think that we shall then be the world leaders in safety and sanctions against pollution. (Applause)

 Mr President, there is no objection over the substance, but I should not like there to be any confusion over the facts. This oral amendment is tabled four times: it relates to Amendment 20, Amendment 19, Amendment 21 and Amendment 15. In order to avoid any ambiguity, I would suggest, Mr President, that, each time we vote on these amendments, you indicate that they are amendments that form part of Mr Purvis’s oral amendment. I feel that this would clear up any potential confusion. Mr Purvis’s oral amendment relates to four amendments. If you would be kind enough to remind us of Mr Purvis’s oral amendment at each vote, I believe that it would be clearer for the House.

Mr President, I do not wish to complicate matters, but Mrs in 't Veld is asking us to vote once and for all on Mr Purvis’ amendment. You will not know where it will be in the text, but it will be there. Quite frankly, as there are four crucial amendments, Amendments 20, 19, 21 and 15, I would prefer it if we were asked each time whether we were adopting them subject to the oral amendment by Mr Purvis. I think that would be clearer. I understand what Mrs in 't Veld is saying, but I would like her to tell me exactly where she is going to put Mr Purvis’ amendment, as she has said that it appears throughout the text. I think this is confused and I do not want us to make a mistake with this vote, because, as you said yourself, this is a sensitive text.

Mr President, Commissioner, for a long time I was among those who believed that the only type of bureaucracy was state bureaucracy. Now, though, as an MEP, I have discovered an inextricably linked market bureaucracy: State aid. I believe that the proposal put to us today constitutes real progress, namely – as you just said during the previous debate, Commissioner – the exemption from the notification requirement of minor aid that is not considered to have an impact on the single market. In my opinion, this is a considerable step forwards. We need to consolidate this, and it would also be worthwhile to definitively rename it public service compensation, rather than State aid. This is a new legal category that could be created. With regard to the report that has been presented to us, I am one of those who believe that there are things that need to be stabilised. In particular, I do not think that we can vote again as we did in committee: hospitals and social housing must be clearly integrated in the scope. This, though, is probably not enough. I am one of those who suggest that there should also be autonomous services within local communities, which other texts are in the process of recognising, in particular the regulation on the public service obligation in transport. We will probably have to wait for the Commission's communication on social services in order to be able, maybe tomorrow, to include these in this text. Finally, I think we need to consider the issue of the fourth criterion from the Altmark ruling. This criterion is so complicated that it would introduce to this document – which is a simplifying document – new complications for local communities. As you know, it involves comparison with the reasonable profit of a comparable undertaking at EU level. This is absolutely impracticable. Consequently, perhaps this fourth criterion could at some point be abandoned, even at the risk of slight overcompensation, so that your aim of simplification can finally be pursued and achieved.

 Mr President, I should like to express, over and above the shock we all felt confronted with the huge suffering caused in the Indian Ocean by the disastrous tidal wave experienced at the end of last year, the unease we felt at seeing the development of a diplomacy of compassion that was naturally not devoid of ulterior motives on the part of the nations concerned. I am consequently very pleased that, in the resolution adopted by the European Parliament, we were considering arranging for a European Civil Protection Corps to be put in place, with the task of putting together another form of aid, free from the ulterior motives described and, especially, from the competition we have witnessed in the charitable and emergency relief stakes. In view of this, I should like us to do more to make use of the enhanced cooperation mechanism put in place on 23 October 2001 by creating a genuine European civil protection headquarters capable of training experts and sending them out in the colours of the European Union so that the EU might physically demonstrate its commitment in periods of emergency and reconstruction. I should also like us to take account of this within the framework of the Financial Perspectives adopted, given that the Solidarity Fund notoriously lacks the flexibility not only for mobilising the necessary help in transporting resources but also for channelling the emergency aid that presupposes completely mobile and available funds. I was expressing myself along these lines as early as 1999. I welcome the efforts successfully made by the Commission and the Council, and I hope that Europe will very quickly have available to it helmets painted with the blue of the European flag and signalling emergency aid.

 Mr President, when I voted in favour of the Corbett report, it was not because I thought the Constitution was the end of the story. At the same time, however, I did not think it was the result of chance. What firstly crossed my mind were the lengthy struggles that preceded the 1949 European Convention on Human Rights and the 1961 European Social Charter, with the latter being backed by all the trade unions. These have now borne fruit in the shape of Part Two of the Constitutional Treaty, which contains the Charter of Fundamental Rights. Above all, however, my thoughts turned to the real father of the Constitution, Altiero Spinelli, whose name is not mentioned nearly enough. Spinelli, a member of the Communist Youth who was put under house arrest for ten years by Mussolini, anticipated today’s text right from the European Parliament’s first term as a directly-elected body. Another name to cross my mind was that of Mr Duhamel, who during the last parliamentary term prompted us to hold a public Convention in order to draft this Constitutional Treaty. I therefore came to the conclusion that, as a left-winger, I could lend my support to this draft Constitutional Treaty today without any qualms, as it will open a promising page in the history of the EU.

 Mr President, I should like to join in the chorus of praise for the Irish Presidency, which has proved that when there is great European inspiration there are no small countries. On a more specific point, and speaking as a member of the Committee on Regional Policy, Transport and Tourism, I should also like to congratulate the Irish Presidency on three of its very important achievements. The first of these is the adoption of the second railways package, the second is the adoption of a very ambitious programme of trans-European transport networks, and the third is the constellation of navigation satellites forming Galileo, the European Global Positioning System. I should like to take this opportunity to congratulate all the Irish negotiators, who showed great savoir-faire and very great skill. When anyone exercises responsibility, however, there are always grey areas and there are failures. I should like to mention two of them, and to associate myself with all that has been said here about the agreement with the United States on personal data in relation to transatlantic air safety. This agreement is not in line with what Parliament wanted. It is a denial of democracy and we cannot accept it. This agreement represents a risk to human rights and is a manifestation of Europe’s servility towards the United States at a time when the United States is not demonstrating very much openness in relation to human rights and the protection of citizens. In some respects it is contrary to the elementary requirements and the ideals of our European project. Nevertheless I welcome the fact that it was an Irishman, Mr Pat Cox, who tried to expunge this affront to the European Parliament by initiating proceedings before the European Court of Justice. The second great disappointment is the decision of the ‘competitiveness’ Council to go back on this House’s vote at first reading on the patentability of software. It is unfortunate that you chose to go back on a text which is a credit to the European Parliament, striking, as it in one sense did, a miraculous balance between protecting our industry and guaranteeing the universality of the language of software and the freedom of access to it. I think that this is a great pity. The ball is, admittedly, in Parliament’s court, but the option chosen is the result of an extremely narrow conception of property and the weight of the industrial lobbies. In all, your Presidency will be remembered as being a great technical presidency but as being slightly less successful as regards social matters, and this is something that is regrettable.

 I voted in favour of Amendment 138, which I tabled in September last year and which was adopted by 88% of MEPs. I am pleased that it has again been upheld by an overwhelming majority of Members, who have thus reaffirmed their commitment to defending the rights of Internet users. One month from the European elections, that is a strong sign. Contrary to what the UMP and its minister of culture seem to think, the European Parliament’s opinion does matter. This is another blow to Sarkozy and the French Government: Parliament has said ‘no’ to Sarkozy on both form and content. MEPs have said ‘no’ to the flexible response and ‘no’ to the inadmissible pressure exerted by France on the primary democratic body of the European continent!

 I voted in favour of this report, presented by my British fellow Member of the Socialist Group in the European Parliament, Mr Corbett, on the general revision of Parliament’s Rules of Procedure. I support the initiative by the Socialist Group President, Mr Schulz, who sought to use this revision to prevent the French leader of an extreme-right party from having the honour of chairing the inaugural session of the new parliament. Under the new provisions, Parliament’s inaugural session, to be held on 14 July, will be chaired by the outgoing president, if he is re-elected, or by one of the 14 vice-presidents in order of precedence if re-elected. European democracy in fact holds principles of respect and tolerance among peoples that Mr Le Pen wilfully disregards through his determination to make revisionist remarks.

I voted against the report by my Greek fellow Member from the Group of the European People’s Party (Christian Democrats) and European Democrats, Mrs Panayotopoulos-Cassiotou, on the organisation of the working time of persons performing mobile road transport activities. My vote was motivated by the fact that this report, which is aimed at organising the working time of persons performing mobile road transport activities, would have actually had the effect of excluding self­employed drivers from the scope of European legislation on the organisation of working time. My socialist colleagues and I share the view that we cannot accept two-speed social legislation: legislation that protects some but that leaves hauliers by the wayside. Adopting the Commission’s proposal would have meant that self-employed drivers were unacceptably discriminated against when compared with employed drivers, who are protected by European legislation. Parliament has taken note of our reservations. It now falls to the soon-to-be-elected Parliament to give its verdict during the new parliamentary term.

 I voted in favour of this joint resolution concerning the future of the automotive industry. This text emphasises the need to define at European level a clear and coherent policy to cope with a crisis that is affecting all of the Member States of the EU. In fact, it is estimated that 12 million jobs in Europe are directly or indirectly affected by the automotive industry. Sales are down, stocks are increasing, and redundancy announcements are multiplying. There are no miracle cures for the social disaster that is emerging; only coordinated measures will be able to save the sector. That is why I voted in favour of this joint resolution, which calls on the European authorities to work with the Member States to introduce measures that will make it possible to ensure the future competitiveness of the European automotive industry and continued employment in the sector. However, the resolution has come a little late and does not meet all expectations. The debate is therefore far from being over and promises to be lively, especially if one considers the current social issues at stake and the reaffirmed need for a social Europe that protects its citizens.

 I voted in favour of the report on the performance and sustainability of the European aviation system, presented by my Romanian fellow Member Mr Marinescu. This text is part of the ‘Single Sky II’ package and aims to improve the performance of the European aviation system. It makes it possible to respond to several concerns: environmental concerns, through the implementation of measures enabling a reduction in CO2
 emissions; operational concerns, as it aims to rationalise air traffic by means of increased capacities and optimal planning of air routes; and, finally, concerns for the safety of the European public, by calling for cooperation and coordination between the various actors. Following the ‘Single Sky I’ package, this report has the merit of presenting a dynamic vision of the current challenges by proposing long-term solutions for the effective modification of the aviation sector.

 I voted in favour of this recommendation, presented by a British member of the Group of the Alliance of Liberals and Democrats for Europe, Baroness Ludford, on Common Consular Instructions: biometric identifiers and visa applications. This agreement at second reading enables us to confirm our will to introduce biometric data into the European visa information system. Thanks to the Common Consular Instructions, we finally have a guarantee that all the Member States will issue visas to the nationals of almost 100 countries, on the basis of similar criteria and characteristics. This text therefore has the merit of introducing fundamental measures for the protection of European citizens, as well as provisions that ensure respect for private life and for the personal data of third-country nationals.

I voted in favour of this report by the Czech Member of the Confederal Group of the European United Left – Nordic Green Left, Jaromír Kohlíček, on the investigation of accidents in the maritime transport sector. This text emphasises the need to draw up, at European level, clear and binding guidelines to ensure that accidents at sea are monitored properly. It addresses the concerns that followed the sinking of the Erika 
oil tanker off the French coast. It is in order to prevent a repeat of such cases of mismanagement that the European Union has decided to impose a strict framework that deals with all the technical aspects and all the processes to be followed in the event of an accident: methodology of the investigations, a European database for marine casualties, safety recommendations, and so on. I share the view that it is crucial to make the European maritime area one of the safest and most exemplary maritime areas in the world. This is what the ‘Erika 
III’ maritime package, of which the report forms part, is working towards. This is a real breakthrough for the maritime sector, and also for the environment, which is often a secondary victim of disrespectful conduct at sea.

I voted in favour of this own-initiative report by the Italian Member of the Confederal Group of the European United Left – Nordic Green Left, Giusto Catania, on the future of the European Common Asylum System. The text of this report focuses on the situation of asylum seekers, whose fate is really something of a lottery depending on the country in which they land, and whose detention conditions are, at times, only just about bearable. This is a situation that affects border countries in particular, but which needs to be taken into account at European level. The fundamental rights of asylum seekers are at stake, as is the ability of certain countries to cope with these migratory pressures. This is a joint responsibility. This report has the merit of providing a clear account of the situation and of specifying the challenges to come for the European Union in the context of this debate. Through this vote, I am joining the French socialists in denouncing a situation which is no longer acceptable and which Europe, as a democratic institution and human rights protector, must remedy.

I voted against this report, presented by the French Christian Democrat, Mr Vatanen. The text of this report relates to the role of NATO in the security architecture of the European Union. It is an important issue that needs to be considered. In my opinion, however, the answers given in this report were not good ones and they left the root of the problem unresolved. By my vote, I certainly did not wish to deny the role that Europe has to play internationally. As an economic and demographic power, it is expected to act according to its values and must do so in order to maintain peace and intercultural dialogue. Strengthening the European Union’s military credibility is, however, indispensable. That is why I am emphasising my commitment to creating a European security and defence policy that has real autonomy. In my opinion, this is not what Mr Vatanen’s report promises. Some stumbling blocks remain, in particular concerning denuclearisation and relations with Russia. The number of amendments tabled proves it (265): the text of the report was far from achieving unanimous approval. It does not address the main concern which is to ensure that Europe has a strong defence and cooperates with NATO, but is not subservient to it.

 I voted in favour of this resolution on the return and reintegration of detainees from the Guantánamo detention centre. It seems to me that Europe can only congratulate President Obama on his decision to close the detention centre, something that many of us have been demanding for several years. Therefore, this seems to me to be a good opportunity to respond to the request of the USA by putting forward a common position in line with the values of the European Union. It is essential that we are also able to put our own house in order within our own borders and that the European countries that have allowed the CIA to covertly transfer prisoners are in turn made aware of their responsibilities.

I voted in favour of the Fava report on the draft directive on sanctions against employers of illegal immigrants. According to the Commission’s figures, between 4.5 and 8 million third-party nationals are living illegally within the European Union and are therefore the favoured targets of unscrupulous employers benefiting from illegal labour. It is imperative for us to highlight these practices, which are unworthy of a Europe where respect for basic human rights should apply to everyone. The time has finally come to emphasise the responsibility of those who profit from these particularly vulnerable people. We must stop criminalising these victims by stigmatising illegal immigrants. With regard to the measures we are advocating here, it is not only a question of penalising dishonest bosses but also of defending a specific number of social rights such as the right to be represented by a trade union. However, we should not cry victory too soon because the threat of sanctions is not enough, rather we must have the necessary legal control instruments in place. Only then will we be able to implement an effective common immigration policy.

 Mr President, the report I am presenting follows on from the request made by Mrs Trüpel - who is here today and whom I welcome - and I, at the time of the 2007 Culture report three years ago, for greater recognition of the cultural industries, which I recall are now larger than the automotive industry in the European Union, accounting for 3.1% of the active population of the European Union and generating 2.6% of GDP. I have therefore prepared this report by consulting as much as possible with all those involved in the sector. Consequently I would like to thank all the experts and professionals from the industry, as well as web user and consumer associations and finally my colleagues in the Committee on Culture for all the discussions we have been able to hold on these crucial issues. This report is based on the following postulate: culture and the economy have today become inseparable. The economy needs culture and culture needs the economy. In view of this, culture urgently needs to be restored to its rightful place on the Lisbon agenda. With this in mind, I make a number of proposals in this report. The first would be to set up a task force to explore the relationship between culture, creativity and innovation in the context of Community policies. Secondly, it is essential make more room in our Community funding for the cultural industries. In this report, at the level of the Member States I recommend private/public funding as well as the promotion of a regulatory and fiscal framework that favours cultural industries, and more specifically the application of tax credits and reduced rates of VAT to all cultural products, including online works. I also call upon the Commission to look into the possibility of setting up a programme similar to the MEDIA programme for all the cultural industries. Thirdly, this report proposes that culture be better incorporated into the European Union’s external policies because – and I want to stress this – what makes Europe so rich is its culture or rather, as I should have said, the diversity of its culture. I therefore invite the Commission and the Member States to increase the amount of aid for translation. Finally, if you will allow me Mr President, I would like to return to the issue of intellectual property rights, which are the subject of a great number of amendments in this report. On this subject, I strongly oppose the position of some Member States whose repressive measures are dictated by industries incapable of changing their economic model in line with the needs imposed by the information society. Cutting off internet access is a disproportionate measure in view of the objectives. This is a penalty with powerful effects, which could have serious repercussions in a society where internet access is essential for social inclusion. Ladies and gentlemen, I think we need to make a distinction between mass piracy and consumers acting without a profit motive. Rather than criminalising consumers, we need to set up new economic models that strike a balance between the ability to access cultural activities and content, cultural diversity and genuine remuneration for those who hold intellectual property rights. It seems to me that this is the only way cultural Europe can truly enter the 21st
 century.

 Madam President, Commissioner, I think we should not forget what we are trying to achieve. Despite what some subjective studies would have us believe, it is not the 13% of Europeans downloading cultural content illegally who are threatening our culture, but it seems to me that it is the concentration of our culture in the hands of a few large groups that is damaging our diversity and therefore the richness of our cultural heritage. I will only give you one example, that of records. Today, 95% of what is distributed comes from the four big record companies. I believe it is important to ensure that consumers have genuine choice and it is necessary to guarantee pluralism of content in a very concentrated market where those chiefly responsible for innovation and creativity are small, not big. You were talking about SMEs, Commissioner, recommending a study which I think is a really interesting idea. The permission for a merger between Sony and BMG granted by the Commission totally contradicts the European policy to support SMEs in the music industry, which create more jobs than the large companies and represent 99% of the market players and 80% of innovation in this sector. It seems, therefore, that there is an urgent need to support diversity in the cultural sector, which is a genuine driver of growth and a means of development for individuals. In conclusion, I will say that it is the diversity of culture that makes it rich and not the other way around.

Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, allow me first of all to thank the rapporteur, Mr Belet, for having sought to reach a compromise among the various committees and political groups of our Parliament. However, I should like straightaway to say how hugely disappointed I am. We have reached a compromise between the groups, not least between the Socialist Group in the European Parliament and the Group of the European People’s Party (Christian Democrats) and European Democrats. This compromise was voted on in committee, and here we find, today, that crucial points have been amended, namely the independent regulating body and the legal status of sports companies. This report will not mark the start of a new era for football in Europe, and I deeply regret it. Nevertheless, I hope that it can establish a form of cooperation between UEFA and the European Union with the aim of cleaning up as much as possible the world of football, for, as the UEFA President, Michel Plattini, pointed out, football is a game before a product, a sport before a market and a form of entertainment before a business. Ladies and gentlemen, the deregulation that resulted from the Bosman ruling must be counterbalanced today by clear rules, in an effort to restore true values to the EU’s top sport. The European football authorities do not have all the guarantees necessary to be able to regulate in a truly satisfactory fashion. Aside from their limited legal rights, they are both the judge and the ones being judged. They act as both commercial operator and regulator, functions that are difficult to reconcile. On this point, as I indicated at the start of my speech, it is regrettable that the PPE-DE and the Group of the Alliance of Liberals and Democrats for Europe should not have endorsed my twin proposal, namely the creation of a European legal statute for sports companies and the implementation of an independent body in charge of monitoring the top clubs, the main task of which would be to ensure that the financial, economic and sporting balance of football in Europe is preserved. I hope, however, that the European Commission will take due note of these proposals, which are meant not only as a defence against the current excesses, but also as an instrument for promoting a fair and united European sporting model. At a time when we are celebrating the 50th anniversary of the Treaty of Rome, Europe must show its citizens that it remains for them not just a vehicle for peace and democracy, but above all a vehicle for protecting them against the excesses of all-out liberalism. It is on this condition alone that Europeans are proud to participate in this great project that is European integration.

Mr President, speaking on behalf of the Socialist Group in the European Parliament on the draft report concerning the White Paper on a European communication policy, I should like to say straight away, as Mr Onesta did before me, that I welcome the overdue recognition of communication as a two-way process between the institutions and the people, and no longer as a mere marketing operation. There is still, however, a long way to go to the establishment a European communication system in which European affairs are part and parcel of the public domain at the national level. What I said in committee I shall repeat here: I regret that the White Paper continues to overrate new technology and to underrate national television services. We know, and Eurobarometer surveys confirm, that the mainstream national channels remain the favourite information source of the EU population. It seems to me that we must act accordingly. Furthermore, the White Paper remains strangely silent on the subject of financial resources. As we all know, democracy, and hence communication, come at a price. As long as the Union's multiannual budget is lower than the budget of a European advertising agency, little effective progress can be made. I would like to congratulate the rapporteur, Mr Herrero, of course, and to say to him that the debate on Article 308 is not closed and that Mrs Prets will return to the problem shortly. Commissioner, it is a sad fact that the Commission only ever talks about communication policy when Europe is in crisis. It is only when things are going badly that the Commission feels the need to communicate. The question that must be put to the Commission concerns the actual content of its communications. People see the Commission as an ultraliberal body with no interest in protecting European citizens from the storm winds of globalisation. We owe it to our citizens, and to democracy, to provide a better explanation of what happens in Brussels. Most of Europe's citizens are unaware of the achievements that have been made possible by the policies and financial resources of the European Union. What is more, they are too often unaware that every decision in Brussels emanates from the will of the Member States. If electricity, gas, rail transport and now postal services have been liberalised, it is because the Member States wanted them to be liberalised. Without the will of the Member States, these things would not have been done. In conclusion, I believe that what we need is not so much a code of conduct for the European institutions on communication with the public as a code of conduct for the Commission to ensure that it pursues policies that are more in tune with people's concerns. Lastly, we need a general code of conduct to apply to the Member States so that they assume their responsibilities and put a stop, once and for all, to the practice of ascribing European successes to national policies and national failures to the Community. That would raise Europe's stock.

 Mr President, allow me to start by congratulating the rapporteur, Mr Graça Moura, on the work he has done on the fundamental topic of the Culture 2007 programme and, in particular, on the agreement he has reached on behalf of the European Parliament. I would like briefly to go over the three points that I championed for the Socialist Group in the European Parliament within the Committee on Culture and Education. Firstly, with regard to the transversal aspect of the programme, it must be noted that the agreement reached goes in the right direction: nobody can object to increasing the coherence of the programme, which will make it possible to put a stop to the fragmentation that for a long time has characterised the European Union's cultural activities. However, intentions are one thing, and the resources proposed are quite another. I now come to my second point, the issue of the budget, which was also mentioned just now by the rapporteur and by the Commissioner, too. I would say this, and I will keep saying it for as long as necessary: there is no point in the European Union setting ambitious objectives such as promoting cultural diversity and cooperation if the available budget is not up to it, being no more than 15 cents per citizen per year. We have called for a substantial increase in the budget allocated to the programme, so that it can play a part in the rise of a European culture and identity, which will enable us to move beyond national self-interest, and hence to escape from the crisis from which the Union has been suffering for a year and a half now. It has to be said that the 2007-2013 financial perspective, stabilising Community expenditure at 1% of the European Union's GDP, will not allow us to achieve the objectives we have set ourselves in this programme or to give culture the role we intend for it in the building of a stronger Europe with greater solidarity. Therefore, we cannot allow ourselves to punish this programme for a second time by delaying its implementation. As Aristide Briand said, if we cannot have the means for our policy, we must have the policy for our means. We therefore need to act quickly to implement this programme soon, so that we do not disadvantage the cultural organisations on the ground, which rely on this funding and which have been waiting for months for a decision to be taken.

Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, allow me to take my turn in congratulating the rapporteur, Mrs del Castillo Vera, on the work she has just done on this subject that is so important for the future of the Union, and, on behalf of the Committee on Culture and Education, I should like to draw your attention to three points. The first point concerns research. I should like once again to point out that the Union has fallen behind in implementing the Lisbon Strategy in the area of education and training. I did, moreover, stress this point in my report entitled ‘Education as the cornerstone of the Lisbon process’, which was adopted last October. It has to be said that things are moving too slowly in this area, which, as the Commissioner was highlighting, ought to be a priority for the future of the European Union. My second point concerns the role of universities in research and the brain drain. I believe that it is more important than ever to highlight the major role assigned to universities in terms of creating and disseminating knowledge. As such, we strongly recommend that more importance be attached to them by means of developing synergies between the higher education sector, research, lifelong learning and the production sector. There is an urgent need for the European Union to stem the brain drain effectively and to put in place all appropriate measures to attract excellence to EU soil. Finally, the last point that I wanted to highlight concerns job creation. There is also an urgent need for the Member States to make better use of the European funds allocated to them. I wanted to draw your attention here to the Member States that have rightly made job creation a key feature of their projects by investing more than 35% of the ESF funds in modernising their education and training systems.

Mr President, I should like to come back to the attacks suffered in my country, France, by some young German pupils while they took part in an educational exchange programme with some schools in the Paris suburbs. These pupils were greeted with Nazi salutes and were chased by youngsters throwing stones at them. These are extremely serious events, and I should like to express my indignation to you. These are, I am afraid to say, far from isolated incidents. When it is clear that the European idea was constructed, of course, in order to put a stop to xenophobia and to wars between nations, actions such as these are inadmissible. I wanted to take the floor because some people seem to play down actions such as these by claiming that they are normal. That version of ‘normality’ is unacceptable, however, and Europeans unfortunately no longer realise this. It seems to me that it is our duty to react most indignantly. I should like to say to all of you, ladies and gentlemen, and especially to our German friends, that we do not endorse this type of behaviour and that we are even less inclined to allow such practices to be passed over in silence. As a member of the Committee on Culture and Education, I have decided to send a letter to my country’s Minister for National Education calling for him to take appropriate action faced with these disgraceful acts.

Mr President, allow me first of all to congratulate the rapporteur, Mrs Pack, on the work she has done on this subject, so important for the future of the European Union. I should just like to say a few words to point out that the vote within the Committee on Culture and Education has enabled significant progress to be made, in particular with regard to the mobility of apprentices. The specific conditions attaching to the status of apprentices are today preventing these apprentices from fully participating in the Community mobility plan. Only 0.15% of a given age group in France and 1% in Germany today benefit from the Leonardo da Vinci programme. The vote within the Committee on Culture and Education represents significant qualitative progress, as it has made eligible for this programme the support measures taken by all of the organisations involved in promoting the mobility of apprentices. Such progress should enable the objective set by the European Commission – that of securing at least 150 000 work placements by 2013 – to be achieved. We are hopeful that this progress will not be called into question. Mobility of young people – and particularly of apprentices – in vocational training constitutes one of the tools enabling a real spirit of enterprise and innovation to be created in Europe. This is one of the prerequisites for achieving the objectives set by the Heads of State or Government as part of the Lisbon Strategy.

Mr President, allow me first of all to congratulate the rapporteur, Mr Graça Moura, on the work he has done on such a crucial subject as the ‘culture’ programme. I should like quickly to go back over four points, which seem to me to be important and which I defended within the Committee on Culture and Education on behalf of the Socialist Group in the European Parliament. Firstly, as regards the horizontal aspect of the programme, it must be noted that the Commission’s proposal reflects good intentions, which are along the right lines. No one need oppose strengthening the coherence of the programme in order to put a stop to the fragmentation, which for so long has characterised the EU’s action with regard to culture. However, there are the intentions, on the one hand, and the resources proposed, on the other. I therefore come to my second point: the matter of the budget. It is no use the European Union setting ambitious objectives, such as promoting cultural diversity and cultural cooperation, if the budget available is not adjusted. We have therefore called for a logical increase in the budget allocated to this programme so that it can fulfil the task assigned to culture, namely that of contributing to the development of a European culture and a European identity, both of which will enable countries to put a stop to their excessive national self-interest and, consequently, to come out of the crisis that the EU is currently going through. My third point concerns the commemoration sites. We have called for a clear distinction to be made between cultural organisations and the sites, not because we believed that these sites are not important, quite the opposite. As such, we would hope that the Commission will guarantee that the budget for the ‘citizenship’ programme, in which we have asked for the sites to be included, is increased accordingly. Finally – and this will be my final point – I was keen that the cultural industries, which provide so many jobs, should be mentioned in the recitals for this programme. This was particularly the case for Amendments 7, 11 and 13, adopted by the Committee on Culture and Education. A recent study by Eurostat showed that the cultural industry contributed significantly to the European economy. With this in mind, it would be desirable to carry out a study highlighting the importance of these industries for the European economy.

Mr President, I would like firstly to remind you briefly of the context in which I have drawn up this report, then to tell you about the six priorities that have guided me in producing it, and then lastly to draw your attention to six key proposals contained in it. With regard to the context, I must point out that this report is intended to alert the Council to the European Union’s delays in implementing the Lisbon Strategy in the field of education and training. As you know, ladies and gentlemen, the Spring European Council of 22 and 23 March 2005 set the objective of making the European area of education and training a reality. However, the Member States must move on from great declarations to concrete measures. This report therefore defines the priority fields of action. In a very recent working document dedicated to the progress made in the achievement of the Lisbon objectives in the fields of education and training, published on 11 April 2005, the Commission services have analysed the performances of thirty education and training systems. On the basis of the analysis of the very precise data available in this document, I would like to comment on the six priority fields in which I believe the Member States must act urgently, if we want education to keep its place at the heart of the Lisbon process. These six priorities, which I have already listed within the Committee on Culture and Education, are the following: to reduce the high number of young people leaving school early; to tackle the need for a sufficient number of scientists; to implement lifelong education and training strategies that are consistent and that promote social inclusion; to attract more than one million people to the teaching profession over the next decade; to tackle the fact that most pupils in the European Union do not achieve the objective of learning at least two foreign languages; and, finally, to strengthen the open method of coordination and the exchange of good practice in the field of education and training. On the basis of these six priorities, therefore, and of the comments of my colleagues within the Committee on Culture, I would now like to draw your attention to six proposals which appear in this report. First of all, with the aim of developing skills in keeping with the needs of a knowledge-based society, it would appear vital that the Member States quickly take initiatives to, on the one hand, speed up the mobility of students, trainees, workers and their families and researchers and, on the other, to develop social inclusion policies for underprivileged young people afflicted by poverty. Secondly, this report urges the Commission and the Member States to encourage guidance for young people into technical courses of study with potential for jobs and integration. In this regard, I feel that it would be useful for us to propose that the European Union launch an information campaign to promote high-quality technical trades among young people in order thereby to remedy their often negative social image. Thirdly, the report stresses the need for our Parliament to indicate its support for the initiative of a pilot project aimed at creating an Erasmus-type programme for apprentices in order to facilitate access by apprentices to ‘new generation’ Community education and training programmes. Fourthly, within the framework of the budgetary debate, I feel it would be useful also to point to the need for the European Union to guarantee sufficient methods of funding for the new integrated action programme in the field of lifelong education and training. We must also ensure that the European Social Fund continues to be available after 2006 in all the Member States of the European Union. Fifthly, the report calls on the Council to provide for an appropriate budgetary allocation in the next financial perspective for all measures relating to lifelong education and training, on which attainment of the objectives of the Lisbon Strategy will largely depend. Finally, sixthly, this report alerts the Member States to the need to implement, without delay, more consistent national training policies aimed at improving the conditions for access by job-seekers and workers. Finally, ladies and gentlemen, I believe that we are at a crucial time for the European Union. Recent political events have alerted us to the need to place citizens’ education and the fight against unemployment at the heart of all of our public policies. We will not have a competitive economy unless we have an adequate and competitive education and training system. Furthermore, and I say this clearly both to you and to our colleagues in the Commission and the Council, unless an appropriate budget is allocated to education at European level, there will never be any real European citizenship and it will still be just as difficult for the twenty-five countries to agree on a common European project that they can pursue together. I am therefore counting on your support so that we can send a strong message to the Member States that they must urgently put education back at the heart of the Lisbon Strategy.

 Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, thank you for giving me the floor. Allow me first of all to thank the rapporteur and the shadow rapporteurs for the work they have done on a subject as fundamental as the implementation of the European Union’s information and communication strategy. I should like firstly to emphasise the context in which we are led to express an opinion on the EU’s information and communication policy. A number of us have for some months been closely involved in referendum campaigns for the Constitution. The very many public meetings in which I participate never cease to bring it home to me how little knowledge many of our fellow citizens have of the European Union’s basic rules and policies. I therefore wish to support this report and emphasise three crucial points in it. First of all, there is a real need to pay greater attention to the content of the messages in order to arouse people’s interest on the basis of their individual concerns. The recent televised debate between President Chirac and young French people again emphasised the degree to which political leaders were struggling to highlight the positive impact of the European Union on our fellow citizens’ daily concerns. It is obvious, moreover, that only a system of decentralisation can facilitate access to information for a greater number of Europeans. I should like, for example, to testify in this House to the excellent work done by the European Parliament’s Marseille-based information office in my region. Finally, I am convinced that, as emphasised by the report, the information and communication policy will only be effective when knowledge of the European Union and its institutions is integrated as a subject in its own right into the Member States’ school curriculums. (Applause)

Mr President, allow me to take my turn in congratulating the rapporteur on the excellent work he has recently carried out on such a crucial subject as the safeguarding and promotion of European film heritage. I should like, in particular, to point out three crucial points that appear in the report. Firstly, it is clear that the cataloguing, preservation and restoration of works are essential to safeguarding cultural diversity in Europe. Secondly, the report rightly points out the importance of undertaking a systematic collection of cinematographic works thanks to the legal obligation for a system of deposit. Finally, emphasis must be placed on the extent to which the development of new technologies is fundamental to ensuring the cataloguing, preservation and restoration of cinematographic works in order that they be of the highest quality. I should now like to point out the links between this report and the discussions taking place on European programmes in the field of education and Media 2007. This report demands a more active approach on the part of the Member States in the field of visual education, particularly of professional training and media literacy. As the author of the report on the role of education as the cornerstone of the Lisbon process – a report that I will shortly be presenting to the Committee on Culture and Education – I fully support this excellent proposal. Our societies have become more tolerant with the development of literacy. We must henceforth all learn to better read images, which have become the essential vehicle for communication between mankind. In conclusion, I should like to point out that, whilst European cinema is already a fine heritage, it must continue to form part of our future. To this end, I should like to alert my fellow Members to the necessity of integrating financing terms suitable for European film production into the Media 2007 programme. Examples of this exist: the Institute for the financing of film and cultural industries was set up more than 20 years ago in France, precisely to help producers and independent distributors gain access to credit. Access to bank loans is crucial for independent producers, given the way films are financed. I hope that the discussions on the 2007 programme will allow us to find solutions so that the spirit of European cinema is preserved in its entirety.

Mr President, the declarations by the President-in-Office of the Council and the Commissioner are very interesting since they prove the European Parliament right in calling for the signing of a new trade agreement with Turkmenistan to be linked to respect for human rights. The latter is a fundamental principle for trade agreements made by the European Union. However, given the huge number of human rights violations in that country, even now, I believe that the best way to establish this philosophy is to start by postponing this new trade commitment that you are proposing to us, and thus not to give our assent, which we are being asked to give today.

Mr President, it is difficult not to hide one’s disappointment at the end of this summit. If self-satisfaction and fiction were instruments of economic recovery, then we might call it a success. I know that the economy is largely about psychology, and that we must try to restore confidence, but, ultimately, when the crisis worsens to the point where all the Member States are plunging further into recession and unemployment is dramatically rising, hearing the Council declare that it is confident about the EU economy’s medium- and long-term prospects and that it is determined to do everything it takes to revive employment and growth, is all the same rather astounding. Determined to do what? The agenda for this Council has already been expurgated of any proposals that might have related to employment. That was postponed until May. In the end, the May employment summit has itself been transformed during this Council into nothing more than a meeting of the troika. It appears that it was President Sarkozy who succeeded in convincing the other Member States that there was no need to draft proposals making employment a priority of the European Union’s operations. This calls to mind an opt-out that had already been requested previously by other governments, by a UK conservative government, in relation to the entire employment strand of the European treaties. So, today, Mr Sarkozy is calling for an opt-out from employment policies. What would be worrying is if this approach were to rub off on all the Member States. I am not overly surprised that your Commission, Mr Barroso, which has in some ways sidelined the European social agenda during its term of office, which has created an opt-out in relation to the European Union’s social and employment priorities and which has yielded by obeying that order given just now by a member of your majority, the conservative European People’s Party (Christian Democrats) and European Democrats, but I do believe that it is truly disgraceful and that, when it comes to coordinating not only recovery policies but also employment policies, it is the workers who are ultimately going to pay the price for this non-Europe. A work of fiction, too, are these EUR 400 billion that you are adding up, as they are the sum not only of national recovery plans but above all of policies that are not even national recovery policies since they are just infamous economic stabilisers, that is, the increase in social expenditure linked to the increase in unemployment. You have put a further EUR 5 billion on the table, but it has pained you to do so. I therefore believe that, on the contrary, we now need a real recovery plan like the one being introduced by the United States, which has put more than USD 780 million on the table, and coordination of the efforts made to support workers coping with the crisis. We also need demand, which is another factor that will prove far more effective than self-satisfaction when it comes to reviving growth, and to restoring confidence and the dynamism of our economy.

Madam President, too little, too late, inadequately coordinated, lacking in solidarity, undersized: these are the real reactions provoked by the European Union recovery plan and the Commission proposals at this stage. The reason is really simple: looking at the initial forecasts, we are all obliged to acknowledge that the depth of the crisis was under-estimated, be it in terms of the truly spectacular fall in industrial production in the United Kingdom and France, for example, the fall in international trade and German exports, or the forecasts of increased unemployment. I therefore truly believe that, today, we are very far from a response that matches what is being implemented, for example, by the Obama administration in the United States. There is, once again, a perceived lack of solidarity and a high degree of timidity. In March, we saw Ecofin refuse to increase the recovery plans, and we are seeing the countries of Eastern Europe be reduced to calling on the IMF. This is a lamentable failure where European solidarity is concerned; we are allowing more and more national rescue plans for the industrial sector and we are reduced merely to calling for a rejection of protectionism. The fact is, the only true response would be a European rescue and recovery plan for the automotive sector. I believe that, today, the Socialist Group in the European Parliament’s demand is extremely clear: we want massive investment. As we often refer to the crisis of 1929, let us look by way of comparison at the example of Roosevelt’s New Deal, which spent 3.5% of GDP over seven years. For Europe, today, that would be the equivalent of EUR 400 billion per year over several years. We therefore believe that borrowing facilities and Eurobonds should be made available, that there should be huge investment in green innovation, in the insulation of buildings, in modern transport and in the energy sector, and that there should be a support plan for the victims of restructuring and unemployment, and an indication of how all those faced with unemployment can be helped, by means, for example, of extending the scope of the European Globalisation Adjustment Fund.

 Against the current backdrop of crisis and social insecurity for workers, today the Council puts to the vote in Parliament a common position that poses a genuine threat to the foundations of the European social model, by weakening working time standards. Implementing a clause to derogate from the weekly limit of 48 hours and not calculating on-call time as working time risks creating a two-speed social Europe, divided between workers who can benefit from social protection in their Member States and others who cannot refuse to accept diminished social rights. Contrary to the discussion of the Commission and certain States of the Council of the European Union, which presents the free choice to opt-out as progress, I chose to support the amendments of the rapporteur, Mr Cercas, which are the expression of Parliament’s position at first reading in 2004. These amendments require that the opt-out clause be repealed 36 months after the directive enters into force, that on-call time be calculated as working time (recognised by the CJEC), as well as guarantees with regard to compensatory rest time and the reconciling of family and professional life.

Mr President, I should like to respond to the speeches made by Mr Corbett and others concerning our return to Strasbourg and the running costs involved. It is true that Europe is not just about what is reasonable. Although it tries to be rational, it operates on the basis of symbols, too. It is not a unitary state, and we do not operate with only one capital in which all our institutions are based. Some are here in Strasbourg; the Central Bank is in Frankfurt; I believe that the Medicines Agency is in the United Kingdom. All this comes at a price. However, we also know the price to be paid for not having a Europe; we have paid it enough throughout our history. Thus EUR 200 million – if that is one of the elements that enable institutions to function properly, and, for example, enable Europe to get a better grasp of the problems of the financial markets and, perhaps, in the future, to save over EUR 1 000 billion on rescue plans for financial institutions – then I believe that that is a price worth paying to have a properly functioning democracy.

Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen – I hope that the Council Presidency is going to join us – it has now been more than six years since the adoption of the Directive on temporary work was postponed, not because of Parliament, which gave its opinion as soon as the Commission's proposal was referred to it in 2002, but precisely because of the deadlock of certain Member States within the Council. We have the opportunity today, after the adoption of a common position between the Member States, to arrive at this important piece of social legislation at a time when expectations of a social Europe are high, and it is this opportunity that we must seize. Temporary work accounts for more than three million jobs in the Union. Temporary workers are employed by around 20 000 companies, which represent a turnover of EUR 75 billion. This is a sector that is obviously very liable to fluctuations in growth, and temporary workers are today the first to be affected by the economic slowdown and the rise in unemployment. However, like other types of insecure and atypical employment, temporary work has seen structural growth over the last few years, and this development was estimated at almost 60% over the last five years. It is a development that has continued with particular intensity within the new Member States. Temporary work concerns a very large number of sectors that vary according to the Member State: industry, in some countries, services, in others, and construction, agriculture and transport, in others still. Its proportion also varies a great deal from one country to another. It may be as much as 5% of all workers in countries such as the United Kingdom. The duration of assignments also varies. In some countries it is short, with assignments lasting around 10 days, in France, for example; less than a week, in Spain; or around 20 days in Finland. However, in other countries, such as Ireland, Belgium and the Netherlands, it may be several months, indeed even a year or more in Austria. Temporary workers, as we know, are more exposed to physical risks, intensity of work and accidents at work. Their training is often less extensive. Stress linked to the insecurity of their jobs is also extremely common. The fact is, the laws and the types of legal framework relating to their situation differ greatly within the Member States – so much so that temporary workers are, for example, truly protected by equal treatment, in particular in terms of pay, in just 10 of the 27 countries of the European Union. Their access to training, social protection, maternity leave – these subjects all vary and are absolutely not guaranteed in the same way in all the Member States. That is why the European Commission, at the request of the social partners, and with the support of the European Parliament, wanted a piece of legislation that could guarantee such equal treatment. Having received an initial draft, in November 2002 the European Parliament, following on from the report by my fellow Member, Mrs van den Burg, who is still here in this House and to whom I should like to pay tribute, strengthened this draft legislation by making it possible to guarantee equal treatment from day one, in particular regarding pay. When its common position was adopted last June, the Council eventually came round to the European Parliament's position. It therefore believed that equal treatment from day one should be the general rule and that any derogation from this principle needed to be agreed on by the social partners by means of collective negotiations or through agreements concluded with the social partners at national level. The European Parliament's amendments on the definition of the basic working and employment conditions, in particular with the inclusion of pay in Article 3, have also been incorporated in the common position. Lastly, the Council's common position has retained the amendments on access to employment, collective facilities and vocational training, and on the right of temporary workers to be represented under the same conditions as those of permanent workers employed by the user enterprise. A debate has taken place within the Committee on Employment and Social Affairs concerning Parliament's initial proposal to amend the Commission's proposal to add elements relating to health, safety and hygiene at work, which have not been adopted by the Council. However, these guarantees exist under the terms of another directive, the Council Directive of 25 June 1991, which supplements the measures to encourage improvements in the health and safety at work of workers with a fixed-duration employment relationship or a temporary employment relationship. As you know, ladies and gentlemen – I am going to end this first speech on this point – the European Trade Union Confederation, on the one hand, and the professional bodies representing temporary employment agencies, on the other, want us to adopt this legislation. Adopting this legislation today means ensuring that the European Parliament's positions at first reading henceforth become the law; that this framework for protecting temporary workers can be transposed within the next three years; and that the Pandora's box of uncertain negotiations within the Council cannot be reopened. That is why the Committee on Employment and Social Affairs decided on 7 October to recommend the adoption of the common position, without amendment, in order to protect this, the most insecure employment sector in Europe.

 Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, I should like to start by thanking my fellow Members for their comments, and the shadow rapporteurs, the coordinators and everyone else involved in this debate for the support they have given to me, and equally to the finalisation of this process. It is true that this report boils down to an explanatory statement and a single request: 'let us say yes'. The imminent adoption, I hope, in two days' time of this directive is a victory for the European Parliament, and a victory for the social partners, and I should like to take this opportunity to respond to the members of the Confederal Group of the European United Left/Nordic Green Left, who tabled a number of amendments. I understand where these amendments are coming from, in essence, but I should nevertheless like to emphasise the fact that the European Trade Union Confederation once again spoke to the chairmen of the political groups, a few days ago, to say that the adoption of this directive, in unamended form, would send a strong signal that social progress at EU level was both necessary and possible, and that social Europe was still alive. At a time when the temporary work sector is growing, as are other atypical forms of employment contract, we need to have a legal framework, and that is the decision that we are now taking. Europe is an area of justice: it needs to be so in the interests of civil rights, and also in economic and social terms. We have already enshrined in various directives the protections and rights enjoyed by all workers. Now that more and more people are temporary workers, we need to ensure that they have the same rights, and that temporary work cannot be abused as a way to evade either the rights of workers concerned or those of other workers who would consequently suffer from pressures and social dumping. We also want to show, in adopting this directive, that social Europe can move forwards, and that it can have real substance, contrary to what we have sometimes heard from the Commission – not from Mr Špidla, but from other Commissioners. We can legislate – we can colegislate – on social matters, too, and thus show the members of the Council, who have, for too long, blocked the adoption of this and other legislation, that they need not be afraid of the progress of social Europe, and that, if we can show that Europe is defending citizens and workers, this may also help to bring about a reconciliation between the citizens and the institutions of the Union and to assuage the concerns expressed in Ireland, the Netherlands and my own country, France. I believe that further progress with regard to social directives will also help to foster further progress with regard to political Europe, and with regard to people's support for the progress of political Europe.

 Madam President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, what is at stake now within the framework of these WTO negotiations? I do not think that it should be the lot, as noble as these people are, of Mr Mandelson or Baroness Ashton. I am not even sure that the most important thing is the issue of industrial tariffs, agricultural tariffs and market access. Clearly, we all want the agreement to be solid, to be fair for Europe, but I think that there are two main issues here. The first is the preservation of a multilateral framework for trade. We can see how much the absence of this framework in another area of globalisation – the financial markets – costs in terms of the risk to the economy, to citizens and to our society. This is what is at stake, because if these six years of negotiations result in failure, we know what sort of bilateral agreements will gradually replace them within the WTO. This is a flawed framework. We want to reform the WTO – we said so in our draft resolution – we also want to have other trade-related dimensions to be taken into account, particularly environmental dimensions, to deal with the impact on climate change and social rules. This is absolutely fundamental. However, it is not by dissolving the multilateral framework, but by strengthening it, that we will succeed in better organising this aspect of globalisation. The second issue – which I will not go into because it was covered by my colleague Mr Arif – is the rebalancing of rules that were set during the Uruguay Round, during the creation of the WTO, to reflect differences in terms of development, the situation of the least developed countries, the situation of developing countries. You also mentioned this, Commissioner, with the request for an ‘
everything but arms’ style initiative, with a safeguard clause for sensitive products. In this regard, we need to introduce rules – not necessarily free-trade rules – that look at each situation. We want fair trade, provided that it is not just about the law of the jungle. These, I believe, are the two main issues on which European negotiators must focus. It is only natural that they should be concentrating on other measures, such as agriculture, services – although not by questioning the right of developing countries to regulate public services – and industrial tariffs, but not at the expense of a successful outcome to this development round.

Mr President, Commissioner, President-in-Office of the Council, ladies and gentlemen, this new social agenda comes late in the day and it is a feeble response to the precarious situation, inequalities and effects of recession currently plaguing the workforce and many of our fellow citizens in Europe. With more than 70 million people in poverty, even where unemployment levels are falling, with precarious living and working conditions and the growth of atypical forms of employment, we really do need a solid social base, a Europe that protects us. This is one of the focuses of the French EU Presidency. And as you said, Minister, 2008 was supposed to be a come-back year, the year in which social Europe was re-energised. Regrettably, your Government did not make the social dimension one of the four priorities for its Presidency. As we approach the end of the European Commission's term we have proposals, some of which, it must be said, do at last reflect things which the European Parliament and our Group in particular has called for: a genuine directive against discrimination in all areas, not just disability; at long last the raising of moves to strengthen and revise the directive on European works councils, and measures to ensure that our existing principles and laws on equal pay for men and women are properly upheld in the Member States. But just look at the shortcomings, the gaps in this new social agenda! I will name two of them in particular. One is the response to recent judgments by the European Court of Justice in the Laval, Rüffert and Viking cases, which weaken our resistance to social dumping in the European Union. We think that the assurance given in the Commission's communication, that the Commission will provide legal clarity and interpretative guidelines on this directive, is not enough. Due note must be taken of the fact – and we have held Parliamentary hearings organised by the Employment and Social Affairs Committee – that the directive is inherently defective and that Union law must, by revising the directive on the posting of workers, make it clear that the Union's economic freedoms, freedom of establishment, cannot stand in the way of fundamental workers' rights, the right to collective bargaining, rights on pay, the right to strike in defence of their interests, if need be. So we want the revision of this directive to be placed on the agenda and we want a social safeguard clause guaranteeing that in future no directive, no Union policy, no treaty principle can be applied to the detriment of workers' rights; so that where one country has a higher standard of workers' rights than another, that higher standard can never again be lowered by invocation of the country of origin principle, as we saw with the first version of the services directive – the Bolkestein directive. Secondly, Mr Bertrand tells us that social services of general interest, operations in the general interest, should be encouraged for the wellbeing of our social model. But we have had no proposal for a directive on services of general economic
 interest. We cannot properly protect social services of general interest and implement Article 14 of the Lisbon Treaty, which provides the legal base for such services to be commissioned and funded, unless the Council puts a request to the Commission and unless the Commission uses its right of initiative so that we can at last talk about a legal framework that will protect public service operations, guarantee the independence of local authorities in the local services they provide and give us the assurance that future Court of Justice rulings will not threaten this fundamental feature of the European social model, so that people feel, not as Mr Schulz said, that Europe works against their social model but on the contrary that the Commission and the other European institutions work to safeguard it.

 Mr President, President-in-Office of the Council, you wanted to place your Presidency under the aegis of the Europe that protects, and I think that there is indeed a very high expectation among European citizens. However, this is why there is a contradiction here – and you understood the key message from the Socialist Group in the European Parliament – with the fact that the social dimension of European integration has not been given the status of one of the four main priorities of your Presidency. Indeed, as we have seen in recent referendums, people are questioned regarding the institutions and the treaties, but in fact they respond on the basis of the progress of European integration, and finally on Europe’s policies. I think that the imbalance that has been created in recent years between the progress of economic integration – which has been pursued and this is a good thing – and the stagnation of the social dimension, is also behind this disenchantment among the people of the Union, this disaffection towards the European institutions. This is why the problem is not saying that Europe should get involved with all social matters, but rather that as soon as there is a single market, including a single employment market, there need to be common rules for combating disparities, which otherwise lead to social dumping, and to ensure that convergence elements are focused upwards, towards the best, rather than dragging social situations downwards. The Commission has just published a social agenda, but if the Council does not commit to some concrete issues – you talked about a concrete Europe – to strengthen the powers of the European works committees, to protect temporary workers, to improve the Directive on the posting of workers so that – and this needs to be added – there is a Directive on the protection of public services and social services in the general interest, then there will not be a response to this need for protection. One of your priorities is the Europe of immigration, but the Europe of immigration cannot be reduced to a Europe of expulsions. This is why we need to add to this a pact for integration, which we talked about with Mr Hortefeux – and a pact for development. You have just come from the G8; Europe and some of the Member States, including France, were accused of not fulfilling their commitments in terms of public aid for development. Ensure that during your Presidency this commitment of moving towards 0.7% of GDP is fulfilled, which will be more effective than the disgraceful ‘return directive’ in contributing towards managing international immigration more effectively.

 Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, the directive on European Works Councils was pioneering at the time of its adoption in 1994. Although it only set minimum requirements, it opened the way for employees of Community-scale groups to have the right to be informed and consulted, and was one of the founding elements of European labour law. But today, it lags behind changes in corporate reality, and behind the financial focus of the governance of companies, and it even lags behind other directives on informing and consulting employees that have been adopted since. It is therefore absolutely necessary to revise it, to ensure that in Community-scale groups, receiving information in good time and ensuring a high standard of consultation mean that alternatives can be found where employees are facing decisions about restructuring, site closures and massive job cuts. Too often over the last few years we have witnessed sudden decisions to make collective redundancies without the possibility of employees really being consulted or their representatives really being able to have their say. Sometimes employees hear on the radio that they are going to be made redundant. Their representatives are only informed a few minutes before the decision is made public, generally at the time the stock exchanges open. All of this underlines the urgent need for a revision. Furthermore, this revision was provided for in the text of the original directive, and in 2000 the mechanisms of this directive should have been updated. Since then, BusinessEurope – or UNICE as it was at the time – has done everything it can to block this revision, to ensure that the consultation ended in nothing. That is why, ladies and gentlemen, Mr Bushill-Matthews, as rapporteur for the European Parliament with others in 2001, and having helped to get the request for an ambitious revision of this directive adopted by a large majority in Parliament, as was the case again in 2007, I cannot accept this criticism of the European Trade Union Confederation. It is sincere and it is prepared to negotiate. If this consultation, this negotiation results in nothing, it is up to the Commission to use its right of initiative. The Commission has a monopoly on the right of initiative. We respect that. However, that also gives it a responsibility, that of defending the general interest of Europe, of not allowing it to be held hostage by private interests, of ensuring that employees on our continent can count on the European Commission to defend their right to consultation and information, in good time, so that a genuine European social dialogue can exist in the major Community-scale groups.

Madam President, I am surprised at this late request by the ALDE Group, which is not in line with the agreement reached between the groups in the Committee on International Trade when it voted on the report. We shall therefore be opposing the request. We think that, in fact, the proposal in that paragraph to give the poorest small developing countries the chance to receive the proceeds of fines imposed on large developing countries by the WTO is a request that the European Parliament should support.

 Madam President, Commissioner, it is essential to complete the Doha Round but it is also essential to examine once again the functioning of the WTO. Every day we can see that it is beset by problems concerning its efficiency, legitimacy and interaction with the other bodies of the multilateral system. To some extent it was inevitable that, just over 10 years after its creation, its operating mechanisms would need to be reviewed. By changing from the GATT to the WTO, the multilateral trading system did not just change in dimension; in some regards it changed in nature, too. The trade rules were extended to a considerable range of new areas: services, intellectual property, investment, non-tariff barriers. New member countries joined the original ones and this enlargement introduced a diversity, a disparity of situations and Member States, with different resources and different problems. All of that obviously means that, in addition to the efforts to complete the negotiations on the Development Round, the necessary reforms have to be examined. I welcome the work carried out by our rapporteur, Mrs Muscardini, and the fact that we were able to cooperate with her and with the other groups. I would like to emphasise several points in this extremely important report, which, I hope, will be adopted by a large majority of this House tomorrow. The first element is the balance in terms of international standards and the establishment of new relations between the WTO and the other international organisations. You will see in the report that we obviously mention the interaction with environmental issues, health issues – and this is clearly vital, as seen in the case of generic medicines and intellectual property – but also with social issues. We cannot fail to discuss this topic in the WTO. Cooperation between the ILO and the WTO, which was resumed by the Directors-General of the two organisations, must go much further and the European Union must act as the driving force in this respect. We are putting forward two specific proposals: the first is that the ILO should be granted observer status in the WTO, as is the case for the International Monetary Fund; the second is that the WTO should set up – and the Union should propose this – a committee on trade and decent employment, modelled on the Committee on Trade and Environment, which has enabled a great deal of progress to be made on the interaction between environmental and trade rules. Secondly, I would like to emphasise the aspects of the report that encourage the WTO to give more resources to the weakest members, to the least developed countries, to ensure equal, effective and efficient participation in all the negotiations and in all the committees in which future agreements and trade policies are shaped. Thirdly, we also stress the importance of external transparency and the possibility of civil society, parliamentarians and a truly dynamic parliamentary dimension playing a greater role in the WTO. We want to see a genuine parliamentary assembly. At present, a Parliamentary Conference meets alongside the WTO. The Director-General has recently addressed it and the trade ministers, too, but we want it to be recognised, which is why we are putting forward very specific proposals, for instance in relation to the appeal body and on dispute settlement. Since these proceedings are similar to those in a court or tribunal, they should take place in public and the documents should be publicly available. I also believe that that would help to dispel certain myths and make the organisation more transparent. Finally, the secretariat’s resources represent another important issue, which has been highlighted. The WTO’s budget today is USD 135 million: six times less than that of the IMF and almost 10 times less than that of the World Bank. It employs around 600 staff, a figure that is again much lower than that of the other multilateral organisations. As a result, increasing the resources of a WTO that is better incorporated in the system of multilateral organisations is, in my opinion, one of the conditions for better trade rules that promote development.

 Mr President, Mr President of the Commission, ladies and gentlemen, on the eve of the spring summit, the economy is in turmoil, markets are deregulated, stock markets are crashing, growth is falling. That is international capitalism for you, creating wealth or destroying value at the whim of the markets, speculative bubbles, financial derivatives and crazed traders who, by the way, are merely doing what they are asked to do, i.e. obtain the maximum profit in the minimum time. However, though the markets are that way, no human society can live like that. At any rate, it is this phenomenon that may give Europe its very meaning in this globalised market: a Europe that obviously cannot completely escape this turmoil, a Europe that is itself one of the main players in globalisation, often to its benefit, but that largely finds in globalisation its meaning and vocation to counterbalance crazed capitalism through public regulation, economic stabilisation, active public policies to support growth in the real economy, support for public and private investment in research, innovation, and European infrastructure. The monetary policy, for instance, ought to protect stability, which it does, but it also ought to stimulate growth and adjust parity in the best possible fashion to defend our exports, although as things stand today this is unfortunately not yet the case. Finally and above all, our group stresses that the EU must counterbalance this destabilised high-finance economy with effective social protection, solid public services and guaranteed social rights for workers. Mr President, Europe must now take much more action to anticipate and protect: it cannot merely act as an internal market within the vast overall market. It must be more socially aware. That is also the way to recover the support and trust of its citizens. We now support the Lisbon Strategy, a strategy fundamentally based on these three pillars, which you have already mentioned here, but your words must be matched by action, by real EU policies; otherwise your social intentions will remain a dead letter. That is why we have called for a revision of the guidelines since they can be used to pilot the project. We specifically ask you, however, for it is the substance that is important here, to relaunch the European social agenda. There must be, for instance, a Commission reaction to the Laval case. It must use its powers of initiative to propose a revision of the Posting of Workers Directive. There must be a truly ambitious revision of the European Works Councils Directive to allow social dialogue in major groups facing restructuring to be utilised effectively and in a timely fashion. There must be a revision, a real adaptation of the Working Time Directive to combat opt-outs and abuse of excessive working hours. The Temporary Work Directive must be adopted in order to combat casual employment. You must launch an ambitious lifelong learning programme so that this fifth pillar, this fifth fundamental freedom, is not just reserved only for an elite, but enables all people to fulfil effectively their own potential as workers to enable them to adapt to changes in the economy and the job market. Mr President of the Commission, this is our message: use your power of initiative to help the Council to adopt an ambitious programme for a social Europe.

Mr President, Commissioner, we cannot help noticing that the way in which negotiations were conducted by the Commission has failed to secure signature of genuine EPAs before the scheduled date. Here I agree with Mr Sturdy: the interim agreements call into question the regional groups that had been created and formed the basis of discussions to sign these EPAs. Far from strengthening links and trust between Europe and ACP states, negotiations have aroused great concern. There is concern in relation to losses of public resources: the Senegalese President recently told the press that between 35% and 70% of African budgets were made up of customs tariffs: Nigeria is set to lose 800 million euros, for instance. There is concern in relation to the consequences of liberalisation for fragile sectors of ACP economies, which will have to face competition from European businesses. There is concern in relation to the requests to include a number of subjects in the second phase, which do not correspond to WTO obligations. Here I am thinking of services, investment, public markets and the rules of competition. There is concern in relation to the threat of introducing higher customs tariffs in 2008 for non-LDC ACP states as a kind of blackmail forcing them to accept any agreement. I feel we need to give ACP-EU relations a new lease of life and get negotiations back on the tracks of the main Cotonou principles. EPAs are development instruments. Liberalisation is not an end in itself. The aim of EPAs is to strengthen ACP economies to help them move into the world economy. No ACP state should be worse off after an EPA than before it was signed. The signatories must benefit from a preference system at least as favourable as before any EPA signature. Agreements must be based on the interests of the ACP states and their economic diversification. The rules of origin must be clarified to ascertain the extent to which they will benefit from any new market access measures we put forward, and genuine mechanisms for financial compensation must be implemented. The message in the Kigali Declaration by members of parliament in ACP states and in Europe must be understood. The date of 31 December is not as fatal a blow as the one you dealt.

Mr President, President of the Commission, I believe that the people of Europe have very high expectations when it comes to the social dimension of European integration and that the strengthening of this social pillar is the weak link, if not to say the missing link, in the Commission’s strategy. We need to stop opposing the strategy for growth, the establishment of the single market and the strengthening of the social pillar. This is a key factor for the support of the peoples of Europe and it is also, quite simply, an essential condition for the success of the Lisbon Strategy and for strengthening the competitiveness and economic efficiency of the European Union. In this respect there is a striking contrast with the awareness of the challenges posed by climate change, which effectively seemed to stem from last year’s spring summit, and indeed the priorities laid down in the Commission’s work programme contain more than a trace of this. We are a long way from displaying the same enthusiasm when it comes to meeting the challenges posed by social inclusion and the need to create a Europe that works for everyone, a Europe capable of promoting not just more jobs but better jobs too. There are declarations of intent and there are various references here and there, in the introduction and in the preamble, but these scarcely figure in the action programme, nor are they included in the legislative initiatives. Take, for example, lifelong learning, which is mentioned and which, as an accessory to the success of the new policy for the reform of the labour market, is essential if we want to have a fair and efficient system of ‘flexicurity’. However, there is no grand ambitious programme, something the equivalent, for example, of the old Erasmus scheme, which is not only bearing fruit but has also proved a very effective link via which EU citizens can recognise and acknowledge the work of the European Union. When it comes to combating social exclusion and poverty, and promoting social protection, the proposals for action are essentially limited to non-legislative initiatives. We also regret the absence of any progress on the Working Time Directive and Part-Time Work Directive. Similarly, in the area of taxation, we cannot but note that for want of an initiative on a genuine corporate tax base – which is something that Parliament has been advocating and which the Commissioner concerned was working on – we are still not moving towards a more equitable single market in this particular respect. Finally, we are impatiently waiting for two initiatives that you announced. The first concerns the review of the European Works Council Directive, which Parliament has been calling for since 2001, and the second, which you mentioned, concerns maternity leave. I would like to conclude by referring to two examples of deadlock that seem to us to be absolutely incomprehensible and unacceptable: they relate firstly to services of general economic interest and secondly to social services of general interest. After so many White Papers, Green Papers, announcements, disputes before the Court of Justice and a number of clear and repeated demands from the Committee of the Regions and the Economic and Social Committee, and even though a consensus was reached between the Member States in the Council on including a new article in the Lisbon Treaty to provide a clear basis for a legislative initiative – in codecision with Parliament – on public services, which are services of general interest, there is still no concrete proposal forthcoming. Public services lie at the heart of our social model. The people of Europe are waiting for clarification that competition rules and single market rules will not suddenly just be imposed on them. Mr President, you should present an initiative to Parliament on this issue.

Mr President, Europe is about more than just its treaties; its difficulties are not solely – and not even principally – of an institutional nature, and the revival of Europe will have to hinge on policies, European projects and the EU budget. However, it is a fact that the deadlock on the reform of the institutions, the failure to ratify the Constitution in several countries and the non-ratification procedures in others have bogged Europe down, plunged it into crisis and tested its unity. In fact, the compromise reached to convene the Intergovernmental Conference and the mandate in view of the future modifying treaty do not arouse enthusiasm. Everything is complicated in this agreement, which contains many footnotes, so much so that the future treaty will not be simplified at all and will be difficult for Europeans to understand. The opt-out that has been granted concerning the Charter of Fundamental Rights is truly appalling on the part of those who requested it. At least this Charter will apply to the 26 other EU countries, and that does them great credit. However, at least this agreement is an agreement, and came at a time when Europe needed to affirm its unity. I believe that we have to give every opportunity to the Intergovernmental Conference and, above all – and, on this particular point, I would like to react to the remarks made by my fellow Member, Mr Wurtz – the mandate for convening the Intergovernmental Conference has at least one virtue: that of basing its work on the institutional innovations that were, for the most part, contained in the first part of the draft European Constitution. That is a key point since the first part of the Constitution was scarcely challenged, even by the 'No' camp, those who claim to adhere to European integration in any case, in the countries in which referendums were held. The future treaty should therefore take up the elements on which there is a consensus among all sincere Europeans, whether they voted ‘Yes’ or ‘No' to the Constitution: there should be enhanced powers for the European Parliament and the national parliaments, a stable Council Presidency, double majority voting, fewer blocking minorities, fewer unanimous decisions taken, not least regarding judicial and police cooperation, an enhanced common foreign and security policy, enhanced and structured cooperation in the area of defence policy, which will be easier to implement, and new powers in the areas of energy and climate change. Furthermore, there are also two points that were in the third part but that, I believe, all the progressives will want to protect: the horizontal social clause and an article making it possible to protect services of general economic interest and, therefore, to adopt a directive in favour of public services. I hope that, if the Intergovernmental Conference takes up all these points, all the advocates of Europe, whether they voted ‘Yes’ or 'No' to the draft Constitution, will support the future draft treaty. (Applause)

Mr President, it is true that it is difficult to resist the temptation to congratulate the Chancellor, and, I may add, I am not resisting it. Mrs Merkel, I congratulate you, even though I will remain more doubtful of the future treaty itself. At the end of the day, however, the reform of the treaties was at a standstill, Europe was stuck in a rut, its unity had been tested, and you gave it another chance. The agreement passed on 23 June in Brussels is a complicated compromise, one that was reached after much effort in a Council that is marked more by the national tensions of some than by the universal sharing of the European spirit; a compromise reached at the expense of the ridiculous relinquishment of the EU symbols and of the appalling opt-out on the Charter of Fundamental Rights. However, this is at least an agreement that has come at a time when Europe needs to affirm its unity and its desire to move forward so as to meet the citizens' expectations and to rise to the challenges it faces in the world and within Europe. Every opportunity must therefore be given to the forthcoming Intergovernmental Conference. As for the treaty itself, we will be able to give a definitive judgment on it only after we have seen the final text that will be derived from it. Doubts remain, but the mandate does at least have the virtue of taking up the institutional innovations that were contained in the first part of the draft constitution and that have scarcely been challenged, even in countries in which the 'No' vote prevailed in the referendum. I am referring to the enhanced powers of the European Parliament, to the Common Foreign and Security Policy, to the new majority decision-making rules and to the shift to unanimity on a number of issues and, therefore, from this point of view, I hope that the outcome will make it possible for the progress contained in the draft Constitution to be confirmed. Having said that, there are two points that I should like to highlight as being important to our group and that concern the European Union’s social dimension. On the one hand, there was an article on the horizontal social clause and, on the other, an article providing a legal basis for the adoption of a directive on services of general economic interest. On these two points, the mandate of the Intergovernmental Conference remains vague. We will be very vigilant when it comes to ensuring that, after having renounced the Charter of Fundamental Rights, the Member States gathered within the IGC do not further undermine these two possible advances in the social dimension of the European treaties.

Madam President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, I should like to begin by thanking our rapporteur, Mrs Panayatopoulos-Cassiotou, for the spirit of cooperation that she has shown and for the quality of her work. Since the 2005 United Nations Summit, the promotion of decent work has been recognised as an objective of the entire international community. With its communication, the European Commission has begun to consider the issues at stake in this matter, not least its international dimension: I am referring to the EU’s external policies, concerning in particular international trade, hence the work of the Committee on International Trade. I should therefore like to focus on this aspect and express my satisfaction that, through this report, Parliament is taking up several practical proposals that were submitted by my group. These proposals had already been adopted in the opinion of the Committee on International Trade and will make it possible to initiate a new EU policy aimed at promoting social standards at international level. Firstly, the Union already makes the signing of preferential trade agreements with developing countries conditional on the ratification of the International Labour Organisation conventions. We are now calling for the sanctioning, the suspension of the preferences granted to countries that seriously and systematically violate fundamental labour standards and, more specifically, freedom of association. Secondly, all future bilateral trade agreements and, in particular, the new free trade agreements, which are due to be negotiated within the context of the global Europe strategy, must include social clauses on respect for decent work. Thirdly, the multilateral dimension must not be abandoned, because it is the multilateral framework – that of the WTO – which today governs the bulk of trade. However, the Commission communication does not mention it whatsoever. The debate therefore needs to be re-opened within the WTO. Europe could take a number of initiatives in this regard. Firstly, it could propose the creation of a ‘Trade and decent work’ committee within the WTO, on the model of the ‘Trade and environment’ committee, which has enabled some important progress to be made. Secondly, it could call for the ILO to be granted observer status within the WTO. Thirdly, it could call for the pre-eminence of the decisions taken by the International Labour Organisation to be recognised when the latter decides to call for trade sanctions against countries such as Burma, for example, which is seemingly violating trade union rights. We have made a number of other practical proposals. I believe that it is in our interest to promote a form of regulated globalisation that ... (The President cut off the speaker)

Madam President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, I should like to confine myself to making four remarks. Firstly, Commissioner, I believe that you were right to stress the fact that the strategy of a global Europe must not mean ceasing to give priority to multilateral negotiations. There is a great deal of enthusiasm, but also a great many illusions, regarding the contribution that bilateral free trade agreements can make. We are told that we must have such agreements because others have made a commitment along these lines, including, for example, the United States. In fact, the United States has signed only six or seven free trade agreements, which represent scarcely 5% of its external trade. The other agreements have failed, because they pose the same problems as in the multilateral framework, with, generally speaking, the same kind of partners. I should like to add that these negotiations often result in agreements that are more unbalanced towards developing countries, to the obvious advantage of developed countries. This leads me to my second remark: in moving from the multilateral context to the bilateral context, we must not abandon the trade policy development objectives along the way. From this point of view, Mr Caspary, I do not believe that it can be said that trade policy is unrelated to other dimensions: development, the fight against poverty, the environment and social policy. The fact is, the relationship between trade and development and trade and poverty reduction is not automatic. For example, it is said that, if Africa does not trade, it will remain poor. That is true. But does it mean that any trade agreement with Africa will necessarily benefit it? No, that is not true. We need to take account of a more differentiated, controlled, form of liberalisation, which caters for the fragile sectors of a number of countries. This is not the case solely for the poorest countries; it is also the case for emerging countries, countries such as India, which are among those with the poorest populations in the world. Thirdly, this global Europe strategy should not result in the re-introduction of subjects that have been excluded from the multilateral framework. I am thinking of the Singapore issues and of the negotiations on investment, public contracts and public services. The re-introduction of these subjects is not justifiable; it will result in the same problems, in the same standstills, or else these subjects will be forcibly imposed, when they go beyond the trade rules and concern the internal regulation of sensitive sectors, such as access to essential services, to public services. Fourthly – and I shall conclude on this point – like Mr Jonckheer, I believe that we should not lose sight of the fact that the Union, through its trade policy too, is working to implement social rules and environmental rules. These rules are being implemented by means of the enhanced system of generalised preferences and no longer in the free trade agreements, and I regret this because we should also promote compliance, for instance, with the ILO rules.

Mr President, I should like to begin by thanking our rapporteur, Mrs Vergnaud, who unfortunately had her work cut out with the Committee on the Internal Market and Consumer Protection because, as Commissioner Kyprianou pointed out to us, we have, on the one hand, case-law, that is to say, in fact, the Treaties as interpreted by the Court of Justice, and, on the other hand, the position adopted by the European Parliament during the vote on the Services Directive, a position that clearly stated that a choice needed to be made between what falls under the internal market and what, for the sake of defending the social values of the Union, must fall under other mechanisms. I believe, in fact, that the Committee on the Internal Market and Consumer Protection – not just Mr Manders, unfortunately, since, in order to have a majority, the members of the Group of the European People’s Party (Christian Democrats) and European Democrats and of the Group of the Alliance of Liberals and Democrats for Europe had to support it – has done something very regrettable in seeking to re-introduce health services into the framework of the directive on services in the internal market: in none of our countries, in fact, are commercial services and construction, on the one hand, and hospital services and patient services, on the other, included in the same legislation. There are, in fact, different rationales. It is true, firstly, that we need to act in accordance with subsidiarity, with the mechanisms for funding our social systems and with the authorisation mechanisms of health care institutions, but we must also take account of the European area and of movement in that area, and thus promote access for all to health services. This must, however, fall within the realm of specific mechanisms. That is why, just as we need them for social services of general interest and, moreover, just as we need them for all the other services of general economic interest, I believe that we need specific directives, alongside the directive governing commercial services in the internal market. I hope not only that the compromise will make it possible to clarify the fact that health services are not in the directive on services in the internal market, but also that we will actually demand a specific directive on health services.

Mr President, Mr President-in Office of the Council, Commissioner, in its debates and conclusions on the Lisbon Strategy, the Council has reoriented its approach to social issues, too. I welcome this, and, in line with what you both said, I believe that the Heads of State or Government are becoming aware of the fact that we will not be able to win back the citizens’ trust if we do not demonstrate that Europe is endeavouring to protect the European social model. The conclusions therefore mention the need not only to create more jobs and to sustain growth, but also to safeguard the quality of jobs, working conditions, worker participation and the reconciling of professional and family life. Quite simply, this calls for two remarks to be made. The first is that, if we do not want this new social approach to go unheeded, it must be accompanied by an action plan, by the re-launch of the European social agenda, and perhaps even by a Council that is dedicated – as the last one was to energy- and renewable energy-related objectives – to the implementation of these social objectives. Quantified objectives should be set, for example in the areas targeted by the Lisbon Strategy: youth employment, over 50s’ employment and access to lifelong learning. The Member States should be made to provide themselves with the resources to get results, for example by exchanging best practices and by making sure to penalise those who do not follow things through. Furthermore, we should release a number of texts that are being held up by the very Council that is responsible for strengthening the Union’s social dimension: the Working Time Directive, the revision of the European Works Councils Directive and the Temporary Work Directive. My second remark is that there must be consistency between this new focus on the Union’s social dimension and all of the policies conducted in other areas. Is the protection of the social model entirely consistent with our desire to completely liberalise the postal sector, together with the electricity and gas sectors? Can these public service sectors be tackled solely from an internal market perspective? Does liberalisation provide us with guarantees regarding public services, the servicing of all territories and the controlling of tariffs? I believe that, on this issue, too, we need to propose a new balance. That is why, as you know, the Socialist Group in the European Parliament has requested that a draft framework directive on services of general interest be looked into.

 Mr President, in Guinea, since 17 January, an old senile dictator has been massacring his people with complete impunity in order to protect his regime, his corrupt friends and his waning power. Guinea is in complete decline. Despite its status as the leading exporter of bauxite and despite its deposits of gold, diamonds and iron, its people are among the poorest in the world. Its wealth is consumed by corruption, and bad governance does the rest. Repression beats down on a people who no longer accept it. President Conté’s only response to the January strikes was to have the crowd fired on, to imprison the trade unionists, then, having pretended to negotiate on 27 January, to go back on his commitment to appoint a consensus prime minister and to declare a state of emergency. There have now been more than one hundred deaths, and the massacre goes on. Europe cannot remain silent and do nothing. We cannot wait for Guinea to descend into chaos with unforeseeable consequences for the region. Europe has a responsibility to fulfil. We call on the Commission to implement the provisions of Article 96 of the Cotonou Agreement, applicable in the event of violation of human rights and democratic principles. We must now support the people of Guinea and demand that the authorities end the massacres immediately, release those arrested during the demonstrations, restore civil liberties, lift the state of siege, open negotiations with the trade unions and civil society, and, in cooperation with the opposition parties, appoint a consensus prime minister and government. Furthermore, I believe that the European Union must call for elections to be convened under international supervision, with missions sent by the European Union and the United Nations. That is what is currently being done in Mauritania, involving our fellow Member, Mrs Isler Béguin, to whom I pay tribute in this House, and it was what was done in the Democratic Republic of Congo, with results that have been extremely effective and significant. Finally, we must indeed support the proposal for an independent committee of inquiry, led by the United Nations, into the violence of recent months. After twenty-three years of dictatorship, enough is enough; the European people must stand alongside the people of Guinea in their fight for freedom and dignity.

 Mr President, we have indeed agreed to withdraw our Amendment 1 in order to maintain a consensus and a unanimity among the groups that, I am delighted to say, will, I believe, strengthen the resolution. With the agreement of the various groups, we have instead submitted an oral amendment to be added at the end of recital D and which I will read to you in English, since that is the language to be used as reference and in which the oral amendment was negotiated. It will specify that intervention is taking place by mercenaries from Liberia and Sierra Leone, currently used by the authorities, but that officially there is not yet absolute proof of such intervention, even if all observers on the ground have begun to note it. In order to refer to the situation while remaining rigorous, we will state the following:  ‘whereas there are allegations of the presence of mercenaries and former guerrilla fighters’.  (FR)
 However, I believe that our fellow Member, Mr Matsakis, wished to make an oral amendment to the oral amendment in order to make it still more precise, and I should like to say straight away that I support the wording that he will now propose to us, so that we may all vote unanimously in favour of the same text.

 Mr President, Mr Almunia, Mr Gloser, I should like to begin by congratulating the rapporteur on his work; I believe that this report presents both an analysis and recommendations that my group can fully support. I should like simply to highlight three aspects. The outlook for the euro zone in terms of growth and competitiveness is improving. However, as the report says – and this is my first remark – there are some very important differences between the Member States. I believe that we should try to learn some lessons from this, or, in any case, try to understand why this is so. Things are not always easy; many elements come into play. In particular, the report mentions the difference between the situation of a number of large Member States and that of smaller ones, but, ultimately, it is more complicated than that, since we can also observe spectacular differences in results among the large Member States. Germany has performed averagely, with 2.7% growth last year, which is a very good result compared with previous years. However, with 2% growth, other large Member States, such as Italy, and also my country, France, are below average in terms of EU growth, something that only happened two years ago. This is combined with other elements that are fairly worrying, since the differences in external trade are just as spectacular. Germany is a record-breaker again, showing an ability to conquer international markets, while France, which for a very long time was a country with a very strong international trade surplus, is producing one record trade deficit after another, quarter after quarter. It is true that the Scandinavian countries, the Netherlands and a number of small Member States have obtained good results in terms of growth, employment and international trade. There is a first lesson to be learnt from this, one that has perhaps come to my mind as a result of my country’s situation. It is that, in a country in which for five years, there has been one, let us say, liberal, structural reform after another, in which it was explained to us that that which was going to enable us to resolve the crisis, and the employment crisis in particular, was to reduce taxes – corporation tax, income tax – to jeopardise some forms of employment protection – we had a 'new employment' contract, which undermined protection against redundancies, etc. – to weaken public services and to privatise, we have not obtained a single result. On the contrary, some countries that have kept compulsory levies and higher labour costs than France are, for their part, showing important results. I have learnt a second lesson from this, which is that not only has this formula been ineffective, but it is wrong to think that Europe will cope if it practices downwards competition. It is not by practising a form of competition based on low costs that Europe will manage to extricate itself, but by investing in human resources, in innovation, in research, in training and in universities. My third remark, and a point rightly noted in the report, is that, despite this overall increase in growth and economic results, poverty continues to be a problem. Even when compared with the 1990s, the level of poverty within the European Union has gone up again. At the end of the day, there are 80 million Europeans living below the 60% average income threshold. On this issue, I believe that we should also learn a lesson from what took place under President Clinton in the United States, which back then experienced a boom with the new economy, a boom that at the same time did not prevent serious poverty from continuing to somewhat poison society, because the Welfare programmes could not be implemented. We too must combine investments with the knowledge-based economy, the competitive economy and social cohesion. The two go hand in hand and support each other.

 Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, thanks to the hard work and determination of our rapporteur Mrs Gebhardt, and thanks to the mobilisation of the European trades union movement, at first reading Parliament removed the main dangers from the initial version of the Services Directive, the version put forward by Commissioner Bolkestein. In particular, Parliament managed to remove from the directive all social services, including social housing, healthcare, audiovisual services, transport and temporary employment agencies. Likewise, the directive on the posting of workers and labour law could not be affected, thus removing the main dangers of social dumping, and the country of origin principle was also deleted. Nevertheless, two major problems remained: firstly, not all services of general economic interest were removed from the scope, due to opposition from the Group of the European People's Party (Christian Democrats) and European Democrats and the Group of the Alliance of Liberals and Democrats for Europe; secondly, the new version of Article 16, whilst removing the country of origin principle, was not clear in establishing the country of destination principle. These problems have not been solved in the Council's common position, which, although it has indeed incorporated the essence of the conclusions from Parliament's first reading, has taken a backward step on several other points, in particular social services and labour law, as the European Trade Union Confederation has underlined. Everyone has acknowledged the need for clarification of these points, and of others, such as the effects on criminal law, the direction taken by the Commission's guidelines and the need for future harmonisation, and you have made a statement to that effect, Commissioner. It would, however, have been more logical, given that the codecision procedure has not been completed, to adopt amendments to clarify these elements within the articles themselves. Unfortunately, I note that the PPE has neutralised the second reading by rejecting all the amendments proposed by the rapporteur during the debate in the Committee on the Internal Market and Consumer Protection. In a way, this group has deprived the European Parliament of its right of amendment, and I find that deplorable. The French Socialist delegation has therefore tabled a number of amendments, because it feels that the compromise is not satisfactory in its current state, and that it leaves the door open to too many uncertainties with regard to the Court's interpretation. I think that, when it comes to distinguishing between liberalisation, on the one hand, and social and fundamental rights, on the other, the role of the legislature is to clarify, and not to leave the door open for case-law.

Madam President, Mr President of the Commission, I believe that the time has come for legal and political clarification of this issue of services of general interest. On the political front, because the debate on public services overshadowed the rest of the European debate, it poisoned the debate on the Constitutional Treaty, and it was blighted by the initial proposal for a directive on services in the internal market, since that proposal included a vast range of social services and services of general economic interest within its scope. The distrust generated by the risk posed to public services by the actions of the Commission or the interventions of the European Union has a long history. It is warranted in many respects, one reason being the failure to strike a fair balance between the rules of the internal market and the preservation of the general public interest; another is the impact of a number of single-sector directives that have not delivered the promised or expected results. I am thinking, for example, of energy-price trends and of certain fears that have been confirmed with regard to postal services. Clarification is also required on the legal side. You emphasised this point yourself a short time ago, Mr President of the Commission, when you listed the legislative initiatives that the Commission has taken recently to try to stabilise the interpretation of the law and the treaties with regard to public funding and the regulation of state aid, passenger transport, financing and compensation, etc. I therefore believe it is wrong to set the need for sectoral initiatives against the need for a general framework in today’s debate. Single-sector initiatives are needed – you referred to some of these yourself – in areas such as health services or social services of general interest, and cross-cutting initiatives are needed too. Why? Because, as you said, one of the principles on which we must base our actions is respect for the right of each Member State and its local authorities to continue to define what they understand by services of general interest and by services of general economic interest. The interpretation of these concepts certainly varies from one Member State to another. The ways in which these services are organised and funded as well as the contours, the delineation, of public service are not the same in all our countries and sometimes even differ between regions within our countries or between local communities. In the absence of legislation, it has fallen to the Court of Justice, and sometimes to the Commission, to interpret the Treaties. The fact is that these interpretations have generated an inconsistent and fluctuating body of case law, which has created legal uncertainty for local authorities, service providers and users. It has also kindled fears that the provision of services of general interest will be jeopardised by a kind of predominance of the forces of the internal market, competition and private operators. That is why we have taken this rather unusual step for a group in the European Parliament of proposing, as a symbolic gesture but also as a political measure, an initiative for the drafting of a framework directive designed to safeguard services of general economic interest. We wanted to demonstrate that, given the necessary political will, a basis could be found in the Treaties and a directive could be formulated to answer the questions that now confront us. From this point of view, may I say the following to Mrs in't Veld: I believe this is precisely the legal framework we need if we are to protect subsidiarity, and that is what we have demonstrated with this draft framework directive. I invite Mrs in't Veld to familiarise herself with this initiative, which is intended to define and protect public services and services of general interest and to guarantee their long-term future. I believe it is up to the legislature to establish the rules at this juncture. It is normal that the European Parliament, representing the people, and the national governments, representing the Member States, should be able to state openly, on the basis of a public debate, how Article 86 of the EC Treaty is to be interpreted and to draw the demarcation line that safeguards the general public interest from the forces of the internal market and competition. Public services, as you said, Mr President of the Commission, are at the heart of the European social model. People are attached to them because they not only enhance their quality of life, enable them to enjoy their fundamental rights and contribute to economic and social cohesion but also make our continent and its territories more competitive. It is therefore a legal as well as a political imperative to show today that the European Union is not hostile to public services, that it is not trying to stifle them, but that it seeks, on the contrary, to preserve, encourage and develop them.

 Mr President, Commissioner, the suspensions of the Doha Round negotiations is first and foremost the breaking of a promise to adjust the balance of trade rules to benefit developing countries. It represents a triumph of the narrow interests of some countries over the broader interest of the international community and, like the chairman of the Committee on International Trade, we are all, of course, thinking about the mid-term elections due to take place in the United States. The suspension already potentially threatens the multilateral system as the main framework of trade negotiations and a return to more imbalanced bilateral negotiations that will act to the detriment of the poorest, and in particular the smallest, countries, as you pointed out, Mr Mandelson. Furthermore, it will leave the multilateral system in place, which will not disappear, though the idea was to begin to reform it and make it more compatible with the objectives of development and with the other rules of the international community: namely the need to take on board the objectives of public health, the environment, and tomorrow – we hope – the social dimension of globalisation. The main losers of this suspension of the round of negotiations will be developing countries, and, of those, the least advanced countries in particular. Irrespective of the shortcomings and the limitations, what was on the table, and what was being proposed by the EU – which was often, indeed, what Parliament wanted to see – will be jeopardised, will be lost: the abolition of export subsidies by 2013, free access, as regards rights and quotas, for products from the least developed countries to the markets of the developed countries, even though the problem remained of the 3% tariff lines that a number of other industrialised countries had sought, increased access to the markets of industrialised countries for all agricultural production in developing countries, even though the US proposals fall well short of what is required, addressing the situation of cotton producers, the trade-related assistance package, and the amendment to the Trade Agreement on Intellectual Property Rights (TRIPS) on access to medicines. I welcome the fact, Commissioner, that you are simply announcing that you are once again going to set forth in search of peace, to meet again with the G20 and the United States and to attempt to find ways to return to the negotiating table. We must not, in my view, allow the Doha Round to die. Whatever the difficulties posed by the expiry of the authorisation to negotiate granted by Congress to the US administration, we must not allow the undertakings and the promises that had been made simply to be thrown out of the window, and I am delighted to hear that, for its part, the EU will honour its commitments and keep its promises. We should perhaps return simply to the heart of the Round and remind our partners from the industrialised countries that we knew that it would not be based on reciprocity, and that we would have to offer more in the way of access for agricultural products than we would gain via industrial tariffs and the opening up of markets and services. Europe must continue to promote the multilateral system. It certainly needs to be reformed so that there can remain a framework of confidence between developing and developed countries. After all, it is within the multilateral system that the developing countries can continue to be heard via the G20 and the G90, and that the trade rules can be made more compatible with the aims of eradicating poverty and with all of the other rules of the multilateral system.

Mr President, as well as Euro-pessimism, another spectre haunts Europe: that of autism and its associated hypocrisy and myths. That spectre fuels the one you mentioned. I too understand the attachment to the Constitutional Treaty on the part of those Member States that ratified it and of the majority of MEPs. Like all those who campaigned for it to be ratified – and I was one of them in France – I remain convinced that it contains some crucial advances with regard to the functioning and the democratic life of the Union. However, we must dispel the myth that, in time, it will be possible to present the same text, accompanied by a simple annex, in the countries in which it was rejected. We must also do away with the hypocrisy of the Member States that have so far been unable to ratify it and that, in actual fact, are quite simply unable to secure a majority, particularly when the people have been promised a referendum. I believe that we need instead to acknowledge this and to try to forge ahead, as you proposed just now, Mr Barroso, because European life cannot be founded on regrets. We need a revival, advances and progress. This revival – – and on this point too, I agree with you – – cannot be limited to the debate on the institutions. It hinges on policies. It hinges on the Europe of projects, on the Europe of growth and knowledge, and on the Europe of research, of energy and of cooperation in the Mediterranean. As regards the institutions, desperately wanting to keep the Treaty as it stands may not be the best way of saving its substance. I think that the period of reflection – – which the Council appears to be spending its time extending – is, rather, in danger of preserving the Treaty in aspic. I believe, in fact, that this exercise will soon reach its limits and that we must instead prepare to go beyond it by proposing a new road map. In order to go beyond it, we will need to do what your predecessor, the current Italian Prime Minister, said yesterday and draft a new and simpler text, which permits limited, but crucial, reforms. As for these reforms, they should be clear and easily understood by Europeans and should mainly focus on improving the democratic functioning of the Union and on clarifying the responsibilities among the institutions. Which reforms? I will mention six of them, and I believe that we should more or less stop there. Firstly, to strengthen the powers of the European Parliament, whose legitimacy is being recognised more and more by Europeans. Secondly, to make the Council's work more transparent when it debates legislative matters, as it is unacceptable that France and the United Kingdom should now place obstacles in the way of this transparency. Thirdly, to ensure that the appointment of the President of the Commission is made by taking into account the votes cast by Europeans during the European elections. Fourthly, to implement a power whereby the national parliaments can monitor compliance with the principle of subsidiarity. Fifthly, to review the rules on qualified majority voting on the basis of what was agreed in the Treaty of 2004, in such a way that they are based on the population. Finally, in fact, to bring in a foreign affairs minister. The Member States have already given their backing to all of these ideas. I am convinced that, in all of our countries, the majority of people would be willing to support these reforms. We need initiatives. Let us attach importance to the substance rather than to the form.

Commissioner, I think, in fact, that when the Commission receives notice of the First Employment Contract, it will be important that it can conduct a precise analysis of the conditions in which this law would authorise allowing the employment contract of young people under the age of 26 to be terminated during the first two years. If, as you have said, directive 2000/78 allows differences in treatment, including on grounds of age, it is within the framework of positive actions, of actions proportionate to the desired objective. Recently, a judgment was delivered by the Court of Justice – Mangold judgment of 22 November 2005 – concerning another piece of legislation, the German ‘Hartz 4’ law, which relates to provisions for older workers. This judgment took the view that, in this case, the way of renewing fixed-term contracts exclusively for these older workers was not proportional to the desired objective. I think that, in the case of the First Employment Contract, nobody believes that the measure in question is favourable to young people under the age of 26. This is therefore clearly an act of discrimination towards them, which denies them the benefit of a number of elements of employment law. I hope that the Commission will rely on Court of Justice case law in order to condemn this First Employment Contract.

Mr President, Commissioner, I should like, first of all, to take my turn in congratulating our rapporteur and to say, following your presentation and the one that Mr Lamy, on behalf of the WTO, came here to make before the Committee on International Trade a few days ago, that we can see that, after Hong Kong, London and Rio, the Doha Round remains in abeyance and that it is even in jeopardy. Admittedly, the round is making progress, but it is not keeping pace with the clock counting down to the moment when the US administration’s negotiating mandate will expire and, unlike in the case of the previous rounds, we do not have the opportunity on this occasion to extend the debates by two or three years, unless we jeopardise the entire multilateral structure. I believe that, if we are enthusiastic about this multilateral framework, we now need to call on each of the parties to make one final effort. After the computer simulations in London, and after the spring-like beginnings or preliminaries in Rio, it is now time to act. In particular, industrialised countries, Europe and the United States must make decisions and commitments and they must make the necessary gestures, because this round is a development round. Admittedly, the G20 countries - the emerging countries - will themselves also have to make a number of concessions in the area of industrial tariffs, but we know that there will be less than full reciprocity. We cannot demand that they jeopardise a number of fragile economic sectors or industrial or service sectors that are still not necessarily ready to be opened up to international competition. I therefore believe that, despite everything, this round deserves to be concluded and I perhaps differ in that regard from some of my friends, such as Mr Agnoletto, who was pointing out its inadequacies a short while ago. There are certainly inadequacies, and the European Union’s energy must be focused on making sure that the commitments made to promote development are respected. Yet, there is also the question of the abolition of export subsidies. The implementation of this process must start before 2013 and, above all, it must be accompanied by a commitment and monitoring mechanism that guarantees that the other industrialised countries, and not just the European Union, move in the direction of abolishing all export subsidies. Developing countries will, all the same, have greater access to the market of wealthy countries for their agricultural produce, and the list of sensitive goods must be reduced. The least developed countries must be able to access the market free from duties and quotas, but a proportion of the 3% of tariff lines that will enable some countries, such as Japan or Australia, to avoid making this effort must be abolished; the TRIPs agreements on access to medications must be amended; and provision must be made for a development package including trade aid that must not be substituted for the aid already provided for in the context of the official development aid earmarked for the Millennium Development Goals.

 Mr President, 2005 was the first year in which the revised Lisbon Strategy was implemented. The strategy is now better known and has been debated in the Member States, and the national reform programmes have been adopted. That is progress, but it is just about the only progress there has been. Otherwise, Mr Winkler was very bold in stating just now that the Lisbon Strategy had been relaunched. In fact, it is somewhat bogged down. It is, as Mr Schulz said, held back by a tiny financial perspective and by anaemic growth within the eurozone, as well as by a flagrant lack of investment – both at European and Member State level – in the universities, research and innovation and lifelong learning. In the same way, we are struggling to complete the trans-European networks, and renewable energy sources and biotechnologies are still the poor relations where our investment and research efforts are concerned. Let us move up a gear, you said, Mr Barroso. Getting into first gear would be a start, I am inclined to reply. If the Lisbon Strategy is to be a success, it needs resources, a coherent financial perspective with defined priorities, investment on the part of each Member State and a macroeconomic framework that genuinely supports growth. As you said, Mr President, there is also, however, a need for people to take the Lisbon Strategy to heart. If the growth strategy defined by the European Union is to succeed, it needs to be supported. That is why we should be doubly mistaken to give up the social dimension of this strategy and let ourselves be taken down the road of all-out liberalisation, precarious employment, enfeebled social rights and undermined public services. To do so would be to weaken the bases of the EU’s future competitiveness and to turn away from a Europe of excellence. It would also be to turn Europeans off the European Union and its policies. The social dimension is not inimical to competitiveness. As we have often mentioned in this debate, the Nordic countries have been able to implement reforms successfully because they have negotiated them and arranged for them to be accompanied both by collective investment in research and innovation and by a new economic flexibility and significant compensation for workers in terms of social benefits, lifelong learning and protection of rights. However, all this presupposes that a high level both of tax deductions and of social redistribution will be maintained. In the same way, Germany has come up with all the aces where exports are concerned and, in common with other European Union countries, has demonstrated that, even with high salary costs and a system of social protection that is among the most efficient in Europe and among the most extensive in the world, it can remain competitive internationally. Let us, then, stop invoking global competition as a way of denigrating the European social model. Let us invoke it with a view to investing more in Europe’s assets, in human capital and in research and innovation. The route to renewed growth is now basically via consumer confidence, an increase in internal demand, a boost to purchasing power and a fairer distribution of income and added value between shareholders and salaried employees. In conclusion, Mr Winkler and Mr Barroso, I should like to say that the European Council will be judged on two counts: on the one hand, the lessons it will draw from Parliament’s vote on the ‘Services’ Directive – there must, emphatically, be no return to Bolkestein – and, on the other hand, freedom of movement for workers from the new Member States within the European Union. It is time to grant them that basic freedom. (Applause)

Mr President, Mr Barroso, Mr Winkler, it is one thing to complete the internal market, which is an objective that we share. Yet, it is quite another thing to dismantle the European social model, which is a move that we strongly oppose. We strongly oppose it because it runs counter to the interests of the citizens and to the interests of workers and of European consumers, but also because it jeopardises citizens’ support for the European project. The initial draft Bolkestein Directive was overwhelmingly rejected because it was seemingly designed to make the completion of the internal market dependent on the reduction of social rights and on the reduction of environmental standards and of the protection of those consumers who had attained a higher level of protection in some Member States than in others. By seeking to base the internal market no longer on competition between businesses, but on competition between the social systems of the various Member States, the Bolkestein proposal has made it seem as though it is playing the Member States’ interests off against one other. It has created a suspicious atmosphere between old and new Member States, running counter to the European Commission’s task, which is to unite all Europeans around a common project. By including many social services and some services of general economic interest in the scope of the directive, the Commission has tried to subject activities that are crucial in terms of social cohesion to nothing other than the logic of competition and of the market. With the country of origin principle, the Commission has turned its back on the Community method, which is aimed at sector-specific harmonisation. It is a method that has always consisted of bringing together the provisions in force in the Member States and is therefore strictly designed to promote mutual recognition and economic integration without jeopardising the European social model and – I repeat – the higher level of protection attained at times in certain countries. It was a question of upwards harmonisation. With this draft, the European Commission has, for the first time ever, proposed a law that, unlike the Community method, encourages the disparity in national laws and rewards the least demanding Member States. Admittedly, the present Commission was not responsible for the initial proposal. Nevertheless, it does have a responsibility: once you recognised that this text was badly thought out and badly put together – as you pointed out, Mr McCreevy – it was your responsibility to withdraw it and to propose another text that was more in keeping with European social principles and liable to restore people’s confidence. That is why the French members of the Socialist Group in the European Parliament will vote in favour of an amendment to reject the text. Mr Barroso, you stated that the Commission was willing to include the amendments that would help us make progress with the internal market in services, but you did not state what you would do with the amendments aimed at safeguarding social rights, environmental standards and consumer law. Nor did you state what you had in store for the amendments that would exclude social services and certain services of general economic interest from the scope of the directive. On the contrary, Mr McCreevy even stated this afternoon that he wanted to retain some services of general economic interest in the scope of the directive. You therefore give the impression of not listening to Parliament or of only listening to it when it comes out in favour of liberalisation. Mr President, Mr Barroso, I will conclude by saying that this afternoon’s demonstration witnessed to the expectation of a Europe that is more protective of the social sphere than is the Commission. Our vote in favour of the compromise will be subject to the exclusion of all public services from the scope of the directive, to the removal of the country of origin principle and to the stipulation of clear legal rules with regard to the applicable law. The compromise currently proposed sadly does not include these changes, and we have therefore tabled amendments along these lines.

Mr President, Commissioner, the principal merit of the agreement reached in Hong Kong is that of maintaining the multilateral system and of not derailing the development round begun in Doha. This agreement, which the Commissioner himself noted is an interim one, is a long way from concluding the round. Much remains to be done. Following Seattle and Cancun, however, a new setback would have opened the door to a proliferation of even more unbalanced bilateral agreements between the North and the South. The aim of the round must continue to be one of ensuring that the trade rules serve development, and this must remain the EU’s goal, even though we know that it will mean us obtaining less than what we offer to our partners in the South, not least where market access is concerned. Commissioner, at times I have been hard on you and the Commission in relation to trade policy. My group and myself will remain vigilant and demanding, particularly with regard to key issues such as public services or the support measures for LDCs and the ACP States. That being said, I should like today, in this House, to pay tribute to the work you have done, not only on keeping the European Parliament delegation constantly up-to-date, but also – and above all – on ensuring that the Member States’ position was coherent in Hong Kong. In saying that, I am thinking, in particular, of the difficult decision that had to be taken in order to reach a unanimous agreement on the elimination of agricultural export subsidies by 2013. It was a long-awaited decision and an important sign – including in terms of supporting and doing more to defend the CAP in the future – even though we know that, as regards agriculture, we still need to break the back of the negotiations on domestic support and market access. You have also shown the flexibility required to prevent a freeze on industrial tariffs and services, a freeze that would have proved fatal for the negotiations. You will need to remain flexible because it is only right that developing countries should want to control open trade and to carry on being able to regulate their public services, and that they should not jeopardise their weakest industries. I have one final comment to make: Hong Kong has demonstrated once again the need for an in-depth reform of the WTO. We have seen once again the extent to which there is still a deep crisis of confidence between industrialised countries and developing countries and the extent to which the clash between national interests constantly threatens the steps taken towards achieving our common objectives: development, the eradication of poverty and fairer trade on an international scale. We will only salvage the multilateral trade system by ensuring that it ties in with the other organisations of the UN system that work towards human development. This will be achieved by counterbalancing free trade with social development objectives, which amounts to guaranteeing that trade rules take account of non-commercial aspects, the environment, public health and social rights.

Mr President, there has been a translation error, so it is the English version that is deemed authentic. By voting in favour of Amendment 3, we are not deleting the part of the sentence in paragraph 13 that states that an exception in the field of services must be made of the health care, education and audiovisual sectors. By voting in favour of Amendment 3, therefore, we are clearly saying that a distinction must be made between commercial and public services and that public services such as water, sanitation and energy must be neither dismantled nor weakened, and we stand by the fact that the education, health care and audiovisual sectors must also be made an exception of.

Mr President, I am afraid there has been a slight mix-up. There is one point on which I agree with Mr Sturdy. Paragraph 19 in fact mentions the agreement on investments, and this is an error, because this paragraph relates to the measures for accessing medicines and, therefore, it is definitely the agreement on intellectual property – the ADPIC Agreement in French and the TRIPS Agreement in English – that should be mentioned and not the TRIMS Agreement, the agreement on investments. That is why we requested a separate vote in order to delete the part of the sentence relating to the agreement on investments. I do not believe that this part of the sentence can be re-inserted at the beginning of the paragraph because this paragraph really has nothing to do with this agreement on investments.

 Mr President, President-in-Office of the Council, Commissioner, we are on the eve of a WTO conference that was supposed to see a real step forward in the implementation of the Doha development agenda, which was adopted in 2001 and was to enable the trade rules to be put at the service of development. As you have just said, Commissioner, it is unfortunately now clear that the Hong Kong conference will not bring the results hoped for in the main areas of negotiation. The progress made following the framework agreement concluded at the WTO on 1 August 2004 has been insufficient, and sometimes almost invisible. A lot of precious time has been lost and the sights for the Hong Kong meeting have now been lowered with the real decisions postponed to a later conference in 2006. On behalf of the Socialist Group in the European Parliament, I would like to stress from the outset that this must not be allowed to result in the development aims of the Doha Round itself being downgraded. Any reduction in the developed countries’ commitments concerning the implementation of the Doha agenda would bring a substantial reduction in the possible gains for the developing countries. As you know, Commissioner, the World Bank has produced a study showing that, if the likely scenario based on the United States’ and the European Union’s present proposals comes about, the main beneficiaries of the Doha Round, as with previous rounds, will again be the major trading powers, the developed countries, while the developing countries will gain by less than 0.2 euro centimes per capita per day; that would cut the number of poor people in the world by scarcely 1%. I also believe that insisting that the developing countries make reciprocal commitments in exchange for the efforts made by the developed countries, in terms of opening their markets in particular, is likely to result in deadlock and from that point of view we must not forget what happened in Cancún. We are convinced that if the Doha Round development talks succeed, maintaining the priority of shifting the balance in favour of the developing countries instead of reciprocity, they will ultimately bring tangible advantages for all, including the European Union, which will share the benefits of renewed world economic growth and the development of new markets for European goods. It is therefore essential that the Doha Round is a success. If that is to be the case, the rules and agreements negotiated in Hong Kong must make for a more equitable sharing of the benefits of globalisation; they must take better account of the different levels of development; they must offer improved market access for the developing countries without forcing them to open their own markets at any price, and on this subject I support the Council’s vision, which seems to me to be slightly different from the Commission’s; they must not weaken the most sensitive economic sectors, nascent industries, but instead contribute to economic diversification; they must recognise the right of the developing countries to control the rate of their commercial opening and their national development strategies. We call on the various players, including the European Union, to be more flexible, Commissioner. I believe you still have room for manoeuvre in agriculture. For example, our Group has tabled an amendment seeking a commitment, with a timetable, to abolish export subsidies by 2010. We are asking that a formula of the ‘Swiss formula’ type, which you are advocating today and which does not respect the principle of ‘less than full reciprocity’, not be applied in the field of industrial tariffs. We must accept the maintenance of a certain level of protection for the developing countries in the industrial field. When it comes to services, we want the European Union’s demands concerning market access for service providers to preserve the rights of all WTO member countries, especially the developing countries, to regulate their services, their public services in particular. We want health, education and audiovisual services to be clearly excluded from the talks, and we do not want public services such as water and energy to be dismantled or weakened in the GATS negotiations. Finally, you have noted the great reticence of the developing countries towards your benchmarking proposal, and it would be more reasonable to withdraw it. We support you on the ‘development aid’ package. There needs to be a sustainable solution for access to medicines that includes a revision of the intellectual property agreement itself. The rules for special and differential treatment must be strengthened. Finally, there really is a need for a financial facility to underpin technical assistance and the strengthening of the poor countries’ capacities. Finally, our Group believes that sensitive issues like social and environmental questions cannot be kept out of the WTO talks. Otherwise, public opinion will not support the multilateral system; it will only survive if it is reformed.

 Mr President, Mr Barroso, Mrs Wallström, Mr Blair, ladies and gentlemen, many Europeans are concerned not only about the path taken by globalisation, as Mr Blair said, but also about the path taken by European policies. They now believe that Europe is not really protecting them against the worst effects of international competition and sometimes even that these policies are attacking their social rights. The Hampton Court summit must respond to these concerns; it must send a clear signal that the European people are determined to defend their social model and therefore to stop setting it in opposition to competitiveness. No, contrary to what the Prime Minister claimed before this Parliament in Brussels four months ago, it is not the European social model that is responsible for the 20 million unemployed in Europe, it is the weak growth in the large countries in the Eurozone, the lack of coordination between the budgetary and monetary policies, which do not support internal demand and investment, and the lack of investment in research and innovation. On this latter point, I see that we are in agreement. I also note, however, that you have given up on this rhetoric, which was supposed to be a boost to your presidency but which has instead lead to stagnation, to a degree of isolation and to the risk of getting bogged down. Indeed, it is not by destroying the social model that we will restore the competitiveness of our economies and create confidence in Europe, but rather by placing the emphasis on Europe’s strengths, on the quality of its infrastructure, including the communication and energy infrastructure, as you mentioned, on the skills of the workforce, on better coordination between research centres and universities, on a common industrial policy in the sectors of the future. That is why we would prefer to emulate the policies pursued by the Nordic countries: more investment in research, more rights to life-long training, maintenance of a high level of solidarity and redistribution, and high-quality public services. Their success shows that there is, in terms of competitiveness, an alternative to the destruction of collective protection systems and a reduction in the level of solidarity. They show that reform is not necessarily synonymous with regression. Reform and modernisation of our social systems will only be accepted and understood by the citizens if they bring new protection, new opportunities and new weapons for all to face competition, change and globalisation. If reform and modernisation mean aligning our social systems and our economies with the harshest market economies, this will contribute neither to the confidence of the citizens nor to support for the reforms. That is why it is vital to negotiate them with the social partners, and to relaunch the social dialogue, with the aims of harmonising rights to the highest level and ruling out social dumping between Member States, and that is why we are in favour of an internal market in services, but against the Bolkestein directive, which is aimed less at an internal market in services than at a weakening of the social model and of services of general interest. Finally, there will be no dynamic Europe without an ambitious financial perspective. It is vital to reach an agreement within the Council without further delay, particularly for the Member States, and we are delighted at the announcement of an agreement on a number of directives adopted by Parliament at first reading and now blocked: the Working Time Directive - but we hope that this agreement takes the same direction as the European Parliament’s vote at first reading, in other words abolishes the opt-out, and I am sure you will tell us if this is the case – the Temporary Agency Workers Directive, the revision of the European Work Councils Directive to increase employees’ rights when faced with restructuring, and, finally, the drafting of a framework directive on services of general interest. With regard to deregulation measures ... (The President cut off the speaker)

 Mr President, Commissioner, in the course of this debate you have received a few congratulations and many criticisms. I think that, above and beyond all the polemic, this is due to Parliament’s grave concern regarding the future of the textile industry and above all, which is the striking aspect of this matter, due to the perceived lack of foresight on the part of the Commission and of the Member States. True, you have mentioned an unprecedented increase in volume, but this increase in import volumes was anything but unpredictable. Everyone knew what we were dealing with regarding the end of the multi-fibre agreement and the lifting of quotas on 1 January this year. Consequently, I cannot understand why we had to wait for so long for the Commission to react. We had the option of bringing safeguard clauses into play, which is permitted under the WTO’s rules. It was not at all necessary to wait for agreement from the Chinese, nor to wait until June. Furthermore, we also question the conditions under which the protocol signed on 10 June has been implemented and the way in which we ended up in this imbroglio of 85 million products piled up in Customs and breaches of the quotas agreed for 2005. How is it that appropriate measures were not provided for when the agreement was signed and what guarantee do we have that the conditions of this agreement can be kept for the two and a half years to which you referred and which are supposed to give the sector time to organise its restructuring. The professional textile and clothing association has signalled the loss of 165 000 jobs since the beginning of the year and projects that one million jobs will be put at risk by the end of the year. Can you confirm these figures? What measures does the European Commission intend to take? Can the restructuring fund, which was defended by Mr Špidla and the previous Commission, be used to help the employment areas and businesses worst affected? Finally, several speakers have referred to the structural problems now posed by competition with China, which distorts competition in reality, according to the WTO’s rules: export subsidies and hidden aid, such as the provision of electricity or interest-free loans given to state-owned businesses by state-owned banks. We could also ask ourselves whether it is time to raise the question, along with the other partners of the European Union within the WTO that are targeted by this increase in Chinese imports – Bangladesh, Turkey, Tunisia and Morocco – of fundamental social standards. Does the Commission intend to talk to these partners and to put these subjects on the negotiating table, particularly at the Ministerial Conference in Hong Kong?

 Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, I believe that the controversy sparked off by this directive is disproportionate and, at the same time, undoubtedly reveals two different approaches to the policy that the EU must conduct on protecting workers’ rights. I do not believe, Mr Mann, that protecting workers’ health puts jobs at risk. As Mr Őry pointed out, this proposal for a directive is simply the fourth part of a set of laws on which Parliament and the Council have already expressed opinions and which is aimed, from a health and safety perspective, at protecting workers against the risks connected with exposure to physical agents. As you know, we have already adopted provisions relating to vibrations, noise and electromagnetic fields. In the present case, we are led to draw a distinction between radiation from artificial sources and that from natural sources. At the same time, however, there is an element of obscurity – if you will excuse the terminology – in your speeches and reasoning concerning health and, in particular, public health policies: you draw no distinction between the risk to which someone – in this instance, a worker – is exposed because of natural rays and that to which he or she is exposed because of artificial radiation. Even if the provisions proposed in the common position do in fact take account of the difference between standing in front of a machine and being exposed to solar radiation due to outdoor work, we need specific policies for each eventuality, even if we do consider that, in the end, what has been implemented by the Community under Article 137 of the Single Act should be enough. In other words, we should take steps to ensure that health and safety measures are laid down for the purpose of protecting all EU workers in their work places. Not to do so would be to give up, and that is something we cannot do. There is a new risk. There is data that cannot be ignored from both the World Health Organisation and our national health bodies, showing that the number of cancers linked to exposure to the sun is on the increase. It is increasing, in particular, in occupations involving exposure to the sun, something that cannot be explained merely in terms, for example, of the variables of holidays and other free time. There is exposure to the sun in the construction, civil engineering and tourist industries. Police in charge of security are also very often out of doors. A much longer list of the occupations concerned could be drawn up. We therefore have a responsibility, and the proposal being made is reasonable inasmuch as it takes account of companies’ need to be able to meet this type of obligation at low cost. It is a question of information, training, assessment and prevention. It is, in actual fact, a question of laying down obligations for employers, because the fact is, workers are dependent upon their employers. Some people maintain that the proposal is too precise and that the Community and the European Union will make themselves look ridiculous. My own observation is that, in the economic field, legislation can never be too precise. When it comes to financial regulations, the internal market or the banking sphere, we are adept at voting in favour of precise standards. The point is, we need, I think, also to be capable of being precise when it comes to people’s health. We do not agree with the notion whereby European standards and rules have to be compulsory in the economic field but whereby subsidiarity and opt-out clauses need systematically to be invoked when it comes to social rights and to the protection of workers’ health. That is why we do not want the content of this legislation to be distorted and why, where prevention and the provision of information are concerned, we want all EU workers to be offered standards such as will help combat the development of skin cancer.

 Mr President, I am delighted to see you in the chair for your first sitting, inasmuch as your appointment to this post is connected to some excellent news for my group and for European socialists: the victory of the socialists in Portugal. Mr President, Commissioner, like my fellow Member, Mr Henin, I am one of the authors of this question to the Commission. A few weeks ago, we received here a delegation of employees of the Alstom group made up of representatives of both French and German trade unions from the two sites of this subsidiary that specialises in boilers. These workers are now affected by the announcement made by their management on 16 February 2005, of the closure of the company or, at any rate, of major cuts in jobs and activities, both in Stuttgart and in Vélizy: 150 jobs out of 350 will be lost in Stuttgart, and 150 out of 200 in Vélizy. This means that, in the end, these two sites will probably be doomed. A few months ago, on 7 July 2004, the European Commission approved aid granted by France to Alstom subject to strict disvestment conditions but with the aim, not only of re-establishing sound competition conditions, but also of safeguarding the long-term future of the Alstom industry and of its various subsidiaries. The subsidiary Alstom Power Boiler, as has already been mentioned, is a company that specialises in the construction of power station boilers. It is a technological leader in Europe, and in the world, in a number of fields, particularly in difficult and clean combustion and CO2 capture. From the point of view of the European Union’s priorities in terms of the Lisbon strategy, which we have debated recently and which will serve to ensure that Europe develops its competences and its technology and becomes the most competitive economy in the world, and also from the point of view of our objectives with regard to sustainable development and clean energy, this company is a strategic tool, and the fact is that, obviously, many jobs depend on it. That is what justified the agreement given by the Commission in July 2004 to a considerable quantity of aid: EUR 3 billion granted by France to the Alstom group to help with its restructuring. In its final decision, the Commission stated that, with regard to the Power Generation and Transport sectors, the restructuring plan was adequate to ensure industrial recovery. It considered the planned job cuts to be proportional to the level of over-capacity in these industries, and felt that the estimates of the costs of this restructuring and of the saving that would result seemed realistic. Today, though, the group’s management is going beyond the job cuts announced at that time, and is going beyond the disvestments to which it committed itself. Consequently, I think that the European Commission needs to take an interest in the decisions that have just been taken by the management of the Alstom group. Indeed, as the Commission is always very scrupulous with regard to compliance with the competition rules after aid has been granted, it must be equally scrupulous with regard to the consequences for employment. After all, unless I have misunderstood, Commissioner, it seems to me that the ultimate justification for granting aid for the restructuring of a business is to keep this activity going, particularly and ultimately because it makes it possible to save jobs, because it generates a multitude of benefits, tax revenue, etc., but above all because it makes it possible to save jobs. The Commission cannot be hemiplegic – it cannot, having granted aid, only look at the effects on competition and respect for competition. It must also ensure that this aid actually does contribute to maintaining activities and employment on all sites, insofar as it was indeed decided, when this aid was approved in July 2004, that the planned job cuts were adequate and that it is therefore not justified to go beyond that. We are therefore now counting on the Commission to ensure that jobs are safeguarded and that the two sites in question are not closed down.

 Mr President, Mr President of the Commission, Mr Vice-President, first of all I should like to thank my co-rapporteur, Mr Klaus-Heiner Lehne, for the work which we did together on the preparation of the motion for a resolution on which Parliament will be voting today. I am also pleased to have heard already, in the remarks of the President and the Vice-President of the Commission, an echo of what our resolution expresses. In recent years the European Union has acquired a currency of its own, has been enlarged, and has adopted a draft Constitution; in other words, broadly speaking, it has established its framework. Now, however, the substance of its policies does not match up to its citizens’ expectations. That is why it has to concentrate on growth, on employment, on social and territorial cohesion, not only because these are the very objectives of this process of building Europe – now that peace is assured – but also because they are the prerequisites for the public’s support for the political plans for the construction of Europe, as Mr Martin Schulz has reminded us. That is why we believe that it is important to state that the Lisbon strategy must be the Union’s priority over the next five years. We believe that this strategy is the right one, provided that it is taken seriously, in other words provided that it is effectively implemented in the Member States in the three dimensions defined at the 2000 Summit under the Portuguese Presidency. Our objective must be to put our money on European competitiveness and growth, by basing them on the elements of the European model and not – as we sometimes have the impression that you are doing, Mr President, when you mention your three threads – by setting one of those three threads against the other two. We think that we can only properly serve the interests of economic competitiveness by looking after the social and environmental aspects equally well. We do not believe that Europe has a future as a low-cost competitor. I am delighted to hear you mention the need to put our money on excellence, high-quality training for the labour force, human capital, research, and the quality of infrastructures and public services. These are advantages which will ensure that investors back the European Union. It is because the European Union’s products will be based to a greater extent on technology, know-how and eco-innovation that they will find their place in the world markets. It is because we are relaunching growth on that basis that we shall have the resources to finance effectively a high level of training, distribution and social cohesion within the Union and in particular the enlarged Union. There is therefore a battle to be fought, and clarifications to be made. In fact – and I welcome the fact that in this Parliament, essentially, by means of our motion for a resolution, we have managed to avoid these pitfalls – there are a certain number of people who would like to see the Lisbon strategy reduced to a sort of magic formula, a programme of wholesale liberalisation: liberalisation of the services market, liberalisation of the employment market, and liberalisation of pension schemes, as if that was enough in itself to ensure the relaunching of European growth and of competitiveness. In my view, not only is that rather limited, but it is also completely beside the point. Europe needs reforms, and we are all agreed on that. It needs to adapt and to have a more dynamic economy, but it also needs investment, it needs to restimulate internal demand, and it needs to coordinate its efforts and to concentrate them on what can, in future, constitute its wealth and its opportunity in international competition. That is why our resolution puts the emphasis on a financial perspective which is consistent with the Lisbon strategy, in other words the doubling of the European research budget and constant effort as regards the major trans-European networks, social cohesion and regional policy. That is why our resolution puts the emphasis on an ambitious social agenda which must be integrated into this overall strategy, and on the fact that the road map which you have presented to us – the legislative and budgetary action plan – must relate to the three dimensions of the Lisbon strategy. At the moment we have the feeling that there is still a lack of balance, that most of the specific proposals concentrate on competitiveness, the economy and structural reforms, and that there is a lack of incentives, information and legislative initiatives in the area of social cohesion and on environmental issues. For example, we now want to see a real draft framework directive on services of general interest. We would like to see a reform of the European Works Councils, in order to enable us to say that the quality of employer-employee relations in Europe is part of our development strategy. In the area of eco-innovations, we should like to see more specific initiatives, and we are pleased to note that, finally, industrial policy linked to innovation and aid for small and medium-sized enterprises has been included in the Commission’s programme. That is the essence of the message which will be expressed by the European Parliament. I am delighted that we have achieved very broad agreement once again thanks to the work of Mr Daul, Mr Lehne and Mrs Thyssen. I am sorry that a certain number of other groups on the Left feel unable to join us, on the basis of the content of this resolution. I can understand that there are still differences, but I can quite honestly say that I believe we have managed to come up with a clear, strong message which is in line with a Lisbon strategy which contributes to the European social model.

Mr President, I would first of all like to say how delighted I am that a debate with the Commission, represented by yourself, Mr President of the Commission, can take place in this Parliament the day after the World Social Forum and the World Economic Forum. I believe that it is a sign of recognition by this House of the World Social Forum which, when it was created in 2001, was portrayed by many as an ineffective gathering for challenging globalisation. In reality, social forums and the movements that promote them have revolutionised the debate on globalisation. They have popularised many issues and positive proposals which are now debated in all international bodies including, increasingly, within the World Economic Forum in Davos. When I say that, I am thinking about access to global public assets, the creation of global taxes, the cancellation of debt, the reform of the international financial institutions and the latter’s need for transparency. I believe that one of the other important contributions of the social forums has been to root the challenge to liberal globalisation, to the economic and social injustices it creates and to its often destructive consequences for the ecological balance of the planet, not in the false belief that national or sovereigntist solutions had to be found, and not in a rejection of the very idea of globalisation, but in the view that globalisation and its rules and institutions must be transformed, in order to allow for a different kind of globalisation, a globalisation of solidarity, of democratic triumphs and of human rights, a globalisation that guarantees the right of all peoples to development, justice and peace. For the European Union, this new world civil society is a source of support, because its aspirations coincide with objectives that the Union has established for itself at international level. However, it is not enough to take pleasure in its emergence. Our policies and decisions should reflect its demands and its aspirations in practical ways. So we must demonstrate that Europe can make a difference, as you have said. We must demonstrate – and we are doing so in certain fields, such as with the Kyoto Protocol, which you have mentioned – that we really are able to transform international policies. In the social field, as in other fields, such as those we have just been talking about, declarations of love are not enough; we also need demonstrations of love. Today, 21 Member States have not yet fulfilled their promise to provide 0.7% of gross domestic product in development aid. A global tax is today being discussed. I am pleased about that, and many Member States have signed the New York declaration of September 2004, but unfortunately the reticence of some nations is being used as an excuse not to take any decision. I would, therefore, like to make the following proposal: that the Union, by means of the Commission, should help those Member States that wish to commit themselves by means, if necessary, of enhanced cooperation, so that they do not remain blocked by the reticence of some nations to implement, from now on, a tax dedicated to international development funding. It could be used in the fight against AIDS, because a recent Council document indicates that, if nothing is done between now and 2010, a fifth of the active population in five of the developing countries most affected is going to disappear. Take the initiative, Mr President of the Commission. Show that Europe can indeed move on from statements to actions.

 Mr President, Mr President-in-Office of the Council, Mr President of the Commission, you recently stated, Mr Juncker, and indeed you repeated just now, that competitiveness will be neither the Holy Grail nor the be all and end all as far as you are concerned, in particular with regard to the mid-term review of the Lisbon strategy. You noted that social goals and sustainable development goals should not be placed in opposition to goals relating to competitiveness. My group welcomes this statement, as we believe the opposite to be true, namely that promotion of the European model is a major driving force behind competitiveness on our continent. In fact, we believe that what is needed is a Europe of excellence which attaches priority to investment in research, innovation, employee training, the quality of infrastructures, trans-European networks, public services, the quality of work and social relations. We agree with you on this issue, and we sometimes detected a slight difference of approach to that adopted by the President of the Commission. We hope that he will be equally clear in his statements, especially with regard to social issues. Yet the good intentions you have professed to hold will be put to a number of tests. I should like to mention three such tests, the first of which is the European budget. We share your view that this debate must not be allowed to get bogged down and that it must progress rapidly. You intend to act as a motivating and intermediary force, as well as one that accelerates the process, but we do not want the process of reaching a compromise on the Financial Perspectives to be accelerated if this would mean sacrificing a budget that meets the European Union’s needs. We agree with Mr Barroso on this issue; we need a budget that enables us to guarantee cohesion, solidarity, investment in the future and in research and investment in the trans-European networks. The process should not be accelerated at the expense of the final outcome. The second test will be the directive on services of general interest, which has already been mentioned today by a number of speakers, in particular Mr Turmes. I believe that you yourself are aware of a risk that is a cause of great concern to us, namely the extended scope of this directive, which poses a threat to a large number of services of general interest. We are also concerned by the country of origin principle, which poses a threat to the right to work in multiple countries; I am thinking in particular of the application of collective bargaining agreements. The third test relates more generally to the European social agenda. We would particularly like to see a clear commitment on your part in relation to other Council members regarding a review of the Directive on Working Time and a removal of the opt-out clause, and, finally, regarding a proposed review of the Directive on European Works Councils.

Mr President, in the introduction to your speech, Mr President of the Commission, you said that it was important to demonstrate that Europe could make a difference. We share this aim, in particular as regards growth and employment, and, in order to restore confidence among the citizens of the European Union, the Union must clearly demonstrate its capacity to revive our economy. The debate will, of course, revolve around the strategy and the means for restoring our competitiveness. When you present your proposals in January, our group will be listening particularly attentively to your Commission’s choice of economic strategy. In this context, a number of speeches have referred to a link between the economic dimension, the social dimension and the environment, which is, I believe, no more than rhetoric and masks a real difference in approach. In our view, it is the Lisbon strategy that represents the path to follow. You mentioned the objective of a competitive, knowledge-based economy and we go along with that. We believe that, in choosing an economic strategy, we are choosing a social model and if we choose an economic strategy that is only based on liberalisation, this will be at the expense of the social model. We do not subscribe to the idea that the social aspect will simply follow on later. I shall naturally refer to the example of the directive on services. If the price to be paid for developing the internal market in services is that our social services – our health services – are to be deregulated, that a number of services of general interest are to be put at risk and that employment law is under threat as a result of the country of origin rule, then I do not believe the return of competitiveness will in itself allow us to retain elements of the European social model. The Clinton years in the United States showed that it is possible to have economic growth rightly based on investment in the knowledge economy and in new technologies, but without pulling the social model up with it, since the President did not, at that time, have a majority in Congress or political support for the implementation of a social policy that would provide for such a balance. We believe, on the contrary, that investment in social aspects, investment in public services and infrastructure and high environmental standards can be factors of production and competitiveness and can contribute towards success in international competition from the European Union’s point of view. We are therefore serious about this interdependence of the economy, social aspects and the environment. We could give examples of this and we shall do so in the dialogue with you in January. The need to increase the employment rate and the rate of labour participation will accordingly be among the subjects raised. Let us look at the sections of society worst affected. Women constitute one such category. It is in those countries that have invested in public amenities, such as crèches and in training that the employment rate among women tends to be higher. . We could also mention other vulnerable sections of society, such as the many children from disadvantaged, in particular immigrant, backgrounds, who not only face racism and discrimination but also suffer from gaps in their education. What must also be borne in mind is the need to reduce frictional unemployment and the fact that there have been a number of successes, for example in the Scandinavian countries, achieved thanks to investment in training. I also believe that you will have to prove that you are capable of improving the quality of social dialogue, which will ensure greater involvement among employees in their companies’ development. Against this backdrop, we also await an initiative with regard to the revision of the directive on European works councils, which is now experiencing enormous delays compared to the other directives on information and consultation.

 The Council has received the Kok report on revision of the Lisbon strategy. The progress made with this strategy lags a long way behind the objectives set in 2000, something which is down to the fact that far too many priorities were set. Advances have been made on all aspects relating to the Community method, or liberalisation, whereas no progress has been made with any aspects which required the commitment of the Member States and which depended on the open method of coordination, such as investment in research, innovation, training, the quality of social dialogue and human capital. Greater national ownership has also not been achieved, and much remains to be done in this field. We are delighted that the need to maintain a balance between the three dimensions of the Lisbon strategy, the economic, social and environmental dimensions, has been reiterated, and it is our belief that the European economy needs a higher level of growth and competitiveness in order to preserve the European environmental and social model. Yet we must continue to discuss the links between these dimensions and the conditions required for sustainable growth in Europe. There appears to be a growing temptation to take the easy way out, namely to have recourse to liberalisation in an ever increasing number of areas, including services, the labour market and welfare systems. If we carry on down this path, there will soon be little left over of the European model, of its uniqueness, its strengths and its advantages, which lie not in a downward adjustment towards the social level of some of our new international competitors – and here I have China and India in mind – but in competition to achieve excellence, quality, top-of-the-range products and innovation. This is why we are sure that investments in human capital, in a high standard of lifelong employee training, in quality of public services, in European environmental standards and in good social dialogue are all productive factors, competitive factors and prerequisites for ensuring that reforms are adopted as and when they are needed. This is why these things do not merely entail costs, expenses and inflexibility, but instead provide support to ensure the success of a new growth and development strategy for the European Union. We want growth and jobs to be a priority, and I believe that this also involves better links between all European policy instruments, or in other words a reform of the Stability and Growth Pact to ensure that it has tighter links with the broad outlines of economic policy, the new financial perspective and, indeed, the revised Lisbon objectives.

 Mr President, I should like to ask whether paragraph 1, upon which we are about to vote, was originally tabled in English.

 Mr President, Commissioner, Mr President-in-Office of the Council, as Mr Schulz has just said, my group fully supports the proposal that Commissioner Almunia has put forward. It breaks the taboo on tampering with the Pact as initially defined and suggests that you be pragmatic in learning the lessons of the first five years of the EMU’s operation. This it does in order to usher in a new period in the history of the single currency, which makes it possible, in reality, to combine stability with the prioritisation of growth and employment. The present framework has not only shown itself to be deficient as an instrument of growth in comparison with the performances of the world’s other major currency areas, including those of the EU Member States that remained outside the eurozone; it has also shown itself to be vulnerable in terms of its own credibility, bearing in mind not only the number and the size of the Member States that have broken its rules, but also the uncertainty prompted by the decision of November 2003, which the Court of Justice’s ruling in July really did nothing to allay. So it is that we endorse your proposals, particularly those about taking better account of the link between debt, deficit, economic cycles and countries’ specific situations in order to get away from the ‘one size fits all’ approach; we also endorse the emphasis you place on prevention, on early warnings, on peer pressure, and, finally, on anticipating events rather than simply relying on the sanctions machinery. My group, however, would insist on two other items, which my colleagues will address, as it seems to us that additional measures are needed. Reform of the Pact must have as its primary objectives growth and employment, an increase in which will contribute to stability – or, to be more precise, will give the eurozone a real basis for stability – and will be achieved by making a link, which is de facto absent at the moment, between reform of the Pact, the Lisbon strategy, coordination and the Member States’ economic policy guidelines. Specifically, then, we think that the issue that has to be addressed is that of how to encourage investment in growth and how to take into account, in a nuanced way, those investments that contribute to the Lisbon strategy and to achieving its objectives, namely research, innovation, infrastructures and the major trans-European networks, without forgetting lifelong learning. Secondly, we also have concerns about the long-term nature of debt and, at the same time, we are concerned to ensure that taking account of ageing does not become a pretext for propelling Member States towards the privatisation of their social security systems, pension schemes in particular. We would prefer this to be clarified and this argument not to be used tomorrow in an attempt the bottom line of which is to reduce social protection and social security that the people of Europe enjoy.

 Mr President-in-Office of the Council, your Presidency will have to prepare the mid-term review of the Lisbon Strategy. The least that one can say is that the European Union is a long way from achieving its objective of becoming, by the year 2010, the most competitive knowledge-based economy in the world. On the contrary, throughout Europe there is growing concern about businesses relocating, about workers being blackmailed into accepting longer working hours, and about continuing unemployment. The recovery is all the more fragile for not being based either on internal demand or on sustained public investment; instead, it remains exposed to the impact of external factors such as the rise in the value of the euro and the increase in the price of oil. More than ever, Europe needs a strategy for sustainable growth and employment, and for investment in research, in major trans-European networks, in education, in knowledge and in the environment. It needs economic and social cohesion. It needs the Lisbon Strategy. Yet certain people are trying to use the present economic slow-down as a pretext to return to an ultra-liberal programme, and to destroy the achievements of Lisbon and the integration of the various economic, social and environmental dimensions into the policies of the Union. In that respect, your Presidency’s priorities cause us great concern. You say that you support the Lisbon Agenda, and we have heard you say so. Yet your priorities – and here again we have read what you have written and we have heard what you have said – show that your approach is very unilateral and does not take into consideration the coherence of the Lisbon Agenda, which comprises the liberalisation of the market, in particular in the services sector, deregulation, and the reduction of administrative costs. As for the financial perspectives – another major area for action during your Presidency – you want to restrict the Union’s budget to 1% of GDP. Yet such an initiative is incompatible not only with the efforts which have to made in research, and on the subject of which Romano Prodi has put forward some proposals, but also with the policy of territorial cohesion in the new enlarged EU. You reject any revision of the pact to take more account of economic cycles and, in particular, public-investment requirements. As far as you are concerned, public-investment policies, employment regulations and environmental regulations are really no more than obstacles, unnecessary burdens and restrictions on growth. We, on the other hand, believe that all these things make the EU more competitive, and we also believe that respect for the integrity of the Lisbon Agenda will be a test of your Presidency’s success and will determine what support we shall be able to give it.

Here we are at the end of a lengthy and laborious process. We have got as much out of the Council as it could give us. We have reinstated what we felt was essential in the text, and to our surprise and pleasure we have to admit that almost all our new proposals have been accepted. Of course we would have been happier if we could have reined in the private broadcasters and operators when it comes to the liberalisation of advertising. Of course we would have preferred product placement to be prohibited. Of course we would have preferred a firmer stance on children’s advertising. But this was, clearly, not the position of the majority in this House or in the Council. Because the audiovisual media services need this new legislation as soon as possible, and because we have to admit that the Council and the German Presidency provided open and, in the end, productive cooperation, we can now say that the glass is half full. The Socialist Group therefore supports the proposal to approve the text resulting from the negotiations.

Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, with the convergence of television, telecommunications and the internet the television has become an interactive medium and TV viewers have become ‘actors’. The viewer can now research content, select programmes and react to broadcasts; however, to do this requires an ever growing number of devices. In order to facilitate the use of this equipment and to avoid additional costs for the consumer these devices need to be able to communicate with each other and work together. This is what is known as ‘interoperability’. The report being presented today seeks to promote interoperability within the European Union. It is also aimed at ensuring respect for pluralism of information and diversity of content in the new technological era, which requires an active, steadfast and vigilant policy on the part of the public authorities at both national and European level.

 Madam President, I too should like to thank Mrs Hieronymi for both the quality and the quantity of her work. The directive proposed to us would enable us to retain the European audiovisual model in the new technological and economic conditions. Advertising is still limited to 12 minutes per hour. The Committee on Culture and Education has voted in favour of maintaining the period of time between two advertising slots at 45 minutes and of not reducing it to 35 – or, even worse, 30 – minutes, as desired by the Commission. I hope that this amendment, supported by the Socialist Group in the European Parliament, will be adopted in plenary. The advertising revenue from which television channels benefit should not suffer thereby as, in our world of globalisation and of the proliferation of transnational enterprises, the demand for advertising is expanding and will continue to do so. Product placement is banned. That is the first thing to say. Admittedly, exceptions are possible when it comes to cinema films, television dramas and sports programmes but, in those cases, product placement is strictly regulated in order to prevent the abuses and pernicious effects noted in many countries, particularly the United States. The regulations are extended, in appropriate forms, to the new audiovisual services. I am thinking, in particular, of video on demand, which has a great future ahead of it. Minors, consumers and people in general are protected against incitement to all forms of discrimination and hatred. We note with satisfaction that the new services will also have to play their part in supporting the production and promotion of European works. With an eye to a number of audiovisual enterprises possibly circumventing the regulations of the Member States, the Socialists propose simpler and fairer provisions that can be implemented more quickly so that countries that are victims of indecent channels or services are better able to defend themselves. This compromise text, voted in favour of by the Committee on Culture and Education, preserves what is essential. It can and must be improved, and that is the purpose of our amendments.

Mr President, on 20 October 2005, the Unesco General Conference adopted the Convention on the Protection and Promotion of the Diversity of Cultural Expressions by 148 votes in favour to two against with four abstentions. This convention recognises the specific nature of cultural activities, goods and services that can under no circumstances be regarded as mere commodities. Article 20 stipulates that the countries must pay heed to the convention when they subscribe to other international obligations, such as the agreements concluded in the context of the World Trade Organisation. This convention must be ratified by 30 countries before it can enter into force. To date, Canada is the only country to have ratified it. The European Union, represented by its Commission, has played a major role in the adoption of the convention. Ought not our President, together with the chairman of the Committee on Culture and Education, write a letter to the Council and to all the Heads of State or Government urging them to ratify the convention?

Mr President, a short while ago we received a delegation representing the port workers who held a massive demonstration today in our town. Trade union representatives have condemned the violent acts carried out by a few uncontrolled elements, right here in Strasbourg and towards our Parliament, but they have drawn our attention to the dangers posed by the port services Directive with regard to the status of port workers, and to the quality and security of port services. The representatives have called on MEPs to do as they did two years ago and reject this directive that is both pointless and harmful, when it comes back to Parliament. This directive is both harmful and pointless because, as the port workers have pointed out, European port services are the most competitive in the world, and there is no need to intensify competition in our ports.

Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, the ‘Television without Frontiers’ Directive is, without doubt, one of the success stories of the European Union. In 1989, when the first text was adopted, there were only about 50 television channels in Europe. Today, there are 50 times that many. The audiovisual landscape has been changed radically by satellite, cable, digital, the Internet and the mobile telephone. New media, new broadcasting methods and new services have appeared. There is therefore a crucial and urgent need to revise and extend the directive. Mrs Reding has announced that she will present these proposals to us in autumn. I take advantage of this occasion to congratulate her on her commitment to European television and to thank her for the attention she has clearly given to professionals from the sector. I invite her to pay attention to the three parts of this report, to our thoughts on the application of Articles 4 and 5, to the paths we propose for the revision of the Directive and to the significant problem posed by media concentration. With regard to Articles 4 and 5, the results are good and these measures must be upheld. They are the minimum standards satisfying the most people and it is advisable not to downgrade them, even if pressure is growing to reduce regulation. We can, however, propose improvements when it comes to defining the concepts of ‘independent producer’ and ‘work’ or to establishing a more standardised grid of the results of the Member States, for example. Revising the directive is not easy. We must find the right balance so that the audiovisual sector does not become a purely commercial sector to the detriment of cultural diversity. At the same time, however, we must not hinder the development of a sector in the throes of a continuous technical revolution, which is very important for our industries and for our jobs. The standards laid down by the directive are minimal as it is, and they have not always prevented a slide towards commercialism and mindlessness in certain Member States. Unfortunately, the numerous interviews I have been able to have demonstrate that the general mood is such that the level of regulation will decrease under the combined pressure both of the industries and advertising and also of a number of Member States. That is why, together with my colleagues, I call for the legal basis chosen to be one that allows this text to be overseen by the Committee on Culture and Education. Without wishing to create hostilities, I am afraid that another committee might tackle this text from a more commercial than cultural angle. The proposals that I am submitting are not intended to deviate from the principles of the current Directive, which is based largely on self-regulation and which is not overly prescriptive. It does not deviate, either, from the two previous reports by our institution, including the one by my fellow MEP, Mrs Hieronymi. This revision of the Directive must enhance a number of fundamental principles: free movement of European television broadcasts, free access to exceptional events, promotion of European works and recent independent productions, protection of minors and public order and protection of consumers thanks to the identification of content providers and to transparency in advertising and the right of reply. It must also promote the movement of national works in every country of the Union. We produce a great deal. We exchange too little among Europeans. We must remedy this shortcoming. We must also encourage European content to be shown on television. That can of course be promoted through the Media (Plus) programme. I would also like us to address the definition of what a work is. The ‘Television without Frontiers’ Directive indicates what it is not. It is not information. It is not advertising. Yet is it reality TV, for example? I would prefer – as would a number of professionals – an actual definition. I could also emphasise the role of public services. They must be able to carry out their remit. How can we help them to do this? I regret that my fellow MEPs have not followed my proposal for a European Public Audiovisual Service Charter. I would also like to invite the Commission to find the means to protect the diversity of television property and to prevent all excessive media concentration. Media pluralism is essential in democracy; since the Union keeps telling us that we cannot legislate in that area, it must at least help the Member States to lay down more stringent rules. On Tuesday 13 of next week, we are going to hold a seminar on this important issue, in Manchester. Since Mrs Reding is listening to us, I would like her to inform us of the developments envisaged by the Commission at this stage of the work, in particular on issues relating to advertising, to the field of application of the directive, to the support measures for the production of European and independent works and to the organisation of the regulation. What about adapting the country of origin principle and the principle of media pluralism?

 The negotiations currently underway at UNESCO are extremely important for us Europeans. We have so far managed to gain acceptance for our principles in international circles. My predecessors have restated those principles in this forum: cultural goods and services are not just commodities like any others. Cultural diversity is wealth for the whole of humanity. Every government should have the right to support cultural creativity and the dissemination of culture in its country without being subject to the sacrosanct requirements of free trade or to the authority of the WTO. We have succeeded in having these principles respected so far, and the cultural sector has been excluded from the international negotiations on the liberalisation of services at the World Trade Organisation. Those who believe that cultural goods and services are part of the entertainment industry are once again on the offensive, however. On their initiative, bilateral free trade agreements that include the cultural sector are multiplying. At UNESCO, the representatives of the United States and its allies are trying, to a great extent successfully, to weaken the text originally put forward for the convention. The only effective way of guaranteeing our right to cultural identity and cultural diversity is to make it a universal right recognised by all peoples and defended in the international institutions by their representatives. The UNESCO Convention must become the international legal instrument of reference on issues of cultural policy. It must not be subordinated to other commercial agreements. It must have an effective mechanism for dealing with differences of opinion. Finally, it must be ready in time for the next UNESCO general conference in October 2005, during which it can be adopted.

Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, the completion and proper operation of our internal market now require that we give economic operators the capacity to conduct their business across the Union. With this in mind, European companies need to be sure that if problems arise, they will have a legislative framework that will enable them to protect their interests. In the area of public contracts, they must have a guarantee that they will have effective recourse if they consider that their rights have been violated in the process of awarding these contracts. There are already a series of provisions in the national legal systems along these lines. However, the absence of coordinated rules relating to the deadlines for pre-contractual reviews has contributed to allowing a race to sign contracts to unfold, which prevents any objection from being raised against the procedures used once the contract has been signed. The desire to resolve this problem is the main objective of the text on which the European Parliament is now being asked to reach a decision in plenary, which is the result of a compromise reached with the European Commission and the Council. In this respect I would like to thank the shadow rapporteurs and the various political groups for their excellent cooperation, in a spirit of openness and dialogue. I would also, of course, like to thank the representatives of the Commission and of the Presidency-in-Office of the Council for their availability, expertise and desire to succeed, which made it possible to reach an agreement at first reading. The final text confirms the general focus of the reform around two main aims: firstly, to preserve the opportunity for candidates to seek a review by providing for the timely postponement of the contract; secondly, to establish a set of adequate penalties, which are essential for preventing violations. In order to achieve the first objective, Parliament, the Commission and the Council propose to establish a minimum standstill period of ten days, fifteen days in some cases, between the decision to award the contract and the signature of the contract, to allow candidates that consider their interests to have been damaged time to seek a review. In order to take into account the realities on the ground, this minimum period shall not apply to a series of situations, particularly in very urgent cases. The specific situations associated with framework agreements will also be exempted from this standstill period, subject to particularly exemplary penalties if irregularities are discovered. The second major focus of the draft reform concerns the penalties for violation of the rules. On this issue, the compromise reached with the Council and the Commission fully takes up the desire expressed by Parliament to have a set of penalties that are both severe and also adapted to the realities faced by local authorities. Therefore serious violations of the rules will result in the contract being considered ineffective, creating a deterrent for the awarding authorities. These cases include illegal direct awarding of contracts, which the Court of Justice has deemed to be the most serious violation of the rules applying to public contracts. Also affected are violations of the rules regarding framework agreements, and violations that damage tenderers’ chances of winning the contract. It will not, however, be compulsory for contracts to be considered ineffective in cases of minor breaches, for which the draft reform allows the possibility of applying other, less drastic penalties. It shall also be possible to be exempted from the rule of ineffectiveness of contracts if imperative public-interest reasons require that the contracts remain effective, subject, of course, to safeguards that Parliament wanted and secured. Based around these two objectives, the draft reform submitted to you for the vote is a balanced text that gained the support of representatives of Parliament and of the Commission and the Council. It was finalised under a tight schedule, and offers a series of guarantees that are necessary for economic operators that are candidates for public contracts, without placing excessive constraints on the awarding bodies. If it is adopted today it will enable Europe to take a new step along the path towards harmonising the rules governing its internal market. It will also help to give the Union effective tools to make the practices involved in awarding public contracts more ethical, by reducing the risks of fraud and corruption.

The Freitas report being put to the vote today concerns the outermost regions and, in particular, Réunion. The outermost regions suffer from geographical and geopolitical constraints that make them more isolated and less able to export their goods to the European continent. Designed as it is to compensate for additional costs, this scheme offers support to local fisheries sectors by processing fishery products and transporting them to, and marketing them on, the European continent. It also helps to increase the competitiveness of local companies and of the fisheries sector at European level. The effectiveness of this scheme can be illustrated by the fact that this compensation has enabled Réunion to increase the volume and value of its exports since 2000. Renewing this compensation scheme will enable us to continue our efforts to integrate the industrial, longline and coastal fishing sectors of the outermost regions into the internal market. These efforts must be supported by other factors such as the taking into account of the variation in oil prices, because it ought not to be forgotten that the outermost regions rely heavily on oil and that transport costs constrain the export of local goods.

Madam President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, I should like to begin by congratulating our rapporteur, Mr Arif, on the pertinence of his analyses. From an agricultural point of view, while the opening up of the markets is today offering real prospects of economic development on both shores of the Mediterranean, it is important that this trend be based on the experience of local populations and the actors on the ground. It is vital for the process to be implemented in a measured way, on a product by product basis and to a gradual timetable, in order to cater for small farms, which are the most fragile, the most numerous and the best equipped to develop a form of multifunctional agriculture that respects natural resources and local development. This regulatory work hinges on the strengthening of trade preferences on the basis of an asymmetric relationship designed to benefit the most vulnerable countries. It also hinges on support measures that will enable us to help these countries to modernise their production structures and that will contribute to the development of synergies, through technical and financial cooperation among professionals and by means of common labelling policies.

The text submitted to today’s vote puts an end to seven long years of work and heated debates between, on the one hand, supporters of the chemical industry, who have persisted in overusing arguments of competitiveness and employment in order to maintain the status quo, guaranteeing, as it does, their own financial interests, and, on the other hand, European officials, who were anxious to come up with responsible legislation aimed at protecting Europeans from the perils of the dangerous chemical substances found in staple goods. Of course, as is often the case, the outcome does not fully meet our demands. Proof of this is the number of goods covered by the REACH regulation – 
only 30 000 out of the 100 000 desired. Significant progress has been made, however, if we consider in particular the fact that only 3 000 substances are today being studied, and that it will be up to the chemical industry from now on to assume the burden of proof concerning the toxicity of substances, that is, to demonstrate that they are not harmful to humans. In the end, thanks to the pugnacity of the Socialist Group in the European Parliament’s rapporteur, Mr Sacconi, the European Union will have the world’s most binding legislation on this matter. That is why I emphatically endorsed the adoption of this text at second reading.

Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, the European Union is, today, about to reform the internal strand of the common market organisation (CMO) in the banana sector, in order to adapt the aid scheme for European producers to the new global trade situation and to the principles of the new common agricultural policy. This change, which is the subject of the report brought before the House today after being approved by a very large majority by Parliament’s Committee on Agriculture and Rural Development, undoubtedly goes in the right direction. For banana producers in the outermost regions, who account for more than 98% of the EU’s production, it is proposed to transfer a package of almost EUR 280 million a year to the POSEI programmes, which will make for greater flexibility and better use of Community funds. In this regard, I should like to thank you, Commissioner, for the reassessment of the amounts allotted for this reform, which should make it possible to better assure the sector’s viability, particularly in the outermost regions where banana production plays a vital economic and social role for which no other agricultural product could compensate. I must, however, remind you that the amounts proposed were calculated on the basis of the current customs tariff. Consequently, the uncertainty concerning world trade negotiations suggests that there may be a further reduction in this tariff level. Given that, at EUR 176 a tonne, the banana sector is already in an extremely delicate situation that threatens the socio-economic balance of many of the producing regions, a further reduction in the customs tariff would signal the end of banana production in the Community if no adjustment is made to the plan proposed by the Commission. If the opening up of markets is to make a contribution to revitalising the production structures, it can do so only insofar as the fundamental principles of regulation and equity are combined, that is, the various producers need to respect the common rules that put them on an equal commercial footing. It is, however, quite evident that this equality is totally lacking in global trade given the gulf that exists between the social and environmental standards of European countries and those of the countries of Central or Latin America. Faced with this problem, the resolution of which has to remain one of the European Union’s priorities, the aid granted to Community banana producers is necessary in order to compensate for the failures in the global trade system. To be effective, these internal regulatory measures must be in line with the external regulatory tools. It is in this light that the Committee on Agriculture and Rural Development is insisting on strengthening the evaluation measures indicated in the reform proposals, in order that the Commission could take positive steps if the external tariff situation were to deteriorate, for example by increasing the amount of the financial packages granted to producers. The survival of banana production in the European Union also depends on its capacity to optimise its production costs while respecting the social rules and living standards of the producers. Since the CMO was established, producers’ organisations have in this way enabled a better concentration of Community supply of bananas in the market and contributed to a noticeable reduction in the costs relating to the cultivation of bananas in the European Union. It would now be contradictory in economic terms to disrupt this process. That is why we believe it is essential to maintain a regulatory framework in this regard at Community level in relation to producers’ organisations, in order to further the efforts already made towards strengthening our production structures. As the Committee on Agriculture and Rural Development has asked, this willingness should, furthermore, be demonstrated by an obligation to affiliate to a producers’ organisation in order to benefit from aid provided within the context of the POSEI package, except when circumstances do not allow it. Finally, and this will be my last comment, there is the question of the administration of aid. The support system for production within the present CMO in bananas does provide for schemes for bi-monthly advances that are essential to the sector’s activity in the outermost regions as in the rest of the Union’s producing countries. The transfer of packages to the POSEI programmes, however, is not coupled with any plan to continue this system of advances. This jeopardises the survival of producers who would therefore have to resort to private sector borrowing, at a time when the characteristic fluctuations of the commercial climate in this sector does not encourage banks to grant long-term loans. In this context of economic instability it is up to the European public powers to provide adequate safeguards so that these trade policy choices at global level do not run counter to the interests of those producers who are the most fragile in the Union.

Despite the significant progress made in relation to the European Commission’s initial text, the text on services in the Union that has been proposed today at second reading does not offer guarantees that are sufficient to prevent any risk of the European social model falling apart. Certain sensitive social services, such as social housing, family support services and public health services, which were initially excluded from the scope of the future directive at first reading, have thus been reintegrated by the Member States. The legal vacuum accompanying, in particular, the abolition of the PPO has not been removed, leaving it to the arbitration of the Court of Justice judges – and not to the legislator – to define the future characteristics of European policy via the case-laws that this situation will most certainly generate. It is clear, in this context, that the Commission’s written statement, which is aimed at clarifying some of the gaps in the text, such as the exclusion of labour law, does not present any real legal value, and that makes its influence and usefulness particularly uncertain. For all these reasons, I voted to reject the proposal for a directive on services.

 At a time when the EU is facing an upsurge in nationalist sentiment, the Commission’s proposal to introduce a voluntary modulation of direct payments within the framework of the common agricultural policy signals a new stage in the disintegration of Community solidarity. Faced with this danger, Parliament had to respond and make its voice heard in order to reaffirm the commitment felt by the representatives of the European nations to defending the ‘common’ character of the EU’s public policies, of which the common agricultural policy is the most potent symbol and the most successful achievement. With this in mind, I voted in favour of the Goepel report, which was presented today in plenary, and, in particular, in favour of the explicit request outrightly to reject the European Commission’s proposal. This position, which expresses the opinion of the majority of Members present today, reflects Parliament’s clear and unambiguous desire not to betray its vision of the future Europe and not to make of the CAP an adjustment variable intended to compensate for the reprehensible weaknesses of a European budget crippled by the EU Member States’ lack of ambition. It signals the demand to retain a system of support for producers. Based on the principle of equity, this alone is capable of guaranteeing the future survival of viable and competitive European agriculture characterised by solidarity.

 The Weiler report that is being put to the vote today includes a number of positive points on the future of public-private partnerships, particularly as regards the Green Paper and Commission communication COM(2005)0569
. In this regard, I am delighted at the clear distinction made between public procurement and concessions, and at the call for a legislative initiative on the latter. Although I bitterly regret the fact that the European Parliament chose not to extend this approach with regard to institutional public-private partnerships, the amendments adopted in plenary represent an acknowledged step forward towards a future definition for 'in house' services, in other words towards a more secure situation for European local authorities. Although this interim text is not perfect, in my view it presents a set of advances that explain why I finally voted in favour, advances which the Commission now has responsibility for integrating fully into its future proposals on the subject.

 In Mr Schmidt's report, the European Parliament has tried to make a statement on the need to give fair trade a truly European political framework. This approach is absolutely vital, because the pressure currently exerted by the increasing openness of the world markets represents a serious threat to the economic, environmental and social viability of the various agricultural models across the world: by forcing farmers to sell their produce for lower and lower prices, it puts them at risk by undermining their income, and is partly responsible for the deteriorating working conditions of agricultural workers and the deterioration of the environment. Free trade can and must help to provide an alternative to this situation, which, by favouring the lowest common denominator, undermines the Millennium Development Goals. In this light, the Commission now needs to send a strong political signal in favour of a system of trade that provides producers with a decent income and helps to remove any temptations to social and environmental dumping. The growing popularity of free-trade products with European consumers is bound to act as an incentive for an initiative of this kind. Therefore, even though I find it regrettable that Parliament has not seen fit to advocate special tariff measures (a differentiated approach similar to GSP+) to benefit free-trade products, I will vote in favour of the Schmidt report.

 Although I regret the fact that, on 17 May 2006, the European Parliament validated the next Financial Perspective for 2007-2013, we now have to come to terms with the meagre sums that emerge from it if we are to define the role and determine the size of the Structural Funds for the next few years. With this in view, I am delighted with the clarity of the way in which European regional policy has now been constructed, focused as it is on three new objectives that are more coherent and more easily identifiable. I am also pleased that the significant reductions in the level of funds now available to the EU will not have disastrous consequences for the outermost regions whose specific handicaps, as well as their underdevelopment, make it crucial for them to receive the aid supplied by Community instruments designed to promote solidarity. In this way, the outermost regions will remain eligible for such aid in terms of the ‘Convergence, competitiveness and territorial cooperation’ objective (formerly Objective 1). The additional specific allocation of EUR 35 per inhabitant will also enable us in part to meet their needs. Finally, the objective of ‘European territorial cooperation’ will enable the outermost regions to extend the work already done on developing synergies with neighbouring states in the Indian Ocean and the Caribbean. For all these reasons, I have voted in favour of the report by Mr Hatzidakis.

 Over and above the political agreement on the Financial Perspective for 2007-2013, the negotiations that took place at the meetings of the Council on 15 and 16 December 2005 confirmed the need to change the own resources system. At a time when European integration appears to have stalled – due in particular to the tendency to take refuge in national self-interest and to the disjunction between the people and the Community institutions – the non-transparent nature of this bargaining and the fact that each Member State wishes to view the budgetary issue solely in terms of its own particular interests have highlighted the urgency of providing ourselves with a clear and unambiguous own resources system that, as far as possible, extricates the EU from current contingencies in relation to national budgets. It is vital that the European Parliament, as the representative of the nations, take part in this process. Mr Lamassoure’s report, which is being put to the vote today, is part and parcel of this process, and its conclusions – which tie up with a large proportion of the concerns expressed above – are along the right lines, designed as they are to bring about a Europe that is in control of its financial resources and closer to the people. Even though I should have liked the possibility already to have been mentioned of a European corporate tax as a new own resource for the EU, I have therefore voted in favour of this document.

I voted against the Sousa Pinto and Böge reports, which reflect the way in which Europe has taken a back seat to acts of national self-interest, destroy any far-reaching political project and seriously threaten existing public policies, not least the CAP and the Structural Funds, both of which are tools for showing solidarity with the most vulnerable regions.   As regards agriculture, there will thus be a shortfall of EUR 30 billion until 2013 to honour the CAP reform, the negotiators having failed to account for the fact that two new Member States will be joining the Union in 2009.  Having been presented as a way forward for the European agricultural sector, rural development is, for its part, showing a 21% decrease in the appropriations that were allocated to it in comparison with the previous period and is paving the way for the abuse of our rural territories.  The Union’s Cohesion Policy is undergoing the same drastic cuts, recording a 10% decrease in the Structural Funds and the Cohesion Fund, despite the fact that many European regions are lagging behind in terms of development, and thus instead required a substantial effort to be made regarding Community solidarity.   Directly affected, as they are, by this climb-down on the budget, the outermost regions will, moreover, be unable to rely on the development of new regional synergies, the European Neighbourhood and Partnership Instrument having lost an extra EUR 6 billion.

The aim of the text put to the vote was to allow the creation of a genuine internal market in services. At the same time, its aim was to rectify a draft directive, the philosophy of which, being based on competition between the social and fiscal laws of the Member States, would have tragic consequences via the levelling down of the various social models. While the first of these objectives was fulfilled, the same cannot be said for the second. Admittedly, Parliament helped substantially to modify the line of the initial text by deleting the country of origin principle, by excluding SGIs from the scope of the directive and by protecting labour law. The fact remains that there are still a large number of grey areas. Social services and the economic component of public services (SGEIs) are still under the direct threat of unacceptable social dumping. The legal vacuum associated with the deletion of the COP presages, furthermore, a new situation, in which it is the judges of the European Court of Justice who will have the power to lay down social laws, with no guarantee of the outcome or democratic control. Although I welcome the progress made on this matter, I am quite unable, for these extremely important reasons, to support the final text submitted to Parliament.

 Mr President, I fully agree with what the representative of the Group of the European People’s Party (Christian Democrats) and European Democrats has just said: that was one of the things the Committee on Agriculture and Rural Development was calling for.

 Madam President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, the European Union is today faced with the necessity of reforming its sugar sector. As we all know, this reform is unavoidable. It is necessary because we need to bring the common organisation of the market in sugar into line with the guiding principles of the new common agricultural policy. It is also necessary in order to adapt to the changing rules of world trade. All the same, we must not lose sight of the consequences of the coming changes for the men and women who make their living from producing sugar in the fields and factories of the Community and in the developing countries. With this in mind, it is important that the changes to the European sugar sector do not result in the dismantling of our common organisation of the market in sugar, in the gradual closure of our production capacity or in the sacrifice of our producers and those of the poorest countries in consequence of an uncontrolled opening of world trade. Reform is essential, that is true, but it will only meet its objectives if the quest for efficiency respects the requirements of social justice. This twin perspective, which makes for balance, is the common thread running through the three reports on which the European Parliament is to vote this week and which were adopted almost unanimously by the Committee on Agriculture and Rural Development on 29 November last. These texts are the fruit of several months’ discussions and hearings in the Committee on Agriculture and of exchanges of views with yourself, Commissioner, with your services and with the various parties concerned in the industry. They represent a compromise negotiated and approved by a large majority of the political groups in this Parliament. There are four major aspects to this compromise. The first is the introduction of flexible regulation of the sugar market. Flexibility, then, through the gradual introduction of market logic into the sector; I am referring to the reference price, which will make the sector more competitive. Regulation, too, however, to avoid the disastrous consequences of a totally deregulated sugar market. Internally, this means maintaining the intervention system for a time so as to guarantee market stability during the next four years, which we all know will be difficult economically. Turning to the external aspect of the reform, the need for regulation means keeping control of sugar imports from the least developed countries. It is in fact essential today that we take account of the damage caused by the uncontrolled opening of trade, as the recent example of the western Balkans has shown. With this in mind, in order to avoid any incentive for fraud once the ‘Everything But Arms’ initiative has taken full effect, the Committee on Agriculture argues in particular for the establishment of a commercial safeguard in the form of a safeguard clause limiting exports according to the net exporter principle. This arrangement would enable us to prevent destructive triangular trade while ensuring for the least developed countries that their local populations working in the sugar-producing sector will actually benefit from the preferential trade regime with the European Union. It would not affect the growth prospects of the LDCs’ sugar industries and would be fully compatible with the objectives of the ‘Everything But Arms’ initiative. The second major theme of the compromise before Parliament is European solidarity with, in particular, the most fragile regions. While the establishment of trade regulation will allow us to stabilise markets and avoid excessive price fluctuations in the future, it must in fact be accompanied by measures to cushion the reform’s impact on the communities most affected by cessation of activity, above all those which are most fragile. These include, first of all, farmers; they must receive substantial compensation for their loss of income, and some of the aid provided by the restructuring scheme should allow those who will lose their delivery rights and will be forced to make new investments in order to switch to other crops to be indemnified. Then there are the people employed in sugar factories. They are totally dependant on the sector’s future restructuring, and it is essential, where there is cessation of industrial activity, that they be considered by strengthening the conditions that manufacturers will have to satisfy in order to receive aid from the restructuring fund. Finally, to avoid the most fragile regions being the main casualties of the restructuring of Community production, it is essential that the Member States should still have the final say over whether production ceases or continues on their territory. It is also essential that due and proper account be taken of the specific situations and constraints of the outermost regions. The growing and processing of sugar cane are essential to those regions and irreplaceable, in economic, social and cultural terms. In this connection, Commissioner, I would like to thank you for being such a good listener and for the efforts you have made to ensure that these regions receive special treatment, especially as regards compensation and sales aid. I am sure that such schemes, for which Parliament has called, will enable the people of those regions who make their living from sugar cane to look to the future with greater equanimity. The third aspect of the reform is concerned with the sector’s future through the development of alternative outlets. In a world context characterised, on the one hand, by rising oil prices and, on the other, by the need to fight greenhouse gases, alcohol production in the sugar sector in fact offers a major asset for the development of alternative energies. In view of the impact of the reform of the COM on production levels, the Committee on Agriculture and Rural Development therefore proposes anticipating these trends by means of a proactive policy involving both the agricultural and the industrial aspects: the agricultural by means of measures to improve access to aid for energy crops in particular, the industrial by adapting the restructuring scheme to encourage the development of bioethanol distilleries. These tools form part of a coherent legislative proposal that would encourage the development of the bioethanol industry, a source of outlets for both farmers and manufacturers in the sector. Finally, the fourth and last major thrust of our work, but not the least: prices. By contrast to the Commission’s original proposals, which would have a drastic effect on the sector, the rural fabric and the developing countries, the Committee on Agriculture in the end came out in favour of a slower and more moderate 30% reduction in sugar prices over four years. Such a level of price reduction would guarantee the reform’s economic effectiveness while helping to soften its impact on the sector’s players. In so doing, it would better guarantee continued activity in the production regions, safeguarding hundreds of thousands of jobs directly and indirectly related to the sector. This more moderate approach is also in line with the Community’s development commitments and will enable the ACP and LDC countries which export part of their production to the EU to continue to practice remunerative prices. At the end of November, in anticipation of the World Trade Organisation conference in Hong Kong and without waiting for Parliament’s final vote, the Ministers of Agriculture of the twenty-five Member States reached an informal, provisional compromise on the main directions of the future reform. While the real purpose of that agreement was to arrive at a common political line, the way it was immediately exploited by the various signatories in the media as meaning that the reform had been settled ahead of schedule nevertheless sends a clear message: I believe it expresses the desire of the Commission and the Council to bypass the European Parliament, whose prior opinion is nevertheless mandatory before any decision is taken. In this respect, I find the procedure totally unacceptable and it must be condemned in the strongest terms. However that may be, that compromise is now on the table and while it does not follow the Committee on Agriculture’s proposed amendments to the letter, it has to be said that, as it stands, it is a remarkable confirmation of how far the Council has moved from the original proposals. The compromise marks an appreciable shift towards the more moderate and more balanced measures proposed by the Committee on Agriculture and Rural Development on the four major topics I have just mentioned. In terms of regulation, it takes up the idea of maintaining the intervention system for four years, before moving to a reference price, which will mark the introduction of the logic of the market into the common organisation of the market in sugar. Secondly, and more importantly, it confirms the soundness of Parliament’s analysis regarding the need to retain some ability to manage the supply of sugar on the Community market. While the measures proposed are different, their philosophies converge along the lines of adapting the ‘Everything But Arms’ initiative. Concerning the implementation of European solidarity, the Council backs the increase in aid to farmers, proposing a compensation of 64.2% of lost earnings instead of the 60% initially proposed. It also takes up the idea of transferring to farmers 10% of the money provided for restructuring aid. Parliament’s proposal for a partial coupling and a modulation of aid for the less-favoured regions was not adopted, however. Concerning the third line of approach, alternative outlets, the Ministers of Agriculture of the twenty-five Member States confirmed the possibility of a partial dismantling of factories, enabling bioethanol distilleries to be developed. Nevertheless, the hoped-for financial incentives for the development of energy crops have not materialised. Finally, in the field of prices, the 36% reduction over four years envisaged by the Council is not so quick or drastic as the initial proposals and is entirely consistent with the work done by the European Parliament’s Committee on Agriculture. Despite this undeniable progress, which must be welcomed, a number of proposals have not been taken up, in particular as regards tightening up the conditions that manufacturers will have to satisfy in order to qualify for restructuring aid. It is in this regard particularly regrettable that the Council has up until now disregarded all the social criteria that must be complied with and the fact that it is ultimately up to the Member States to approve or otherwise any cessations of production. Moreover, even if it means departing from what is, strictly speaking, the subject of this debate and of my reports, I really must at this point express my outrage at the way the ACP countries are treated. In the light of a reform, and in particular a price cut, the consequences of which will be disastrous for a great many of them, the sum of EUR 40 million allocated by the Council for 2006 can only be considered derisory and insulting. The European Union really will have to find the resources necessary to remedy this situation, which contrasts with what the Heads of State or Government have repeatedly said about helping the poorest countries to develop. It is clear, ladies and gentlemen, that the Ministers of Agriculture will have to continue their efforts during the February negotiations if they are to reach a final agreement that is acceptable to all. With this in mind, I would like Parliament to vote in favour of the three reports before it with the largest possible majority in order to send a strong signal to the members of the Council so that the remaining gaps in November’s provisional compromise are closed and the COM in sugar is reformed in a way that is both fair and efficient.

Mr Böge’s report represents Parliament’s mandate for negotiation with a view to the next financial perspective for 2007-2013. I voted against this report for the following reasons. 1.	The process of ratification of the Constitutional Treaty showed that some of the nations of Europe had doubts about the effectiveness of European socio-economic policies. I am convinced that the European Union has to have an ambitious budget that gives to the Community’s authorities the means of carrying out their task. The Böge report, which fixes the payment appropriations at 1.7% of the Gross National Income, does not measure up to this challenge. 2.	The emphasis on budgetary restraint undermines the European commitment towards farmers. It also threatens the viability of the common market organisation (CMO) for sugar, the reform of which it will not be possible to finance. I do not accept that farmers should become the victims of national self-interest, implicit in the Böge report. 3.	The introduction of joint financing, which opens the way to renationalisation of the common agricultural policy (CAP), is, in my opinion, unacceptable. It signals a departure from the only public policy that is genuinely European, at a moment in our history when Europe needs to become stronger by sharing its strengths. Giving in to national misgivings would further widen the gap between Europe and its nations.

 Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, on 21 February the Committee on Agriculture and Rural Development, by 31 votes out of 35, adopted a common position on the reform of the common organisation of the markets in sugar. This large majority demonstrates the degree of equilibrium which we achieved and which takes into account the opinions of most of the political groups and nationalities represented in this House. The subject is a complex one. On the one hand, bearing in mind the international economic context, the reform of the common organisation of the markets in sugar is now necessary and unavoidable. On the other hand, however, it must not neglect the position and the future of the men and women who depend on this sector, both in Europe and in the countries that are our trading partners. From this point of view, the draft resolution lays down clear guiding principles: adjusting the sugar COM in line with the rules of world trade, increasing the competitiveness of the sugar sector, guaranteeing a decent standard of living for those engaged in the sector – a social objective – either by enabling them to keep their jobs or, if necessary, retraining them, and at the same time complying with the principle of Community solidarity which takes account of the most vulnerable regions and States within the Union and also our historical trading partners, the ACP countries and the least-developed countries. In order to respond to these demands, we need to define four principal themes which will guide the future reform of this sector. First of all, as far as the timetable is concerned, the forthcoming reform must remain effective until the end of 2012, so that those engaged in the sector can have the long-term outlook which they need if their investments are to succeed. Secondly, the lowering of prices and quotas must be limited to what is strictly necessary in order to take into account the interests of European farmers. It must also be backed up by a level of compensation which really corresponds to what is needed. Finally, as a replacement for the quota transfer mechanism, which is unfair and destructive for the most vulnerable countries, the resolution proposes the setting up of a special fund, managed by Europe and budget-neutral, which will make it possible to organise the restructuring of the sector. Fourthly, the members of the Committee on Agriculture and Rural Development have at last come out strongly in favour of a system of market regulation which makes use, in particular, of an adaptation of the ‘Everything but Arms’ initiative in the sugar sector. This major theme is aimed at maintaining the consistency and viability of the COM by requiring the European Union to be in a position to retain control of the supply of sugar on its market, while at the same time responding to repeated requests by the least-developed countries themselves, who are well aware that the illegal triangular trade which may be encouraged by unlimited access to the European market will not provide any profit for the development of the economic and social structures in the least-developed countries. Finally, together with these four main themes, the draft resolution emphasises the need to take into consideration the special situation of the extremely remote areas of the Union, looking at their geographical and structural constraints as well as their specific economic and productive development needs. Emphasising the important and irreplaceable role which the growing of sugar cane plays in some of those regions, the report comes down heavily in favour of total compensation for any loss of revenue which overseas farmers might suffer and demands, equally firmly, that the essential mechanism of marketing aid should be retained. Ladies and gentlemen, in view of the current blockages to which the Commission’s radical measures have given rise within the Council of Ministers, only the European Parliament is currently in a position to act as the driving force in defining the detailed rules for the implementation of the sugar COM. This is the ambition of our report, which adopts a position which I regard as balanced, consistent and proactive, and tending towards a reform which will be effective but also based on solidarity.

Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I would also like to congratulate the rapporteur on his excellent work, which, as our colleague Mr Arif said, aims towards simplification and greater effectiveness of the generalised system of preferences. More importantly, however, I wish to thank Mr Sánchez Presedo for considering the impact of the ‘Everything But Arms’ initiative, particularly in the area of sugar, especially in the light of the forthcoming reform of our common organisation of the market. The recent example of the Balkans showed that limited access to the European market sometimes has the disadvantage of contributing to the development of an illegal triangular trade, which in the case of the fifty less advanced countries would probably generate a massive influx of sugar into the European market. Therefore, as the reform of the COM means that European countries will now experience fluctuations and will therefore be subject to the vagaries of the market, a significant increase in the supply of sugar will result in a huge drop in prices in the Union, at the same time removing the economic value of the ‘Everything But Arms’ initiative for the least advanced countries. This is why, following the repeated requests from the least advanced countries themselves and in line with the recommendations of the Committee on Agriculture, this report on the generalised system of preferences leaves open the possibility of adapting the ‘Everything But Arms’ initiative by allowing, if necessary, an extension of the transitional period preceding the complete opening up of the market. This significant step forward due to the clear-sightedness of the rapporteur is necessary for the economic survival of the least advanced countries. It will give them time, in accordance with the reform of the COM in sugar, to modernise their production structures in order to adapt to the new European order. This is why it is imperative that the European Parliament adopts this text in order to take into account the specific nature of some sectors and so that the generalised system of preferences really fulfils its prime objective, which is the development of the countries that are most in need.

 The Corbett report, upon which the European Parliament gave its verdict today, acknowledges the indisputable progress made by the Treaty establishing a Constitution for Europe. The Treaty provides us with a number of tools that are essential if we wish to make Europe more efficient, easier to understand and more democratic. It does so by clarifying the roles of the institutions, reducing the scope for blocking decisions and increasing the powers of the European Parliament and of its representatives, who have been elected by popular vote. At the same time, it fosters Community solidarity and helps ensure genuine cohesion within the EU. Firstly, it helps ensure social cohesion thanks to the Charter of Fundamental Rights, which lays down rules relating to civic, political and social rights. The Treaty also declares Europe’s objectives to be a social market economy, sustainable development and the fight against discrimination. Secondly, it helps ensure territorial cohesion by means of a set of provisions that will help the EU’s regions to manage their own development. The Treaty reiterates the specific nature of the UPRs, and more particularly that of the French overseas territories. By consolidating the mechanisms under which derogations may be granted from Community rules, it provides real protection for the overseas territories, thus counteracting a destructive mindset that regards Europe as a uniform and homogenous territory.

 The first round of hearings of Commissioners-designate held by Parliament made it clear to Members of this House that some of these Commissioners-designate had an extremely poor grasp of matters falling under the portfolios for which they might have been responsible. What is more, following the example set by Mr Buttiglione in his statements, positions were revealed during these hearings which were ideologically outrageous and which violated the EU’s basic values, such as tolerance, cultural pluralism and freedom of thought. The line-up of the new Commission, upon whose investiture Parliament was asked to vote today, admittedly takes these problems into account. Yet it does not provide any kind of response to the political issues and to some of the ethical issues which aroused the opposition of a majority of Members of this House on 27 October. The replacement of Mr Buttiglione by Mr Frattini means that the post of Commissioner for freedom, security and justice is held by a man known for having drafted Italian laws intended to shield Mr Berlusconi from accusations against him, most notably those relating to corruption. Moreover, the portfolio for competition continues to be held by Mrs Kroes, whose links with the world of business mean that there is a real risk that conflicts of interest will occur.

Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, I believe that Commissioner Špidla was right to suggest that we on the Committee on Employment and Social Affairs should review this European Globalisation Adjustment Fund (EGF), which came into being on 1 January 2007. Parliament should adopt this proposal unamended as it aims to extend the scope of the EGF to situations of economic and financial crisis. Our committee chairman, Jan Andersson, was right to propose a text adopted by a large majority on the Committee on Employment in order to convey to all the committees, particularly the Committee on Budgets, that it was important to communicate with the Member States, so that every employee, every member of a trade union, and every member of the public can be informed in their own language of the existence of this European Fund. Thanks to this trialogue, and because a large majority on the Committee on Employment rejected all the amendments, we can be proud of ourselves due to: cofinancing of 65% by the EU and 35% by the Member States; the number of redundancies required to benefit from the European Fund reduced to 500 workers; redundancies counted from the announcement of the company’s redundancy programme; intervention by the European Fund due to the consequences of the economic crisis; exceptional arrangements more favourable to the application of the Fund, which will continue until the end of 2011; and finally a period of 24 months for implementation of the EGF. Our committee was right, but we must go further. I would ask all the Member States to do everything in their power to ensure that all workers who find themselves in difficulty can benefit from these provisions as quickly as possible. I would ask Commissioner Špidla if this amendment can apply from 1 May 2009, provided that tomorrow we have the large majority needed to adopt this proposal at first reading. Let us crown our legislative term with the adoption of this amendment to the European Fund, which will allow us to help our struggling workers. What does a redundant worker want? He wants to know what his life will be like at the end of the month. He wants to know what he will do with his life tomorrow. He wants to know if he can utilise the knowledge that he acquired while he was in work. Think about the fact that he might need further training in order to advance into the future. At the end of this legislative term, I therefore address all those who are members of the Committee on Employment, whatever side they sit on: please make sure that this text can be applied immediately.

Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, I would first like to thank the various shadow rapporteurs for their open-minded work during our collaboration on this text in the Committee on Employment and Social Affairs. The Member States must improve the implementation of the directive on informing and consulting employees, particularly in the current context of the financial crisis and of its consequences for companies as they restructure, merge or move abroad. This is the message the Committee on Employment was seeking to send out in this initiative report. The European Union has 23 million companies with fewer than 250 employees. They represent 99% of companies and employ over 100 million people. Workers’ rights to information and consultation are essential components of the social market economy. The transposition of Directive 2002/14/EC has been considerably delayed in some Member States. In this own-initiative report, we point out that the impact of this directive is evident in the countries where no general system of worker information and consultation existed. I am calling for an improved transposition of the directive in the Member States. We ask that the Commission takes measures, as soon as possible, to ensure the proper transposition of this directive by the Member States, and to bring infringement proceedings against those that have either not transposed it at all or have done so incorrectly. The report also emphasises that, in their transposition measures, some Member States have not included some young workers, women working part-time or workers employed for a short period on temporary contracts. We ask that the Member States define precisely the term ‘information’ by allowing workers’ representatives to examine the data supplied and not to content themselves with awaiting the end of the information procedure if the companies’ decisions have direct consequences for the workers. Member States without effective, proportionate and deterrent sanctions are asked to introduce them. Finally, in an improved coordination of the different legislative instruments, we also invite the Commission to examine what is required to coordinate the six directives and the regulation on informing employees, so that any amendments to get rid of overlaps and contradictions can be made. As this type of advance in workers’ rights is more than beneficial, the Union owes it to itself to guarantee that the Member States transpose the obligations of the directive correctly and in full. It is essential that all European workers know that Europe supports them in their involvement in the life of their company, in their daily lives as workers, and especially at the present time.

 Today’s vote in the European Parliament is vitally important. The maximum working time in Europe will remain at 48 hours, which will allow countries that have a regime that is more favourable to workers not to change anything (such as France, which has 35 hours). The Council wanted to increase this limit to 65 hours. The forces of the left and those who defend workers, such as the European Trade Union Confederation, can be proud of this victory. Doctors and medical students must not be forgotten, since this victory is also for them. On-call time for medical staff will continue to be counted as working time. This vote, having received a large majority, will allow 27 MEPs to assert their position loud and clear to the 27 Ministers in the Conciliation Committee.

Mr President, Madam President-in-Office of the Council, Commissioner, firstly I should like to congratulate Mr Bushill-Matthews, who gave us a great lesson in democracy as the bearer of the Committee on Employment and Social Affairs’ message during the trialogue. Today, the trialogue has taken place. The partners have tried to reach an agreement. I should also like to congratulate you, Commissioner, because, at a given moment, you managed to ensure that Parliament’s role as colegislator was somewhat denied us, since, through an agreement reached by the social partners, you made us see that only the points raised by them could be debated by us. The important thing now is to make a success of this trialogue. It has taken place, and we are now in a position to ensure that this text is adopted at first reading. However, this must not mean that a review is ruled out, and this must not mean that we are prevented from subsequently thinking about how we can achieve a full review, with the support of all, or nearly all, of the social partners. I believe that it is in this spirit that we must act. Of course, tomorrow, at first reading, we have to win our case, but it is obvious, too, that we need to look at how all this is applied and how we will be able to ensure that a review can take place.

Madam President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, I am one of those who thinks that posting of workers is an opportunity for the European Union and its citizens. An opportunity both in economic terms and in terms of contributing to strengthening the European idea. Workers who are posted on European territory are first of all Europeans and they must be treated as such, which, to my mind, means that for the same job in the same territory, no inequality should be allowed. One of the problems raised today by the Directive 96/71/EC is that, on account of the lack of harmonisation of national systems in relation to labour law and the disparities existing between new and old Member States in this field, a fear arises that this directive will allow arbitration between Member States and be linked with ‘social dumping’. I repeat once more: it is from the top that social Europe must be built, and not by smashing to bits its social acquis
, as some here would like. I cite as evidence certain amendments tabled on this report in relation to modernising labour law. In this field, I advise them not to play at alchemy, at the risk of finding themselves confronted with uncontrollable social conflicts. To my mind, in order to avoid these pitfalls, Member States must be able to continue to retain some restrictions but also, when they receive workers on secondment, they must be able to impose certain conditions. I think in particular that workers on secondment must have authorised representatives who must be independent. They must be able to supply relevant information regarding working hours and health and safety in relation to this work, so that they can be guaranteed protection. Employees on secondment must make a prior declaration, so that the social partners in the host countries, where wages are fixed by collective bargaining, can come into play to negotiate directly with the home company of the seconded workers. We must, however, go further still in this field by giving further thought, for example, to establishing a minimum European wage. We must have a political commitment to convergence towards a floor of social rights common to all the European Union. It is with such practices that we put ourselves on the road towards a social Europe, a united Europe, a Europe of workers that we all wish for.

 Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, I should like, first of all, to thank our colleague, Mr Hasse Ferreira, for the work that he has done. Dealing with social services of general interest (SSGIs) is not an easy matter, but he has demonstrated his listening skills throughout our meetings. The key point in our colleague’s report is the launch of a consultation of the parties concerned, the aim of which is to better cater for the characteristics of SSGIs in the application of Community law. Social services are characterised, among other things, by the fact that they are personalised, that they implement basic social rights and that they help increase social cohesion, by protecting the most vulnerable. As such, they are an integral part of the European social model because, in their current form, they are specific to Europe and they contribute to the European growth strategy. They represent a dynamic economic sector and they create jobs, while being distinct from the other services of general economic interest. The services are operated on the basis of the solidarity principle and of their proximity to users. The problem today with the great majority of SSGIs is that they fall directly within the scope of the Community Treaties; in other words, they are subject to the rules of the internal market and of competition. The issue of the application of these rules therefore arises in view of the need for the public authorities to continue intervening regarding arrangements for providing services. This objective to regularise public services fulfils legitimate objectives to do with maintaining the quality of services and making them accessible in urban and rural areas, and with protecting the users and vulnerable people who benefit from them. Our social model, which we want to promote as an alternative to ultraliberalism, must not fall victim to our own Community rules.

Mr President, Mr Špidla, Mrs Bachelot-Narquin, ladies and gentlemen, I should like to begin by congratulating our rapporteur, Mrs Bachelot-Narquin, not because it is customary to do so, but because she has been able to put her stamp on this report. During our work, she has been able to establish a constructive frame of mind with all of the draftsmen and the groups, which now enables us to examine a report at first reading, something that we could not have hoped for only a short time ago. Yes, ladies and gentlemen, to the great displeasure of those who think that Europe is nothing but a large market with no political objective, the European Globalisation Adjustment Fund is going to come into being. It is true that the delivery has been painful and that, sadly, the case of the Volkswagen-Forest employees, about whom I cannot help but think this evening, has hung in the balance. It has enabled the detractors of the project to realise how useful and, moreover, necessary, this Fund is. It is quite clear that the Socialist Group in the European Parliament was unwilling to accept just any compromise when it came to reaching this agreement at first reading, but we are genuinely satisfied with the results of the trialogue. We particularly welcome the integration of the Fund regulation; the assurances that we have obtained thanks to the tenacity of the members of the Committee on Budgets; the implementation of the safeguard clauses, which will enable us to support employees who have been made redundant; the creation of a European one-stop shop, which will guarantee everyone equal access to information; the certification of acquired experience, which recognises employees who find themselves out of a job after years of work; the funding of cooperative projects and the obtaining of micro-credits; and the maintaining of Article 10, which sets a rate of 50% for the European Globalisation Adjustment Fund’s contribution to the funding of issues, which makes this tool an entirely European fund. An agreement is never perfect, of course; it is the fruit of compromise. The Socialists regret, for example, that, as regards the resources allocated to this Fund today, the European budget does not exceed EUR 115.5 billion. It is a pity that we did not see more money go into this budget. Thanks to this agreement at first reading, this Fund will be operational as from 1 January. It gives rise to a hope, that of seeing work finally begin on a social Europe. It is important to understand that job insecurity and the pitting of European workers against each other is not the norm. It is up to Europe to guarantee employee protection. Social Europe is the only Europe that can now bring the citizens closer to their institutions. This Fund represents the first stage towards a more united Europe. Today, Europeans expect Europe to contribute to their job security and their lifestyles, in the same way that it has been able to guarantee peace and stability for almost 50 years.

Mr President, the European social model, the Lisbon Strategy, a Social Europe: what meaning is left in these words, which are nothing but empty promises in the reddened eyes of Volkswagen employees and their families? Precarious existences have become the norm, and pitting employees against each other has become a managerial strategy, like redundancies and unemployment. An ever-growing number of workers accept life on the brink of the abyss because they have no alternative. Europe was built on foundations of peace, but social strife is being fomented, with tragic consequences in terms of human distress, growing distrust of the European Union and an upsurge in support for extremist parties in every election. Are we to allow 4 000 jobs to be axed with impunity on the doorstep of our institutions, and more than 10 000 people to be put out of work, by a group that has simultaneously been announcing plans to set up a plant in India? European funds will have to be mobilised, including the new Globalisation Adjustment Fund. We shall see to that, perhaps by tabling a Volkswagen amendment – why not? It is high time workers were respected in Europe, in the European Parliament and on our doorstep.

 Mr President, the Socialist Group in the European Parliament requests that the debate and the vote on Mrs Bachelot’s report on the European Globalisation Adjustment Fund be postponed. In fact, because COREPER and the Finnish Presidency only finalised their version of the regulation on Friday 10 November, the document did not reach us until the end of the afternoon. As a result, although we worked with the rapporteur all last week in informal meetings with the Council and the Commission, we were not able to have an initial discussion amongst ourselves between Friday evening and today. We therefore ask that both the debate and the votes be postponed to the second November session in order to enable us to carry out our examination of the proposals made to us by the Council.

Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I am tempted to go back over Mr Harbour’s remarks. While he has experienced redundancies and restructuring, I myself have been made redundant three times due to economic developments and restructuring in the Nord Pas-de-Calais, in France. The Socialist Group in the European Parliament is in favour of a policy enabling businesses to create jobs, to modernise and to promote economic development. Yet, when it talks about economic development, the PSE Group is also talking about social support, with a view to creating wealth, but to redistributing it too. Europe must demonstrate its European social model. That is the reason why we have worked collectively and why more than 80% of us voted in favour of a report on restructuring and employment, in which we state that we certainly need to provide for a form of support, but that we also need to enlighten Europe about what we are and about what we do. We voted in favour, by a very large majority, in an effort to say that, if Europe provides economic aid and public money and if it becomes clear at any given time that a form of ‘subsidised tourism' exists, then that money must be reimbursed. General Motors, where last year more than 500 000 employees were affected by restructuring, is one such example that is of concern to us today. We are not complaining, but we do believe that everyone must be respected, and employees in particular. Restructuring is necessary in order to keep our businesses economically competitive. It still has many consequences for all that. In the case of General Motors today, as in many cases of restructuring, Europeans are awaiting a strong response from the Union. Mr Barroso gave us this response by calling on the new Finnish Presidency to embody the Europe of results. Well, the Europe of results starts here, in this Chamber, with a strong signal sent out to the employees who are currently in difficulties. Support measures must of course be taken, concerning training and aid, but we must ask ourselves as from today how the public money that has been distributed will be paid back. (Applause)

 Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, the report by Mr Őry, whom I would like at this point to congratulate on his work, could turn out to be a real boon for European workers. The restrictions on the free movement of workers have some harmful effects, including the expansion of illegal work. Just in the last few months, Polish workers have been discovered in France, living in hovels, malnourished, unpaid and with no care – they had been brought to the country by a German sub-contracting company. Ironically, these workers were involved in building a law court. Where is the justice in that? Such cases are quite unacceptable. The free movement of workers must form one of the factors for promoting social progress, one of the tools for creating a barrier to social dumping. The end of the transitional arrangements will force employers to provide their employees with decent living conditions in accordance with social legislation in the host country. Social protection, decent housing, a decent salary, fair working hours – those are the basic rights that this freedom of movement should provide, and we will ensure that it does so. We cannot accept a situation where some employers exploit the different nationalities of their employees to reduce their operating costs, in the same way as others play the stock market. Let us remember that the founding European project aims to unite populations, not to divide them. If we continue to restrict the free movement of workers, we will only feed the fears of citizens in certain Member States, who are terrified at the idea of being treated as second-class European citizens. And you are right, Commissioner, we now need to talk in terms of European citizens. These restrictions must be fully lifted. It can be done, but the checks need to be strengthened so that the first beneficiaries of this measure do not become its first victims.

I voted in favour of the motion for a resolution on restructuring and employment, which proposes financial resources, an enhanced role for the social partners and tools for analysing and anticipating restructuring. Businesses are restructured for various reasons, sometimes for the purpose of defending them and sometimes in order to make them more combative, but the process always has the same effects on employees, who are the adjustment variable where the strategies of industrial groups are concerned. It is commendable and necessary that the European Union should be looking into this problem with the aim of anticipating the consequences of restructuring for employees, but it is the EU’s duty to establish an economic and industrial policy that is dynamic and concerned with preserving and creating jobs for Europeans, as well as social and territorial cohesion. I regret, therefore, that the EU itself encourages competition among the Member States by allowing social and fiscal dumping to prevail.

Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, first of all I would like to thank my fellow Members for entrusting me with this report. One of the methods I used in preparing this report was to listen. I met all of the social partners, employees and employers, I went to meet the Economic and Social Committee and the Committee of the Regions and I had a meeting with Commissioner Špidla and the Commission's partners. We also carried out a great deal of consultation with the shadow rapporteurs and I would like to take this opportunity to thank Mrs Bachelot, Mrs McDonald, Mrs Schroedter and Mr Beaupuy for their willingness to compromise and for the quality of their work. When we talk about restructuring, there is always a certain impression that people are surprised, and that it is a new phenomenon. In fact, it is as old as the hills and completely unavoidable. Society changes, moves on, modernises. It is quite normal for its economic activity to follow the same evolutionary curve. The technical progress made by humans has been resulting in restructuring for centuries. I will give you an example that I am sure will not offend anybody here: in the transition from hunting and gathering to agriculture, our ancestors experienced a great deal of restructuring. Having said that, it is true that the acceleration of progress and today's global market have given these phenomena a new face. Each new decision we take may result in restructuring. That is why I would like, if I may, to congratulate the Commission on having recognised, in its communication, that, since the EU is sometimes the cause for restructuring, such as in the textiles sector, it needs to bear its share of the responsibility by supporting it to the best of its ability. As you will have noticed, I have attempted throughout my report to stress the fact that restructuring is necessary, because in my view it ensures that our businesses remain economically competitive and thus safeguards jobs. However, in examining this issue, we cannot ignore restructuring based on false pretexts, which is in fact predicated on the hunt for an immediate profit. It is quite justifiable to condemn such behaviour as immoral, because it is absolutely unacceptable in today's Europe for a father with a family to support to find the factory gates locked on Monday morning, everything having been cleared out over the weekend. The role of our institutions, and of the social partners, is to intervene as early as possible, so as to plan for restructuring better and to soften the blow in terms of the social cost. This is because restructuring, whether or not it is justified, often leaves people by the wayside. Restructuring is not a phenomenon that affects any Member State in particular. We must not heed the siren's call that tries to set us in opposition to each other whenever we discuss employment in this Chamber. There are not two blocks with the old Member States on one side and the new ones on the other. No, there are 450 million Europeans from Tallinn to Lisbon, any of whom could suddenly find themselves in this situation. In my report, I have tried to define three spheres of action. First of all, there is a sphere of action to support what we might call good corporate citizens, by strengthening the tools for analysing the phenomenon, in order to prevent it in advance, increasing aid to small and medium-sized enterprises, encouraging continuing vocational training, which is a right for employees and an undeniable asset for businesses, reforming State aid to support growth and, in particular, setting up a globalisation adjustment fund. Secondly, there is a sphere of action to punish the 'gangster' companies, if I may call them that – they are certainly very much in the minority, but they are the ones we talk about the most. This type of action involves better monitoring of the use of the European funds in order to prevent subsidy tourism, challenging certain instances of restructuring with doubtful motives, and respecting the Community legal acquis 
and its enforcement. Thirdly, there is a sphere of action to support those primarily affected by the phenomenon of restructuring: the workers. This involves setting up permanent retraining units to help people to find new positions as soon as possible after losing their jobs. It involves strengthening the role of the social partners, who are our greatest asset in dealing with these phenomena, and that is why I would ask you all once again to consider reviewing the European Works Councils directive. It also involves encouraging employees to become shareholders in their companies and setting up a one-stop shop to give all EU citizens equal access to care. To conclude, I think that, alongside the social partners and beyond any party political affiliations, we can help to provide support for restructuring in order to win the employment battle. We need to bear this in mind at a time when, from one minute to the next, it is possible for a decision taken by a board of directors on the other side of the world to completely destroy, here on our territory, the fruit of decades of work. This matter gives us the opportunity to get involved in the lives of our citizens, because that is what this is all about, behind all of our technical circumlocutions: men and women who just want to be happy. In the spirit of the founding fathers who created a Europe based on peace, it is up to us today to contribute to a Europe based on social peace.

 Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, what is happening now in the textile sector in the trade between China and Europe presages, in our view, what will happen in many areas over the next few years. We are only seeing the first stage. That is why our present responses to this issue will serve other areas of our industry in the future. We cannot accept the deregulation of international trade without concerning ourselves with the related human, economic and environmental consequences. A case in point is the textile sector where the end of quotas was dreaded and where there have been countless company restructurings, indeed outright shutdowns, in the regions in which this industry is still very prominent. Faced with these human dramas, we are, in a sense, powerless. The introduction of safeguard clauses, the fight against counterfeiting and the supplying of aid for research and information provision are all helpful roads to go down, but we cannot stop there. In paragraphs 18 and 24 of her report, Mrs Saïfi rightly emphasises the need to combat all forms of modern slavery and forced labour, as well as the exploitation of children. Indeed, it will never be possible for our modern economy, based on, among other things, respect for human dignity, to compete faced with such abuses. Mrs Saïfi’s responses, designed to combat these scourges, are insufficient, however. One has to be able to hit where it hurts. That is why, together with 50 of our fellow Members representing four political groups, we have lodged an amendment asking the Commission to consider putting in place an ethical tax on products proven to have been manufactured in violation of all the rules of human dignity and, above all, involving the exploitation of children. It is crucial that an institution like ours serve more than one generation and that it serve to generate hope.

Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, Mr Öry’s report is, in my opinion, an important source of proposals, enabling the Commission and Parliament to take up the challenge of enlargement. In actual fact – and one is well aware of this through the debates currently enlivening the old Member States – the fear of social dumping brought about by enlargement is omnipresent, and, in my opinion, unfounded if adequate elements of a response can be found. I would first of all like, as is unfortunately the custom in this House, to point out to the Commission that, if funding is not made available immediately in order to implement the recommendations contained in this report, it will go unheeded, however comprehensive it may be. The fight against all forms of poverty and all forms of exclusion is the prerequisite for putting Europe onto the road to social progress. We had agreed in the Committee on Employment and Social Affairs that the responses required on the issue of social inclusion were not simply limited to the field of employment, but that they had to include other major social matters: access to education for all, without ethnic or social discrimination, in order to guarantee a common core of knowledge necessary for people to integrate effectively in society; access to quality health care for all: the fact that, even today, people can recover from cancer in one part of Europe and die from influenza in another will never be justifiable; access to housing for all, which is another of the themes of this report: council houses will have to be geographically spread out in an intelligent manner, in order to prevent any form of ghettoisation; the fight against all forms of discrimination, whether sexual discrimination in the workplace, racial discrimination or discrimination linked to disability or social circumstances, will have to be encouraged and supported. Europe has now to offer protection: in order to progress, it must primarily be able to protect its people. The basic principles of employment, housing, training and health care are the very foundation of what ought to be the construction of Europe, a Europe that serves Europeans.

Madam President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, no to the 60-hour week, the opt-out must disappear. It is without any hesitation whatsoever that I endorse the text presented by Mr Cercas. I will support it first of all by referring to the good sense that demands that we work to live and not the reverse. Good sense alone will tell us that, with the exception of jobs clearly demanded by those who carry them out, the reality of working 60 hours per week - or worse still, 63 hours with the authorisation granted in 1993 – as is the case in certain countries in the European Union, will pose problems in terms of adapting to one’s personal, family and social environment in the long run. In the social field, as in that of politics, progress gives way to compromise. The desire to extend the practice of 60 or 65 hours of working time is at odds with social progress. In this regard, the opt-out must disappear.

Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, in this lengthy debate here today, I should like to take a few moments, if you would allow me, to reflect on the road we have travelled until now. Let us remember the initial positions of some Members of this Parliament in the face of increasing concern in the African, Caribbean and Pacific (ACP) countries, in the face of demonstrations against the Economic Partnership Agreements (EPAs), in the face of warning signals from NGOs from the North as well as the South, when we were demanding that the priority in these agreements should be development, something that seems obvious today, as the Commission is constantly repeating it. Mr Mandelson, however, at the time, scarcely dared to answer us because, for him, it was primarily a matter of stimulating trade, as if simply removing customs barriers would somehow miraculously bring about development. People called us idealists, manipulated by the NGOs, and were offended by our demands for instruments for protection, regulation and intervention by public authorities, but what happened? It appeared that we were not being irresponsible. No, the governments of the ACP countries did not accept continuing negotiations under pressure or threats. No, the risks involved in opening up trade are not an attitude of mind, they are real and will have real and immediate consequences: state budgets will be reduced through loss of customs revenues, new industries in the agricultural sector will be weakened and the food security of their people put at risk. We were expressing these fears a long time ago, before the hunger riots or the financial crisis. So, what is to be said about the situation today? The International Monetary Fund, the World Bank and the United Nations recognise that developing countries, contrary to what was said at the outset, will be seriously affected by the global recession. Jacques Diouf, Director-General of the Food and Agriculture Organisation, emphasised this recently, asking whether we would dare to say to those we call partners that we are prepared to spend billions to save the global banking system but not to save their people who are dying of hunger. I want to be completely honest, Commissioner, and I wish this to be quite clear. If you do not make a strong and precise commitment on behalf of the Commission to give us a guarantee that the EPAs will be genuinely pro-development, I will not vote for assent. Words will not be enough and nor will declarations of intent, we have heard too much of those. We want specific commitments and I would like to list them one by one. The EPAs will not be satisfactory agreements unless they promote regional integration and contribute to development in the ACP countries and to the achievement of the Millennium Development Goals. When we call for the promotion of regional integration, that needs to be translated into practical terms. For example, in Central Africa, Cameroon has been criticised, not to say strongly condemned, by its neighbours, for having signed this interim agreement with the European Union. Out of the eight countries in the region, I note that five are Least Developed Countries, that is, countries that, automatically and fully in accordance with the rules of the World Trade Organisation, have free access to the European market for exports without any requirements for trade concessions in return. I can quite understand their concerns when the Commission asks them to open up to 80 % of European exports. Therefore, if the Commissioner makes a commitment to promoting regional integration, if she makes a commitment to greater flexibility so as to take into account the different levels of development of our partners, perhaps she can tell us why she does not accept the offer of 71 % liberalisation proposed by Central Africa? The second fundamental subject for which we are awaiting a response concerns the Singapore Issues. These cannot be imposed in the negotiations against the wishes of the partner countries. On this point, I want particularly to emphasise public procurement. Of course, there must be transparency – I shall always defend that – but can we deprive our ACP partners of an essential instrument of their sovereignty in supporting their industry and their local services by imposing liberalisation of public procurement? The third point is services. In our discussions about EPAs with Cameroon, the Commission stressed time and again that our partners wanted to negotiate about services. That may be true, but, nonetheless, beware of those who would use this argument to impose liberalisation of services on all regions and all countries, and especially to justify liberalisation of public services. Commissioner, I expect a firm commitment from you that public services will remain outside the scope of the negotiations, in all regions. We know that the loss of customs revenue will cause a reduction in the budgets of our partners. If revenues are reduced, the first sectors to suffer will be sectors such as education, health or research. It would, therefore, be unacceptable for the ACP governments in this context to lose control of their public services and I call upon the Commissioner to give us her firm assurance on these issues. The fourth point, and this has already been mentioned, is that food security must be protected. This involves not only putting in place adequate safeguards, but also allowing our partners to sustain their exports in order to remain competitive in global markets. I know that there have been some positive developments in this direction in the Southern African Development Community region. Is the Commission prepared to propose similar measures in other regions? The last point is that we know that upgrading the economies of ACP States will require a huge financial commitment from the European Union both to protect infant industries from the negative effects of liberalisation and to develop the competitiveness of our partners’ economies. Unfortunately, contrary to the repeated recommendations of our political group, it is the European Development Fund that is to be used as the primary source of funding for the EPAs. We know that in the past the Commission has not been outstanding in the way it makes use of these funds, and I must, therefore, stress how important it is for these funds to be used quickly and according to the priorities of our partners. Finally, Commissioner, these agreements are the image that the European Union will give to the rest of the world, the image that the European Union will give to the poorest countries in the world.

 On Wednesday, our Parliament expressed its opinion on the future free trade agreement between the European Union and India. Thanks to the work of the socialists, the text adopted in committee points out the economic and social fragility of India, a country in which 80% of the population lives on less than USD 2 per day. To confront this reality, the Socialist Group in the European Parliament has tabled a number of amendments pointing out that any strengthening of the EU’s trade relations with India should be accompanied by a strict framework, to prevent any liberalisation of public services, to guarantee access to public healthcare and essential medicines, and to protect the interests of the most vulnerable people and sectors. Unsurprisingly, the right in Parliament has formed an alliance to propose a much more liberal text in plenary, calling in particular for the liberalisation of banking, insurance, postal services and public procurement. In Wednesday’s vote, I will be defending the socialist vision of fair and equitable trade and I will oppose any attempt by the right to go back on these principles.

 Madam President, Mrs Vassiliou, ladies and gentlemen, the images of the 1999 storm, which was just mentioned and which hit south-west France causing tremendous damage, are still engraved on our collective memory. It is an understatement to say that Europe was not prepared to endure such a tragedy again, so soon. There are those who view it as a blow dealt by fate, but I see it rather as a horrendous example of the climate change which you have just referred to, Mrs Vassiliou, for which we merely propose rough solutions whereas in fact urgent action is needed. This is a situation that we must handle responsibly. Unfortunately, we need to be prepared to face even more natural disasters. On 24 and 25 January this year, storm Klaus, which hit southern Europe, killed 11 people in France, 14 in Spain and three in Italy. It caused significant damage, destroying schools and many homes, depriving thousands of people of electricity, heating, drinking water and a telephone service and leaving certain economic sectors in a critical situation, as in the case of the timber industry. While I am keen to express my solidarity with the families of the victims and all those affected, and my support for local councillors, I would like to take advantage of this forum to call on the European Community since, it has to be said, this kind of situation requires a European response and, first and foremost, European solidarity. Admittedly, in France a state of natural disaster has been declared, which will facilitate aid to disaster victims, but this does nothing to detract from the need to take coordinated European action to supplement the Member States’ efforts to protect people, the environment and property in disaster-stricken towns and regions. In practical terms, this primarily entails centralising information at European level in order to make a precise assessment of the damage. We must then release the necessary funds to provide support for local authorities that are facing huge challenges. In particular we should support the public services, which have been doing an exceptional job, and which we desperately need in order to repair infrastructure and equipment in the energy, water-supply, sewage, transport and telecommunications, health and education sectors. Past disasters showed that action at European level is urgent and enabled the prevention of natural risks to be included as one the goals of the European Regional Development Fund. From now on, Europe must prove its ability to react and to translate its solidarity into practical measures. I therefore hope, although you have just said so, that the Commission will take this message on board and mobilise all means necessary to respond to this urgent situation, in particular through the EU Solidarity Fund and the Civil Protection Financial Instrument. Lastly, in conclusion, I would like to remind you that, as with the fires in Greece in 2007, this violent storm has demonstrated the need for a civil protection force that can be mobilised in all crisis areas. I would like to hear your opinion on this subject, Mrs Vassiliou, as well as your response to Parliament’s request in its resolution of 27 April 2006, seeking the creation of a European observatory on natural disasters to ensure a more effective European response when these unfortunate events occur.

On Thursday Parliament will give its verdict on Mr Schröder’s report on Economic Partnership Agreements (EPAs). I would be extremely disappointed if our institution’s first vote on this both very technical and highly political subject (since the whole future of our relations with the ACP States is at stake) were to result in the adoption of Mr Schröder’s report. The Socialist Group in the European Parliament will not vote in favour of this text, since it in no way reflects the concerns both of Europeans and of our ACP partners about the EPAs and the way in which they are negotiated. In contrast to the rapporteur’s position, the PSE Group has tabled and will vote in favour of a motion for a resolution which puts development back at the heart of the EPAs’ priorities, which rejects the liberalisation of public services and any negotiation on the Singapore issues or on services against the ACP States’ wishes, which promotes regional integration, which calls for huge financial support to bring the ACP States’ economies up to standard, and which takes account of the specific characteristics and fragilities of these countries, be they least developed countries or otherwise. These are the conditions that would make the EPAs acceptable agreements. Unfortunately we are still a long way away from them.

The action taken by Parliament in the wake of the food riots has enabled EUR 1 billion to be released to combat the food crisis. This emergency measure aside, I should like to stress the need for a long-term international strategy that is based on local and subsistence agriculture and that is appropriate to the needs of populations and to the potential of territories. Indeed, the world population increase, global warming, the uncontrolled production of biofuels and aggressive speculation are so many factors that are increasing the tension on the agricultural markets. These elements indicate that the crisis will not be short-lived and that public policies as a whole will have to be rethought in order to improve production methods and the regulation of international markets. I believe that the CAP, with its excesses and imperfections ironed out, could become an example of effective, fair and responsible policy, rising to the food challenge and uniting at the same time the economy, society and the environment. It should also help developing countries by sharing European techniques, knowledge and experience. However, Europe should first and foremost work on reforming international trade rules so that they do not oppose the right of countries to support their agriculture in order to guarantee their food security.

In the Community budget for 2009, we, the Socialist Group in the European Parliament, proposed and obtained the adoption of a preparatory action for developing social tourism in Europe. This project responds to the finding that many citizens are prevented from travelling for economic reasons and that this inequality needs to be corrected by guaranteeing everyone access to holidays. However, it is also useful in terms of territorial planning and local development. By combining social mixing with local development and by providing access to members of the public for whom going on holiday is difficult, social tourism makes the tourism sector more profitable. It therefore provides opportunities to develop off-season tourism, particularly in regions in which this sector is highly seasonal, and encourages the creation of more permanent-type jobs in this economic sector. Thus, social and community tourism illustrates that there is indeed an intermediate sector between the leisure market and the non-creditworthy economy and that economic relevance is not incompatible with providing access to as many people as possible. The sector also helps to strengthen European citizenship by means of exchanges between European citizens. This just shows how important this sector is, in terms both of economic returns and of public resources.

 The common position on working time that the Council put to the vote by Parliament was a real step backwards for workers’ rights and a genuine threat to our European social model. Gathering a strong majority behind him, the socialist rapporteur, Mr Cercas, whom I supported with my vote, has managed to bring down this conservative and reactionary vision of the world of work, which is worthy of the 19th century. Along with all socialists, I supported a series of amendments that guarantee essential advances for workers’ rights. We have thus obtained the repeal of the opt-out clause, which allowed people to break away from the limit on working time and impose up to 65 working hours per week. Similarly, because we cannot consider on-call time as rest time, we have enabled it to be counted as working time. We have also obtained guarantees with regard to compensatory rest time and the reconciling of family and professional life. This great victory of the European socialists, supported by the unions, is a victory for all Europeans. The Europe that embraces the major social advances such as those today is the Europe that protects its people.

 Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, since 2001, developing countries have been negotiating a round within the WTO described as the development round. Now in the face of a sudden and devastating food crisis, alerting the world to the urgent need to find a long-term global and balanced solution, these countries expect a clear response from us to guarantee their food security. I would like to confirm that, if the round continued to be about market access at any price, we would not achieve our objective. We also know that, the more we postpone the signing of a development agreement, the further away the prospects are of achieving the Millennium Development Goals, and unfortunately we are already way behind schedule. Faced with this crisis situation, we ask that a political solution be found as soon as possible to the special safeguard mechanism in order to produce an effective protection tool for small producers in poor countries. This is an essential step before continuing negotiations on other aspects, and I hope that the recent resumption of talks on agriculture and non-agricultural market access (NAMA) will allow progress in this respect. Before I finish, I would like to describe the amendments tabled to the joint resolution. The Socialist Group in the European Parliament will of course ask us to vote in favour of Amendment 2, which is absolutely essential for increasing the rights of Parliament in international trade. We also support the amendments tabled by The Greens/European Free Alliance, but we cannot accept the amendment tabled by the European People’s Party (Christian Democrats) and European Democrats, for we believe that it is not appropriate, in this resolution on multilateral negotiations, to call for new regional bilateral agreements to be signed, since we know that these are usually negotiated at the expense of the weakest.

 Madam President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, the resolution that we are going to vote on makes a number of recommendations to the Commission, reminding it that, on behalf of the EU, it defends the interests of the Member States and of the European large civil aircraft industry. In view of the fact that the US Congress has already supported Boeing on numerous occasions, and bearing in mind that the infringement of the tanker agreement undermines the position of the European aircraft manufacturer, the unflagging support of the European Union as a whole – the Member States, the Commission and Parliament – is more crucial than ever. This much we know. EADS has been widely criticised and doubts have been raised as regards both its seriousness and its reliability. The Commission must reaffirm two things today: on the one hand, that Boeing’s appeal, in the context of the tanker procurement process, must in no way affect the quality of the proposal for the EADS/Northrop Grumman partnership, because only the selection process has been challenged by Boeing. A reversal of the US Air Force’s decision would be unacceptable. The Commission must be clear in making this point. The Commission must also remember that the attacks on Airbus before the WTO are unjustified. Not only is the system of repayable financing beyond reproach because, by definition, it is repaid, but the position of the United States is all the more surprising, since US aid is incompatible with WTO rules and with the binding agreements between Europe and the United States. To avoid a sterile confrontation that would undermine the industrial interests of the parties concerned and EU/US relations, which we have to improve, the only possible solution for the future is a negotiated one. This must be preceded by a preliminary phase in which both parties demonstrate their goodwill. One final question: does the new situation influence the decision that might be made during settlement of this dispute?

Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, the launch of what was at the time the Mediterranean Union gave rise to controversy and concerns both in Europe and among our Mediterranean partners. This initiative clearly could not be a purely Franco-French or Euro-European initiative, nor the expression of a security-oriented vision of Euro-Mediterranean relations. I therefore welcome the Commissioner’s words this morning and the specific proposals put forward, which respond to some of our concerns. This common project must consist of collective dialogue, based on parity and co-management. However, the Euro-Mediterranean relationship is an asymmetric relationship that is both emotive and irrational. It is obviously asymmetric when it comes to trade: both North-South trade and South-South trade. We therefore need to look at whether or not a free trade zone should be set up in 2010. It is irrational because it is based on relations linked to a history that is often painful and complicated, and that is today magnified by what certain conservatives want, namely the clash of civilisations, a confrontation between the Western bloc and the Eastern bloc. Consequently, if had to take decisions, the first would be to look at this Euro-Mediterranean relationship dispassionately and rationally. We must be rational in terms of strengthening the role of the parliaments, notably the role of the EMPA; we must be rational in terms of our proposals on good governance; we must be rational in terms of the aid that can be provided from a South-South perspective; we must be rational, too, when it comes to the free movement of people and the Israel-Palestine issue. We also need to be dispassionate because if we cannot we will not create this area of peace and we will not prevent this clash of civilisations that some people desire.

 Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, when Parliament voiced its opinion on the application of the GSP for the 2005-2008 period, the Commission did not see fit to incorporate its proposals. We stand by these priorities today, particularly the fact that Parliament must be more involved in the allocation and monitoring of the various GSP schemes. The role of representatives of civil society, and social partners in particular, must also be strengthened. They represent a valuable source of information when checking that the main conventions governing the allocation of GSP+ have been implemented. On this point, I am pleased that the new regulation will be tougher on the respect for good governance provisions relating to workers’ rights, human rights and the environment. The Union must have faith in its values and encourage its trading partners not only to ratify its conventions, but also to implement them concretely. This is why we are asking the Commission to incorporate one of our proposals which is essential for the GSP+ to continue acting as an incentive. At present, a country which is not eligible for GSP+ from 2009 will have to wait until the introduction of the next regulation in 2012 in order to reapply. We would like it to be possible to submit new applications every year so that developing countries have a real incentive to implement these conventions as soon as possible to benefit from the GSP+. Finally, I would like to remind everyone of the need to reform the rules of origin in order to have a global, simplified and harmonised system based on strengthening regional integration, which remains its primary vocation. Calculations of national added value must therefore take into account the particular situation of poor countries, which are not able to benefit if the rules of origin are too restrictive. With the GSP, the Union has a means of fostering not only the integration of developing countries within world trade, but also of spreading good governance. Parliament’s proposals would allow progress on both counts. We hope that they will be incorporated by the Commission.

 Madam President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, I welcome the debate this evening on Mrs Muscardini’s report on the reform of the World Trade Organisation. The food crisis that is currently hitting the developing countries hard illustrates perfectly the urgent need for better regulation of global trade. This should come from a reformed WTO that is capable of controlling globalisation prices and promoting fairer trade rules. This crisis is structural, not cyclical. It is a sign that serious problems are diverting global trade from what should be its main objective: ensuring the development of all, notably the poorest countries on the planet. A number of theories have been put forward to try to explain the origin of this crisis and I do not doubt their relevance. However, I think that collectively we should ask ourselves a number of questions. Would this crisis have been as extensive if the priorities of the developing countries had been given greater consideration in the WTO? If there had been better coordination of the WTO and other international organisations such as the UNDP and the FAO? If our free trade agreements had not encouraged the developing countries to specialise in single crops for export, to the detriment of their traditional subsistence crops and food self-sufficiency? If we had listened to the African countries and supported them in the WTO when they asked that action on the price of basic products be included in the current round of negotiations? In this respect, I must point out that Article 38 of the GATT requires all WTO members to stabilise and improve the situation of the markets for primary products, which are of particular importance for developing countries. In order to deal with the current problems and improve the efficiency and legitimacy of the WTO, this report proposes several measure. In order to ensure that the voices, the points of view and the interests of developing countries are better heard and, indeed, taken into account, it emphasises the need to introduce a more democratic system of decision-making and better representation in the WTO secretariat, which must also be provided with additional financial and human resources. In order to guarantee greater transparency of the organisation’s debates and work, provision should be made for better information, dialogue between the organisation and representatives of civil society, and public access to meetings, particularly for the dispute settlement procedure. Finally, the WTO’s parliamentary dimension, which guarantees the democratic legitimacy and transparency of negotiations, must be strengthened. That includes, in particular, the creation of a WTO parliamentary assembly with consultative powers. In addition to these measures, the very aims of the multilateral trading system must be reviewed with a view to ensuring consistency with the other international organisations. Only a committed reform in this regard will allow us to conclude a Doha Round that is truly working towards development and towards achievement of the Millennium Goals. I would point out in this respect that the first of these goals is the eradication of poverty and hunger; sadly the current situation reminds us that our commitments remain unfulfilled.

Madam President, as already stated, the European Union has been negotiating the conclusion of a free trade agreement with the Gulf Cooperation Council for nearly 20 years. Since then the Commission’s negotiating mandate has barely changed and has certainly not been properly updated. The result is a somewhat surprising situation whereby the Union is not using the same criteria as a basis for its negotiations with the Gulf states as it uses with its other trade partners, such as Korea or the ASEAN countries. In particular, the negotiating mandate makes no provision for inclusion in the future agreement of any clause on social standards, nor any ambitious chapter on sustainable development. The issue of respect for human rights is scarcely mentioned. Since these elements must be part of the priorities of European action, not only should they be fully integrated in the future free trade agreement, they should also be subject to suspension clauses for cases where the commitments are not fulfilled. It is the EU’s responsibility to ensure that all the trade agreements it negotiates guarantee promotion of, and respect for, the democratic principles of human rights, the conventions of the International Labour Organisation and environmental standards. In the case of the Gulf states, special attention – and Mr Martin has just mentioned this – must be paid to the living conditions and rights of migrant workers. There are many such workers in the region to support the rapid growth there but they often work under disgraceful and unacceptable conditions. More generally, over and above the trade that must be developed within the framework of harmonious trade relations, Europe and its Member States must step up their political and social dialogue. We must therefore implement a free trade agreement that not only does not have a negative impact on the people living in the region but, on the contrary, consolidates their political, economic and social rights. That is why it is essential, for example, to ensure that during negotiations on services, the need to guarantee a universal public service that is accessible, sustainable and cheap, and that meets high quality standards, is respected.

Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, what has just been said demonstrates that your proposal was at the very least controversial. At the start, however there was no debate to be had. The Commission had launched an independent study and a public consultation, both of which indicated that there was a broad consensus on the efficiency and stability of the current system. The only improvements sought by the various parties involved were for greater transparency, greater speed and better access for SMEs. However, masking this reality, the Commission introduced a reform that will go down in history for the general opposition that it has created. Trade unions and businesses alike, along with most of the members of the Council, protested against a plan that threatened the Union’s capacity to defend itself against unfair trading practices. The Commission has withdrawn its proposal and I am very pleased about that. The approach that it favoured was in fact dangerous and had sown seeds of division. It is worth pointing out that the Commission’s role is to ensure solidarity between Member States and to respect the various interests that exist, not to be divisive by playing consumers against workers, or importers against producers. Commissioner, may I remind you that any project for reform requires two things: it has to take account of the recommendations and results of its own investigations and it has to inform the Members of this House in advance of the precise direction the proposal is to take, especially when it comes to its more controversial aspects.

Mr President, Commissioner, if you are considering a new reform project that is close to the original version, how can you imagine defending before the WTO a policy that penalises dumping when it is practised by foreign companies but accepts it when it benefits European businesses? The problem is knowing not who produces the goods that are arriving in Europe but rather whether they are being exported under fair and equitable conditions. We cannot accept that a company claiming to be European, and that practises dumping, would become unchallengeable simply because it is European according to your new definition. What is more, given that this debate is to be held on a multilateral level, why not be even more visionary and include social and environmental dumping within the scope of the trade defence instruments? It would serve Europe well, and be greatly to its credit, if it were to be in the vanguard of this campaign.

 Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, a few weeks after the end of negotiations on the Memorandum of Understanding introducing restrictions on imports of Chinese textiles, it is essential that the European Parliament adopts a strong position on the future of its textiles sector, the structures and organisational methods of which are threatened by its sudden entry into competition with China. The joint resolution we are proposing today asks for a clear commitment from the European Commission and the Member States on several points. Firstly, for companies and workers in the sector who face major restructuring risks to be fully supported by adequate social measures and by the granting of European funds to support the modernisation of their production facilities. Next, we need to commit ourselves to improving the competitiveness of the European textiles sector within the more general framework of a strong and ambitious European industrial policy. This objective cannot be achieved until words turn into actions and until we invest heavily in research and development. Furthermore, in view of unfair competition from some of our competitors, who base their competitive advantages on social and environmental dumping, or both, Europe needs effective tools to defend itself. Greater efficiency will not be achieved by means of hurried reform, which will weaken the EU’s means of protection, but by the more transparent and predictable use of existing instruments. Finally, Europe needs to use the Euro-Mediterranean partnership as the foundation for an integrated manufacturing area that makes the most of the proximity of the Mediterranean countries to increase competitiveness in the international textiles market. The development of the Mediterranean countries with which we want to create a partnership depends on our ability to offer them firm commitments on policies and sectors of common interest.

 Mr President, I would first like to thank Mr Martin for the quality of his report. When negotiating this future trade agreement with Korea, we would do well to remember that our priority should remain multilateralism, because we know that the excessive proliferation of bilateral agreements is damaging to the regulated multilateral structure that we belong to. That is why, if we enter a new era of bilateral trade agreements, these should include guarantees and principles, some of which are mentioned in Mr Martin’s report. The future free trade agreement with Korea should be up-to-date and include restrictive environmental and social requirements such as those in the fundamental ILO conventions, which aim to promote proper working conditions. Moreover, following Parliament’s commitment to enable better access to generic medicines, I am delighted that the provisions on public health have been included and that our wish has been respected that any demands that would limit our partners’ ability to make use of the flexibilities provided for in the atypical Doha declaration agreement should not be included. On the other hand, despite its positive points, it is unacceptable that this text makes no reference to the fate of workers in the Kaesong free trade area, as our rapporteur wanted, and I deplore this.

 Madam President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, I am pleased to present this report to you today on the allocation of macro-financial assistance (MFA) to Lebanon. This is testimony to the EU pledge to help the country recover from successive crises. Lebanon is currently one of the world’s most debt-ridden countries, with a debt-to-GDP ratio of 180%. The impact of the civil war between 1975 and 1990, the 2006 summer crisis with Israel, chronic political instability and an economic policy set adrift have caused a serious economic, financial and social crisis. The reality of this situation calls for urgent action to be taken. It transpires that funds in connection with the adoption in January 2007 of the EU-Lebanon Action Plan as part of the European Neighbourhood Policy will not be available until 2009. The exceptional MFA we are set to adopt will bridge that gap and will have an immediate impact on public finances and the balance of payments in Lebanon, provided it is implemented immediately. The MFA will consist of a donation of 30 million euros and a loan of 50 million euros to help the Lebanese Government take on post-war reconstruction and continue its economic revival. My report fully approves the need to secure this financial assistance for Lebanon. It does, however, introduce a number of amendments to the Council’s proposal for the sake of clarity and transparency. First and foremost, we ought to bear in mind that the assistance must be strictly complementary to the finance agreed by the Bretton Woods institutions, the Paris Club, bilateral donors and the EU under other programmes. It must be coherent with EU external action or policies and guarantee the added value of the Community undertaking. The Council will also need to explicitly and publicly take up Parliament’s recommendations as to the conditions and criteria attached to the assistance, in other words improved transparency and increased sustainability of public finances, application of the budgetary and macro-economic priorities defined, implementation of specific measures to prevent any risk of fraud, corruption and misuse of funds, distribution of assistance with a fair balance among post-conflict expenditure, reconstruction, excessive debt and the social needs of the population, and full compliance with international democratic and human rights standards and the fundamental principles of the rule of law. Provision of aid for Lebanon must be accompanied by real progress on the objectives mentioned, and this must be set out in a grant agreement drawn up jointly with the Lebanese authorities. In addition to our basic work on this text, I also wish to mention some of the difficulties encountered while the report was being drawn up, given its urgent nature. It is for this reason that, for any future decision relating to the granting of MFA, the Commission and the Council must provide us with much more notice. For Parliament to carry out its work satisfactorily, it must have better-quality information in good time. In this regard, implementation of an early warning system by the Commission would ensure faster handling of the dossier by the competent committee in Parliament and avoid unnecessary delays which might have a serious negative impact on the final beneficiary of the financial aid. The quality and coherence of our work and the quality of our cooperation with the other institutions rely heavily on this factor. In line with previous Parliament resolutions, I wish to stress that such a substantial instrument cannot be simply regarded as exceptional. It must have a regular legal basis and cannot be based on ad hoc
 Council decisions for each operation. A framework regulation on MFA, laid down under the codecision procedure, is necessary in order to enhance transparency, accountability, monitoring and reporting systems. We must also make rapid arrangements for interinstitutional discussions as to the most suitable legal basis for this kind of instrument. In the case of MFA for Lebanon, one of the countries covered by the European Neighbourhood Policy and also classified as a developing country, we feel that the legal basis for this action should have been Article 179 of the EC Treaty instead of Article 308 of the EC Treaty. It is precisely because Lebanon is a developing country that Parliament insists on not neglecting the social aspect of the reforms that the Lebanese Government might undertake. According to the United Nations Development Programme (UNDP), nearly 24% of Lebanese live in complete destitution, and 52% of Lebanese are considered underprivileged. Moreover, nearly 9% of the population are illiterate, less than one-third of the population reach primary school level, and only 13% of Lebanese reach university. Despite this reality, it must be said that the social question is not currently at the centre of Lebanese political debate, and the social content of envisaged reform is extremely limited with respect to economic and financial concerns. It is, however, in the interests of Lebanon and its partners, as I have already said, to find a fair balance between the various items of expenditure, particularly funds for education and training. It must be borne in mind that persistent social inequalities may have serious economic and political consequences which could prolong the country’s instability.

Mr President, I intend to speak specifically about the Mediterranean region which, as the rapporteurs have reminded us – and I thank them for doing so – is very important to Europe in foreign-policy terms. It is my support for substantial European commitment in the Mediterranean region that prompts me to warn against the risks of diluting Europe’s Mediterranean policy within its overall neighbourhood policy. We do not want to see rivalry developing between eastern European countries and our southern neighbours. The ENP should bilaterally complement the multilateral Barcelona Process, which, I would remind you, has been the framework of reference for structuring relations in the Mediterranean region since 1995. That being so, neither the ENP nor any other project directed at the Mediterranean countries should be allowed to obscure or replace the Barcelona objectives, based on the three pillars of partnership in political, economic and social development, which are the only way of promoting effective regional integration. I therefore need to highlight two points. First, we must maintain a balance in apportioning funding between the eastern European and the Mediterranean countries. Our ability to sustain a strong and ambitious European policy for the Mediterranean region depends on getting that balance right. Secondly, with regard to the projected Euro-Mediterranean Free Trade Area – the subject of my report to the House earlier this year – I would emphasise the importance of a coordinated and gradual approach, enabling the countries concerned to cope with the pace and intensity of an open trading system, while taking account of their own specificities and particularly the fragility of some sectors of their economy. Trade that serves the cause of development must remain our aim. In conclusion, I should like to see these aspects addressed in the report because they are necessary to the definition of a clear Mediterranean policy based on a strategic long-term vision of development and stabilisation in this region.

Madam President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, I welcome this debate and the Commission’s presence here to discuss the legal dispute between Europe and the United States, which has been running since 2004, when Washington took a case in the WTO against the European aid granted to Airbus. Faced with this attack, Europe, and the European Commission in particular, must show determination and conviction in order to defend a sector of undoubted economic importance. Indeed, the civil aviation sector in Europe, of which Airbus is the jewel in the crown, is the global showcase for European collaboration and European technological expertise. Now that the US Congress has pledged its full support for Boeing, it is the duty of the European Commission and Europe as a whole to make a political commitment to the Airbus cause. Just a few weeks before the WTO’s dispute settlement body takes its decision, I believe that it is vital for the European Union to reiterate its support for Airbus. This issue is much more than a simple conflict between two aviation giants. It affects our capacity to defend a certain vision of the European commitment to our major projects and our industries. Our industrial policy must not be limited solely to the Union’s competition policy. The US complaint in the WTO against the European mechanism of repayable loans for the aviation sector is, in my view, unfounded and surprising. It is unfounded because, by definition, the repayable loans are repaid. They are repaid to the extent that the European states have been able to get a return on their investment, and since 1992 Airbus has repaid 40% more than the sums loaned to it. The US criticism is also unfounded because the bilateral agreement signed between the European Union and the United States – broken unilaterally by the US in 2004, as the Commissioner said – authorised direct and indirect public aid to the civil aviation industry. This complaint is surprising because the United States is accusing Airbus of having been subsidised even though Boeing benefits from a quasi-monopoly of extensive equipment programmes of the US army and NASA and public support for military development programmes. Therefore, unlike the indirect US aid that is not repaid and is incompatible with the provisions of the SMC Agreement and 1994 GATT, the system of repayable loans could not be considered to be an infringement of WTO rules. I thus hope that the European Commission defends resolutely this legitimate position. In this respect, and having regard to the extreme importance of this matter for the future of the European aviation sector, what specific arguments does the Commission intend to put forward to defend Airbus in the WTO? I would also like to point out that both the United States and the European Union risk seeing all or part of their public aviation support mechanisms condemned by the WTO. To avoid this, the parties had raised the possibility of an amicable solution. Can the European Commission tell us whether it plans to go down that path as mentioned? It is crucial to explore all possible solutions because the future of thousands of people, companies and regions throughout Europe depends on this sector and a positive outcome to this conflict.

 Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, during our last debate in July on access to medicines, I concluded my comments by calling on the Council and the Commission to make clear and formal commitments that would guarantee Europe’s active involvement in finding new solutions and its desire to be a front runner in the fight for access to affordable medicines for everyone. We could not be content with a debate in which no precise commitments were made, and I note today that, after several months of exchanges between the three institutions, certain proposals we had made and that we really wanted are becoming a reality. First allow me to applaud the parliamentary work done, and done with a constant concern for accountability and openness. The three successive postponements of the vote in Parliament were motivated by a commitment to global public health. This showed us that the word ‘solidarity’ still had meaning in European policies. I would therefore like to thank first of all our rapporteur Mr Susta for his powers of persuasion and capacity for resistance, and all the shadow rapporteurs from the political groups, who throughout these months of collaboration, effort and Common conviction, have risen above party politics to show the quality of work that Parliament can produce. I therefore hope that the Council and the Commission will be able to demonstrate that the commitments made over the last few months during our various exchanges and in the written statement we have received will be respected. These commitments are: that the Member States are free to use all the clauses allowing them to produce generic medicines and export them to developing countries, and not only to poor developing countries; that these developing countries can use all the flexibilities in the Doha Declaration to provide their populations with the essential medicines they need; that the European Union will not negotiate public health-related provisions in negotiations on trade agreements – and I also note the statements by the Commissioner; and finally that the EU will finance projects to develop research and manufacturing capabilities in these countries. These are positive steps forward, and we want to make capital of them now, but I would like nevertheless to say that not all the issues raised by Parliament, or its legitimate concerns, have necessarily met with the desired responses from the other institutions. Our fight for access to medicines for everyone in the world goes on. That is why we will remain extremely vigilant regarding the application of the commitments made by the Council and the Commission today, and at the same time we will continue to demand that all our concerns receive a rapid, adequate response in the coming months. I recall that the first of the commitments made to Parliament was to complete the evaluation of the mechanism that we are to adopt tomorrow. Doubts persist over this, and they need to be addressed. Should that not be the case, in line with the commitments made to the developing countries concerned, the EU should draw the appropriate conclusions to come up with a truly viable, sustainable solution. I am therefore pleased about the commitments made by the Council and the Commission, and I will therefore call upon my group to vote in favour of ratification tomorrow, even though the long weeks of work we have just experienced lead me to think that, far from reaching an end, the collective agreement we have made is only just beginning.

The new Postal Directive against which I voted is a textbook case when it comes to studying the ideological stubbornness of the Commission. Abolishing the reserved area for mail weighing less than 50 grams is as good as signing the death warrant of the public postal service. The Commission and certain Members of this Parliament would have us believe that the ‘universal postal service’ is safeguarded by this Directive. By rejecting the reserved area as a funding method, we are faced with an impossible equation: the Member States – which already have limited budgets – should fund the universal service. There is no economic or rational reason why the ‘reserved area’ should be excluded from the possible funding methods, except to undermine the universal postal service. Job insecurity, a reduction in the number of post offices, an increase in tariffs for private individuals, the end of standardised tariffs and thus of equality of access to the postal service – that is what has just been voted for. I remain convinced that public services can function in an EU-wide network. This is possible and desirable if we want to create a real European Community. This Directive makes us renounce the very function of politics: that of regulating and managing economic activity and the market, in order to achieve objectives relating to land management, solidarity, development and so on.

Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, if we have sought today to question the Council and the Commission, it is because the consent requested of us to amend the TRIPS agreement for the purposes of making the August 2003 transitional solution final is raising many issues. Indeed, following the debate held in parliamentary committee on this mechanism, all the experts heard were unanimous in criticising this solution, which only solves a very small amount of the problems faced by countries that have no pharmaceutical manufacturing capacity and, therefore, the difficulties their populations have in gaining access to health care. Although it was supposed to provide a fast and effective response, this mechanism is deemed to be complex, even inefficient. Despite the commitment made by the Council and the Commission to Parliament, no assessment has been carried out. Doubts therefore remain on this issue. ‘It has never been assessed because it has never been used’ we are told by the Commission, which claims that that does not mean that it is inefficient. That is a fine piece of rhetoric based on a reversal of logic, but it is by no means a well-argued response. The questions being asked by the MEPs are as follows: why has not this solution ever been used? Is it equal to the scope of the problem posed? If not, what new measures ought the Union to introduce in order to achieve the stated objective? There can be no discrepancy between what we say we are going to do and what we actually do. In its declarations, the Union supports the Doha Declaration, the flexibilities of the TRIPS agreement and the Member States that have recourse to them. It also makes a commitment not to call for developing countries to be made subject to new intellectual property rules that are more stringent than those laid down at the WTO, as that would undermine genuine access to treatment. However, these declarations have not been put into practice. Let us start by understanding what we mean. For example, what do we mean by flexibility? In our opinion, this concept encompasses all the flexibilities, not just the 2003 solution. However, in its declarations, the Commission refers solely to that one. As for the intellectual property rules that go beyond the TRIPS agreement, how do we define them? Do we identify the same ones? In its declarations, the Commission refrains for resorting to such rules, but the negotiations that have been conducted do not necessarily reflect this commitment. The Commission’s representatives even at times justify its resorting to these rules for the sake of combating counterfeiting, but this comes under an entirely different debate. Finally, clear political support must be given to every country that uses a flexibility instrument, whatever it may be, which is not the case in practice. What we are asking for is transparency and a balance between the public discourse and the negotiations conducted behind closed doors. We are convinced that the problem raised goes far beyond our simply assenting to an international protocol. This is a far-reaching political and humanitarian problem that requires a genuine political will to match the challenge posed. We now want clear commitments, and commitments on many points, all of which are included in our resolution due to be put to the vote tomorrow. This hinges on a joint policy statement, with Parliament, before our vote. We will not be content with yet another debate that lacks any precise commitment. We want a solemn commitment by the Council and the Commission that guarantees that Europe will become more involved in finding new solutions and that it will strive to do as our fellow citizens want and become a leading player in the fight to secure access to medicines at affordable prices for everyone in the world.

Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I should like to point out a few fundamental principles and express some concerns about the new trade strategy being advocated today by the Commission and taken up in the report by our fellow Member, Mr Caspary. The first principle to point out is that priority must always be given to multilateralism. We know that the excessive proliferation of bilateral agreements seriously harms the regulated multilateral structure, to which we adhere. The second principle is that we should not undermine the Union’s commitment to a trade policy that promotes development, a policy integrating non-commercial dimensions, such as decent work, access to medicines, the environment and the eradication of poverty. As for my concerns, they relate to three points. The first is that priority is no longer given to the pro-development dimension of the Doha Round in the future free trade agreements and the new EU trade agenda, even though the EU’s trade policy objectives should always be compatible with its development policy and should usefully supplement it, particularly where social and environmental issues are concerned. My second object of concern is the scope of these agreements, which go far beyond the current WTO provisions. For example, the principle of full reciprocity to which we aim to give priority, including for emerging countries faced with large-scale poverty, is unacceptable. We must enable developing countries temporarily to protect the fragile and sensitive sectors of their economies. In short, we must not impose on others that which we do not know how to impose on ourselves. My last concern, to conclude, relates to the provisions aimed at negotiating on the so-called Singapore issues. These very controversial issues were excluded from the Doha Round following widespread opposition from developing and emerging countries. The controversy had previously resulted in the failure of Cancún. We know that these issues, which are as complex for the Union as they are for our partners, raise sensitive questions, relating to internal policy and, therefore, to the very sovereignty of the Member States. These issues could, moreover, have a considerable impact on the economic and social models and, therefore, on the very development of our partners. It is vital that the Union does not push for these issues to be included in the negotiations. Nothing could justify that which has been thrown out the door of a multilateral round coming back in through the narrow window of a bilateral agreement. What is at stake here is our consistency, our credibility and a certain development model that we have always sought to promote.

Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, the negotiation of the economic partnership agreements between the Commission and the ACP countries is giving rise to the deepest concerns among these countries and is taking place in a climate that is incompatible with the historical partnership relationship that unites us. Europe is perceived as seeking to impose at any price free trade areas on countries that are among the poorest in the world, and under its conditions. The relationship of trust with the ACP countries is now at stake. We must re-open the negotiations on new foundations so as to address the concerns raised in the ACP countries concerning the impact of the EPAs on the future of their economies, many sectors of which could not withstand the lowering of customs protections or a situation in which they face uncontrolled competition with the European economy. The Commission must revert to the principles laid down in the Cotonou Agreement. The aim is development, not reciprocity when it comes to opening up markets. Such a principle would be at odds with the aim set, given the inequalities in development that will not disappear in 20 years’ time. Thus, these countries must have the opportunity to choose between an EPA and another form of preferential agreement. We must offer those who have not signed an EPA by the end of 2007 market access that is at least equal to the preferences from which they benefit now, with none of them having to find themselves back in a more unfavourable situation at the end of the agreements. Furthermore, services and the Singapore issues should not be included in the negotiations. The only obligation in terms of compliance with the WTO rules concerns the preferences granted for trade in goods. These issues were taken out of the negotiations within the WTO, at the request of the developing countries. They should not be re-introduced suddenly for the ACP countries. These issues are first and foremost the responsibility of the regional groupings of the ACP countries, whose sovereignty should be respected in this matter. The Commission must therefore withdraw them from the negotiations. Furthermore, the parliaments of the ACP countries and the European Parliament, together with civil society, must have access to all the elements of the negotiations and must be consulted and involved as they take place. Finally, if longer deadlines are needed in order to do a proper job of negotiating good economic partnership agreements, then the Commission must demonstrate flexibility and defend the principle of this before the members of the WTO.

Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, 13 years after the adoption of the European Works Councils Directive, much remains to be done if this legislation is fully to achieve its objectives. Over the last few months, many companies have carried out major restructuring projects, without consultation and regardless of this directive and of other European laws and without any of these companies having ever been punished. The crises that Airbus is going through now, that Alcatel and Volkswagen went through in the past and that Peugeot will perhaps go through in the future, are harsh examples of just what is lacking in European social dialogue. In the case of Airbus, the trade unionists and workers that we met in Parliament or in our respective countries rightly deplored the absence of any prior consultation or true cooperation with regard to the Power 8 restructuring plan. Although we know that managerial errors are at the root of the current difficulties being experienced by Airbus and, at the same time, that it is the skills of its employees that have made it a success, the employees are the last to be informed but the first to be affected – and the most tragically affected – by this plan. As for the managers, they are shielded, because they are covered by the millions of euros of their gilded parachute. We can no longer tolerate a situation in which employees learn through the press that they are being made redundant. We need to act urgently if we are to ensure greater transparency. For several years now, we in the Socialist Group in the European Parliament have been calling for these texts to be revised in a bid to ensure that information and consultation of workers early on, at regular intervals and at all levels of decision making will enable them genuinely to make their presence felt in the decision-making process. Thus, employee representatives ought to be able to sit on the management board of companies. This is a crucial element when it comes to workers being informed about, and monitoring, strategic decisions. This is what would make it possible, too, to ensure that these restructuring measures were really crucial to the business and not just linked to managerial errors or to the quest for immediate profit. We also think it crucial to ensure that companies within the Union assume their social and financial responsibilities and act in accordance with a method of governance that is responsible and fair towards all of the parties involved – workers, trade unions, local and regional authorities and communities in the area in which they are based. The Commission must make a commitment to induce companies to act responsibly, including by considering legislation on their social responsibility. It seems to me that, in a globalised setting and in an ever-changing economic situation, it is our duty today, as it was 13 years ago, to ensure that the existing directives are applied in full, including by means of sanctions against irresponsible companies but, even more so, to ensure that the existing directives are revised so that they go further with regard to information and consultation of workers, and to works councils. By doing so, we will make it clear that we are strongly attached to a socially responsible Europe.

Madam President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, I am pleased – even more so after what I have just heard – to present this report to you today. It testifies to the fact that the Union’s Mediterranean policy is a priority for our institution and that it must remain so. The report that I am submitting to you analyses the results of more than 12 years of cooperation laid down in the objectives of the Barcelona Conference. It makes some proposals in favour of the implementation of a mutually beneficial Euro-Mediterranean free trade area. This piece of work, completed over several months, was made possible by the close cooperation that I enjoyed with various experts, NGOs, government representatives of the countries of the Mediterranean and, of course, my fellow MEPs. May I thank them for their cooperation. This sound collective knowledge, sustained by the constructive work of the shadow rapporteurs – to whom I am sincerely grateful – has enabled me, I believe, to come up with a balanced text that reflects all of the worries and questions. This spirit, this overall balance reinforced by the vote in committee, must guide tomorrow’s vote in plenary. First and foremost, we must establish something. Although each part of the world has its own specific nature, relations between the Union and the countries of the southern Mediterranean are marked by the weight of history, a history of conflict, lack of understanding and instability, a troubled, even tragic, history. That is why I have tried to draft this report above all from an eminently political perspective. A hope was born with the Barcelona Summit in 1995. The political will demonstrated was to build a global partnership between the European Union and the countries of the Mediterranean basin, with the aim of making this region a common area of peace, stability and prosperity. However, we must conclude, today, that the results are not equal to the hopes and expectations. Since then, we have been living in an unstable political context: the war in Lebanon, the lack of peace prospects in the Middle East, complex relations since 11 September 2001 between the Western world and Arab-Muslim countries and strained relations between the partners of the South. Added to that is the idea – which I consider mistaken – that Europe does not give priority to its relationship with the countries of the southern Mediterranean. One might add to this list of concerns the fear of seeing the Barcelona philosophy and the new neighbourhood policy advocated by the European Union weakened. That would spell the end of convergence and the introduction of divergence, fuelled by competition between countries. The context is also one of asymmetry in the three areas of the economy, society and demographics. This striking asymmetry between the two parties to the free trade area, namely the Union and the countries of the Mediterranean, is just as striking between the countries of the Southern Mediterranean and, ultimately, within some of those countries themselves, between coastal and urbanised regions and within rural territories. Faced with all these difficulties, a strong political will is required, but we must also show that we are realistic. It is for that reason and in view of the sometimes considerable delays in implementing the economic and political reforms needed to create a genuine Euro-Mediterranean market that I think it necessary to revise the 2010 deadline as the date on which this free trade area will enter into force. The implications of such an area and the changes that it will bring about call for a more cautious approach on the part of all the partners, particularly when those partners are unequal. When looking ahead to the creation of this free trade area, the main theme must remain the objective of having a form of trade that serves development and the reduction of poverty, particularly in this region in which 30% of the population lives on USD 2 a day and in which mass unemployment and uncontrolled immigration are the only prospects for a growing number of young people. Our priority must be to create a genuine Euro-Mediterranean socio-economic area, integrating all of the social and environmental issues into the economic dimension. That is why I advocate a free trade area that is developed in a progressive, managed, gradual and concerted way. It must also be adapted to the socio-economic situation in each of the countries. Markets cannot be opened up to the detriment of the countries of the South, with the risk that a number of today’s sensitive key sectors will be further weakened, as a result of a competitive struggle. We all know that their agriculture is uncompetitive and not very diverse, with a majority of smallholdings needing their structures modernised, and that it requires us to look more deeply into a form of integrated agricultural policy, centred around food safety. We also know that there are countries in which a form of low-technology and low added value industry has developed, which must be helped by means of investment in the areas of training and research, and also through the modernisation of its production structures; we know that we should not put pressure on these countries to suddenly open up their service markets, while maintaining public services outside the framework of the negotiations. We need to keep a close eye on all of that, otherwise we will have worked to achieve the opposite effect of the development that we wanted and to the detriment of the social well-being of the populations concerned. That is why it seems vital to me that we grant our partners the right to manage the rate at which they open up to trade and the way in which they organise their development strategy. It therefore proves vital to strengthen the overall competitiveness of the economies of the MED countries in order to guarantee their economic diversification, their successful integration into international trade and the fair distribution of the expected benefits; to maintain an asymmetric system based on trade preferences and continued use of supply-side management tools; to attract investment, of which there is little in this area; to provide a stable investment area and to provide for regional Euro-Mediterranean infrastructure and transport networks; and to work towards a closer political and economic alignment in the SEMCs, in order to help genuinely strengthen cooperation and integration. To conclude, I should like to stress the urgent need for a renewal of political will among all of the partners and for the return of real cooperation as one of the Union’s priorities, both of which are conditions essential to the revival and success of the Barcelona process and of a Euro-Mediterranean socio-economic area. Without them, the free trade area is in danger of becoming the symbol of the Euromed misunderstanding. As far as my generation is concerned, it is vital that we move on to a time of reconciliation – that is the challenge that we have to address, ladies and gentlemen. Guaranteeing the stability and development of this area means guaranteeing the development of democracy and of our stability.

 Mr President, I would like to start by expressing my support for all those who work for Airbus or its sub-contractors and who have been told that they now face redundancy. They are now paying the price for the errors of management and administration and the errors committed by uninvolved shareholders who allowed financial considerations rather than the interests of the industry to carry the day, but the solidarity of workers across Europe will be their strength in getting the restructuring plan reviewed. This business also shows just what is lacking in European social dialogue, with workers’ representatives completely absent from the decision-making structures. While this state of affairs is not Europe’s responsibility, Airbus’ status as a flagship and a symbol of European and world industry does mean that a response is expected from Europe, which should say ‘yes’ to the injection of public capital into these businesses, ‘yes’ to repayable advances; ‘yes’ to loans for research and development; ‘yes’ to taking into account the difficulties presented by the EUR/USD exchange rate and ‘yes’ to reforms of business governance and of shareholders’ agreements. For our tools of intervention, we must use the EIB and the Globalisation Adjustment Fund. At present, it is the skills of its workers that assure the company of a future, so let us do likewise through our support for them. (Applause)

 Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I should like to thank Mr Barón Crespo and Mr Guardans Cambó for having taken the initiative in putting this oral question to the Commission. The whole issue of our trade defence instruments is in fact of the utmost importance, not only in that they ensure that European producers are protected effectively against forms of unfair competition, but also when considered within the context of the broader debate on the place of the European Union in a globalised economy and on the rules that it wishes to promote for its governance. Even though the European Union has always defended the WTO’s multilateral system, I think it surprising to say the least that the Commission should launch a public consultation of this kind and be contemplating a potentially major reform of our defence instruments at a time when the WTO negotiations on anti-dumping, anti-subsidy and safeguard measures have not yet been completed and when the results of these will impact upon the way in which these instruments are used. Let me, then, remind the Commission that it did itself commission a study evaluating the European trade defence instruments, the conclusion of which was that the status quo was both the most reasonable solution and the one best suited to addressing the concerns of all parties. This study also lends support to the idea that there is, at the present time, no visible and pressing need to review or amend the Community’s existing trade defence instruments. I would like, therefore, to know just what concrete changes the Commission is planning and how this House is going to be involved in every stage of the process, and I call on the Commission to take account of these different factors within the framework of its forthcoming discussions at Council level, as well as taking account of the views of the Members of this House and of the results of the public consultation that it itself initiated for the purpose of drawing up its future proposals.

Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, though it has come late, I am delighted that the European Parliament is being consulted on this subject. This evening’s debate gives us an opportunity to express our satisfaction once again with the progress introduced by the revision of the agreement, particularly in terms of the improvements between partners, as a result of their policies on protecting human rights and promoting democracy. This consultation is also an opportunity to recall our concerns at the time when the text was being signed. I am thinking in particular of the article that makes the fight against the proliferation of weapons of mass destruction a fundamental aspect of the ACP-EU partnership. Having said that, I would like to stress, or recall, that the priority objective of the cooperation between the two regions was the fight against poverty and the fight for development. Since 2005, new concerns have arisen. They involve the future of our commercial relations with the ACP countries. How can we state, as in the case of the revised Cotonou Agreement, that the Millennium development objectives must underpin ACP-EU cooperation, without worrying about the consequences of future economic partnership agreements for the well-being of the populations of these countries, without carrying out an impact study prior to the launch of the negotiations? How can we emphasise the importance of supporting regional integration organisations created by the ACP countries, while not respecting existing groupings in the negotiations and also knowing that, in the negotiations as they are currently conducted, we cannot take account of the interests of countries of different sizes and different levels of development? The revision of the Cotonou Agreement has above all made it possible to highlight the importance of political dialogue amongst partners. It is on this basis that the European Union and the ACP countries must from now on work towards eliminating misunderstandings, make progressive and constructive progress in the negotiations and reach agreements that are fully in favour of the development of the ACP countries.

Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, it must make us proud to be part of the European Union when we see the action it has taken to promote democracy and human rights. These common values make the Union one of the foremost players on the world stage in this domain. In the context of this unending struggle, it was imperative to reform the old instrument in order to enhance its effectiveness. Thanks to the pugnacity of the rapporteurs, Mrs Flautre and Mr McMillan-Scott, both of whom I congratulate, we have a draft here that truly moves things forward. It befits the importance of this instrument that it should be ambitious, and there is no shortage of ambition in its references to immigrants' rights and in the scope it offers to bypass the need for host-government approval of measures in support of democracy and human rights. I do regret, however, that the negotiations did not result in the extension of the instrument to cover conflict prevention. Moreover, in spite of greater parliamentary involvement in the monitoring process, the Council's refusal to formalise relations between our two institutions in this field is a deficiency. In conclusion, the effectiveness of this instrument will depend on its being regularly evaluated and on its revision, a process in which Parliament must play its full part, because I believe that Europe, armed with its values, is fighting here for a world free from fear.

Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, by adopting the Council regulation of 27 June 2005 reforming the system of preferences that has been in force since 1971, the European Union has chosen to simplify and enhance its principal trade instrument for supporting developing countries. Thus, three systems shall apply from now on: the general system, the Everything but Arms system – which is a tool adapted to the specific characteristics of the least-advanced countries – and, lastly, the GSP+. The additional preferences granted under this last heading arose out of the firm belief that development can be considered only in close conjunction with the democratic process and with respect for human rights, labour law and the environment. Fifteen countries are currently benefiting from this mechanism, which both encourages and rewards those developing countries that are most vulnerable and that make the most efforts in these areas. However, if the GSP+ is to genuinely contribute to better governance and to greater respect for the environment, human rights and employment, it must be managed effectively, and that means, firstly, warning countries that are not fulfilling their commitments – of which there are still many – and, above all, making routine threats so as to effectively do away with the preferences granted to those who seriously and systematically violate the ILO conventions and who do not honour their commitments. Next, it is vital that a regular assessment be carried out to ensure that every country benefiting from the GSP+ is honouring its commitments. The assessment must be particularly exhaustive with a view to the renewal of this instrument at the end of 2008. Our credibility and the effectiveness of this instrument depend on what legal experts call the principle of congruent forms. These preferences cannot continue being granted to countries that are politically incapable of fulfilling these commitments. The same goes for the future of this policy.

 Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, it is a strange conception, as Mr Barón Crespo said, of democratic debate and of the respect due to our institution if the Trade Commissioner and Finnish Presidency are not here to answer our legitimate questions. If the Commissioner had managed to get here, I would have had two questions for him. Why have the anti-dumping duties been imposed for two rather than five years, which is a first in the history of this instrument, and why are the duties so low when there is a blatant violation of the international trade rules and when businesses are suffering serious losses? If the Finnish Presidency had honoured us with its presence, I would not have congratulated it on its biased coordination and on its unwavering support for the position of the big importers and distributors, at the expense of our own industry which is experiencing a number of tragic bankruptcies with the job losses that that entails. Once again, however, financial considerations have prevailed over social considerations and the vital solidarity between countries within the European Union, a solidarity which, if we keep on putting it to the test, tomorrow could end up being the exception and no longer the rule that unites us. To sum up, the position adopted means more unemployment in Europe, a missed opportunity to promote social norms and decent employment, and profit reserved only for importers and distributors: I cannot accept it.

Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, Mr Varela’s report quite rightly reminds us, and he is to be congratulated for it, that Europe and Mercosur would be well advised to strengthen their cooperation. In recent months negotiations with Mercosur have rather come to a standstill, with most of the controversial questions waiting to be sorted out at the WTO. With the recent suspension of the Doha Round, we must henceforth show an unwavering political will to relaunch these discussions. Bilateral negotiations between regions assume a high level of economic and political integration from the two partners. Mercosur, however, seems weakened by the asymmetry of its members and by their sometimes divergent interests. Its institutions, therefore, need to be consolidated, in particular by setting up a regional parliament and a binding instrument for settling disputes. Furthermore, consideration needs to be given in view of Venezuela’s membership which will give, without any doubt, a more political nature to the bloc and will alter the economic balance of power. Since it is very much in the interest of the European Union to negotiate with a strong partner, it has to support politically and financially the emergence of Mercosur as an integrated regional bloc. This area has the authority to reinforce alongside us the multilateral structure and the economic and social model that we hope and pray for.

Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, with only a few weeks to go before the next EU-India summit, we must pay tribute to Europe’s commitment to put more effort into its cooperation with India. This great democracy is not only one of our privileged partners in Asia, but it is also an actor with ever greater responsibilities, both regionally and internationally. It is for that reason that I am grateful to my fellow Member, Mr Karim, for pointing out that our relations with India are not limited merely to the commercial field, but that they are bolstered by extensive cooperation in a vast number of areas. India has embarked on major reforms in relation to the promotion of the Millennium Development Goals, even though that may at times appear insufficient. It has committed itself to protecting the environment, to applying the international standards on labour law and to combating poverty and AIDS. Initiatives such as those must be encouraged and supported by a strong political will and by financial resources that are sufficient to meet the needs of this continent country. Enhanced university cooperation between India and the European Union is indeed crucial, but we must ensure at all costs that we counter any possible brain drain, as that would deprive this country of its greatest asset. Let us not forget that our relations must be guided by the notion of partnership and of mutual exchange. We therefore cannot regard India merely as a huge pool of cheap labour. The optimistic view that we have of our future cooperation with India must not conceal an ever difficult reality. As this report highlights, certain sectors of the Indian economy are very fragile. I am thinking, in particular, of the farming sector, which is suffering from the effects of the uncontrolled liberalisation of trade. That is why I am surprised – and I agree in this respect with what various Members have said – that the conclusion of a free trade agreement should have been proposed. Not only would a decision such as that be premature, but I must point out that the European Union has committed itself to acting first and foremost within the context of the Doha Round. To talk from now on about supporting bilateral negotiations would run counter to the principles that we have been upholding for months and would be a very bad sign for the multilateral structure that we earnestly desire. I shall conclude. If our aim is indeed to have trade work in favour of development, then our trade relations will have to be conceived in a concerted and gradual manner within a rational and solid framework with our partner.

 – (FR
) Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, Commissioner, for all those attached to the multilateral structure, as has just been pointed out, this suspension of the implementation of the Doha Agenda for Development, designed to make trade rules work in favour of development, is very bad news. If it ends in outright failure, we know what awaits us – a proliferation of regional agreements, which always work to the detriment of the weakest. In other words, this would be at complete variance with our objectives, which are aimed at realigning the rules of international trade in favour of the developing countries. This Round ought to enable us to deliver a fairer share of the benefits of globalisation and to take account of differences in levels of development. It should also offer developing countries better access to the markets, without forcing their own markets to open up at any price. Of course, there were some shortcomings in these negotiations, but they also delivered progress, as has been pointed out in this debate. This progress, these victories, deserve to be saved and in this respect I welcome the wish expressed by Mr Mandelson. This wish is indispensable, and it is vital that the negotiations be relaunched. Yet making progress also entails reforms, and the question of the reform of the WTO is on the table today.

Mr President, I would like to begin by warmly thanking Mrs Carlotti for her excellent work, the approach of which I support fully. In the South, migration too often means the departure of the best-trained citizens, a real haemorrhage of skills, depriving those countries of revenue and jeopardising the provision and quality of essential services, which are crucial to their true development. Let us make no mistake: this brain drain is encouraged by the policies of selective admission of migrants implemented in the North, under the name ‘selective migration’ or ‘selective immigration’. Selective immigration in the North always means immigration suffered in the South, a policy which effectively deprives the South of any right to development. In opposition to this approach which has such harmful results, the general philosophy and the concrete measures proposed in this report, such as circular immigration as an alternative to the brain drain, the ‘circulation’ of brains, seem to me to be interesting. We have here the notion of shared immigration, of each party enriching the other. We are talking about promoting co-development, of enshrining it in European texts, without forgetting the funding it requires, of thereby recognising and supporting the role of migrants in the development of their countries of origin. The true intention would be to turn immigration into a lever for development and for mutual aid amongst peoples. I hope that this essential solidarity will dominate the discussions at the forthcoming Euro-African Conference in Rabat. We are all aware of the history of walls being erected in the illusion that they will protect people from each other. They are always destined to be breached and ultimately destroyed.

Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, we are here to draw up a joint response to the rise in racist, anti-Semitic and homophobic violence in our States, and to its consequence, the increasing expression of extreme-right views. It is our duty to hammer home, day after day, this message that we must combat all forms of hate and discrimination on the grounds of ethnic, racial or religious origin or sexual orientation: a duty of tolerance, a duty to teach our children, a duty to remember our history. That would be proof of our complete commitment to human rights. Horror is never far away. Recent tragic events have shaken our consciences and our people. It was not so long ago that a world war founded upon hatred for others devastated our continent. We must always remember that Europe rose from those bitter ashes, on the basis of values of peace and tolerance. We cannot allow any weakness or concession, including in this Parliament. We need strong responses, we must strengthen the legal instruments and rigorously apply those that already exist. It is essential to re-launch the work aimed at adopting the Council’s framework decision. We must stand firm and offer an example, since that is what our values require of us. In response to our Polish colleagues: it is possible to believe in God and not be homophobic.

Europe is undergoing two kinds of crisis: an institutional one and a political one. It is imperative that a strong relationship of confidence be built up again between Europeans and their institutions. The first signal that political leaders have a duty to send out to their fellow citizens in order to restore that confidence is one of equipping themselves with a budget that lives up to their much touted ambitions. At a time when the EU is opening up to new countries and when we more than ever need a social and competitive Europe and one that is strong in the world, the budget now proposed to us is unacceptable. The implementation of the Lisbon Strategy, progress in terms of research and development, education and training, external aid in the fields of development and cooperation, transnational infrastructure projects, and sufficient Structural Funds and a sufficient Cohesion Fund to demonstrate the necessary solidarity with the new countries: all of that will only be achieved to a minimal extent. Moreover, any new policy is out of the question and any recovery unthinkable – this budget symbolises inflexibility and a desire to give in. That is why I cannot vote in favour of the financial perspective. It overlooks the European interest to the advantage of national self-interests and disappoints our nations with regard to Europe’s future.

Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, I should like to thank my fellow Member, Mrs Morgantini, for the excellent report that she has submitted to us today concerning the impact of Economic Partnership Agreements on development. The general philosophy of this text is right. It advocates the necessity for Community solidarity in the face of regulation that carries the risk of uncontrolled liberalisation. This work was welcomed unanimously within the Committee on Development. It is my wish and hope that it will receive the same support in tomorrow’s vote. One essential principle must guide our thinking: development in accordance with, and closely linked to, the Cotonou Agreement. It is a prime objective in all the negotiations and within the framework of the implementation of EPAs with the African, Caribbean and Pacific (ACP) countries. I understand the need to bring trade relations between the European Union and the ACP countries into line with the WTO rules; I am talking about unilateral preferential access between Community markets. Nonetheless, compatibility with the WTO rules must not take precedence over our international commitments to promoting sustainable development and eradicating poverty. I share the fears of our ACP partners and of many NGOs with regard to the way in which negotiations are now conducted by the Commission and with regard to the logic underlying these negotiations. There is, indeed, a glaring asymmetry between the two parties. If we do not attend to this, the swift and harmonious reciprocal opening of markets that is being sold to us will be fatally unbalanced and, I fear, will lead only to disillusionment. This liberalisation of trade between unequal partners, far from promoting development as intended, runs the risk of having devastating effects on the fragile economies of the countries concerned and on their vulnerable populations. And this at the very moment when, in our speeches, we are claiming to want to help these countries to achieve the Millennium Development Goals which, as we already know, are out of reach. I believe that if these agreements are conceived gradually and in a concerted manner, within a rational and predictable framework, in order to promote trade and investment in this area, they will represent a real opportunity for the ACP countries, an opportunity both in terms of economic diversification and harmonious regional integration and in terms of real and successful integration within the world economy. A few priorities must be stated. The first of these is the exclusion of the Singapore issues and of essential public services, without neglecting the principle of the right of these countries to use safeguards to defend their sensitive strategic sectors. The second priority is to respect our commitment to seek out alternative trade systems to EPAs for those countries that request it, as is stipulated in Article 37.6 of the Cotonou Agreement. These alternatives must be based on the principle of non-reciprocity established in the generalised system of preferences (GSP) as well as on the introduction of a clause establishing special, differentiated treatment at the WTO. These priorities depend very much on the willingness of the European Union to give its full weight within the WTO to facilitating improvement in the rules in terms of development priorities. Finally, stating a wish is no use without the means to achieve it. I should like to conclude by saying that, beyond the concern about the European Union’s financial perspectives, we must, on the one hand, keep the promises made by the President of the Commission at Gleneagles concerning aid for trade. On the other hand, we must envisage new financial commitments to compensate for the cost, to the ACP countries, of the removal of preferences and customs tariffs, strengthen technical support to ACP countries and, finally, ladies and gentlemen, reject the unacceptable reduction in the European Development Fund. Since, however, I am not convinced that these aims will be achieved quickly, I suggest that, where the reciprocal opening of markets is concerned, the Commission consider, as a token of its goodwill, prolonging the period of transition according to the specific needs of the ACP countries, as defined at the time of the negotiations.

Mr President, Commissioner, ever since the quota system was abolished last year, imports from China have, as has been mentioned, spectacularly increased by around 500%. That has serious consequences for the competitiveness of the European footwear sector which, faced with this flood of very low-priced imports, is seeing a number of tragic bankruptcies, to say nothing of the job losses that go with them. Furthermore, our traditional suppliers in the form of candidate countries and countries in the Euromed area have been ousted from the Community market. The Commission remains silent on this matter and does not seem keen to assess the impact of the damage done by this liberalisation. Following the complaint lodged by the operators in this sector, you opened an antidumping inquiry. The alarming results of that inquiry bring to light unquestionable evidence of state intervention and of social dumping practices, which cause material loss to our industries. In order to combat this distortion of the fundamental rules of international trade, you are proposing some measures to us today. I am worried, however, about the gradual entry into force of these antidumping laws over a five-month period, a precedent that I feel is inappropriate and legally questionable and will not be without pernicious effects. These laws should make it possible to eliminate either dumping or the losses it causes. In fact, the proposed progressive rates do not fulfil either of those two alternative conditions. What is more, the exclusion of children’s shoes seems to me to be unjustified and incomprehensible. Your proposals could very quickly prove to be insufficient faced with the extent of the losses suffered by our businesses. Other initiatives could be taken to counter these unfair commercial practices. For example, it would be possible to open an inquiry in the framework of the provisional safeguard measures applicable to Chinese imports, measures that have the advantage of being simple and effective. If the Member States asked you to take such initiatives, would the Commission envisage doing so? Might consideration be given, Commissioner, to assessing whether China is actually implementing WTO trade rules and complying with fair and equitable commercial practices, unlike the way in which it is patently violating WTO law? Your proposals are neither robust nor enlightened. After textiles last year and footwear now, which other sectors will have to be subjected to these unfair practices in the future?

With our European ports featuring among the most modern and most competitive in the world, I fail to understand the need for a directive aimed at liberalising port services in Europe. I also fail to understand the Commission’s obstinacy in wanting to impose a law that the shipowners, the managers of European ports and, above all, the dockworkers find unsatisfactory. This is stubbornness verging on a denial of democracy, when it becomes clear that the Commission is daring to trot out the same proposal already rejected by Members of this Parliament. By introducing self-handling, this text threatens not only the jobs of thousands of workers in European ports but also the safety and security of goods and persons, because these workers are made to compete against crews who are employed on a casual basis and who often have no professional qualifications. By voting against this iniquitous text, I therefore wanted to assure those who champion the survival of their profession that they have my support. I call on the Commission finally to get down to work in order to ensure a high employment rate and upwards social harmonisation, instead of engaging in the systematic and shameless dismantling of our fellow citizens’ social benefits, coupled with unrestrained social dumping.

 Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, as has just been pointed out, our debate today concerns the regulation to put in place a mechanism for countries that are unable to produce the medicines that are essential for the public health of their citizens. The fact that we are dealing with this question on the eve of World Aids Day should encourage us to send a loud and clear message to those countries so tragically affected. UN Aids again reminded us very recently of the sad reality that the world has never before had so many people who are carriers of HIV. The number of persons infected passed the 40 million mark this year and Sub-Saharan Africa is the most severely affected with two thirds of the world’s sufferers and three quarters of the world’s infected women. It has been clear from the outset that Parliament has one priority, namely the rapid implementation of the regulation in question, so that countries in need can benefit from the flexibility offered by the WTO’s 30 August 2003 solution as soon as possible. This is a first step in the European Union’s compliance with the spirit of the Doha Declaration on TRIPS and public health. I would like to thank my colleague Mr Van Hecke warmly for the work he has done in consultation and collaboration with the counter rapporteurs. He appears before us today with a compromise that manages to take account of Members’ positions: it is a responsible stance. Several of our demands appear in the final text, in particular the widening of the scope to the least developed countries and certain developing countries that are not members of the WTO. In view of the vital role that NGOs and certain international organisations play in the supply of health services and treatments, I am glad that they will be allowed to deal with patent holders directly in order to buy and distribute generic medicines. I am also pleased to see that my proposal for a simplified procedure for additional quantities has been adopted. There are many positive points. I do have a number of regrets, however, especially regarding the appropriate remuneration to be paid to patent holders. I would have liked the rapporteur’s proposed 4% ceiling to be mandatory in all situations and not only in emergencies. We have nevertheless succeeded in getting the fact that the compulsory licence is issued for humanitarian and not for commercial reasons taken into account when that remuneration is calculated. I also hope that this regulation will be evaluated quickly and its viability assessed. In view of the complexity of the mechanism it seeks to deploy, I shall remain vigilant to see that this solution is permanently included in the WTO intellectual property rules. Indeed, only such an evaluation will enable us to draw adequate conclusions for effectively revising and adapting our response to the public health problems encountered by the countries of the South. Meeting the challenge of access to medicines requires a more global approach and the regulation we are discussing today is only one stage in that. Within the WTO, Europe must commit itself to ensuring that all the Doha Agreement’s public health advances are translated into reality. This means in particular ensuring that no bilateral or regional trade agreements include additional conditions on intellectual property that would undo the gains of the Doha Declaration. Moreover, if application of that declaration leaves something to be desired in practice, the EU must also try to find new ways to give the developing countries easier access to medicines. Even now, we are faced with the need for second-line treatments, for which no generics are yet available and the price of which is prohibitive, requiring renewed action on our part. The fight against Aids and, I must stress, many other diseases afflicting mainly the poorest populations is far from being won. The forthcoming WTO conference in Hong Kong gives us an ideal opportunity to bring the question of access to medicines back to the centre of the debate. Adopting this regulation today offers us a first definite solution for thousands of sick people who are waiting for treatment, but let us not forget, when tomorrow comes, to seek lasting solutions equal to the scale of the challenge that faces us.

Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, I should like to thank our fellow Member, Mr Brejc, for his report. It is timely, with only a few weeks to go until the opening of the WTO Ministerial Meeting in Hong Kong. The form of globalisation that we know today has always been presented to us as a positive phenomenon that creates wealth. It certainly has its winners but - to plagiarise the former Prime Minister of France - globalisation is a new aristocracy of money and power, which today accumulates profits and relegates a majority of losers to the sidelines. We are not only noticing an increase in the inequalities in North-South relations, but we are also discovering that these inequalities are reflected today in South-South relations and within the very heart of a Western society in which the gap between the richest and the poorest has become dramatically more pronounced over the last few years. The pursuit of social globalisation has the effect of endangering social rights and creating disgraceful working practices and dangerous imbalances. This new situation forces us no longer to view the world with the same detachment. We have to take note of the fact that this process of liberal, non-transparent and unfettered globalisation is of concern to our fellow citizens. Yet, who can hold it against them if they are afraid for their jobs, their future, their democracy and the environment of the planet on which they live? No one. For what have we done to respond to these legitimate anxieties? If I were to take the most recent example, that of the last UN Summit in New York, the results were disappointing. They were disappointing in terms both of the concrete commitments made towards the poorest countries and of the reform of the international institutions. Europe has to act in a coherent and credible fashion. Doing so at multilateral level is exemplary behaviour. That is why incorporating strict social and environmental standards into the rules of trade and checking that these standards are upheld in the bilateral agreements we sign, are priorities. Europe also has to act as an example internally. To do that, it has to improve its model, put in place a system of upwards social harmonisation, put a stop to the dismantling of public services and reject a market Europe. Europe provides an opportunity and a hope. It has to be the main actor in a different form of globalisation.

 Madam President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, I would like to start by congratulating Mrs Jäätteenmäki on her report on the Barcelona process revisited. I would now like to turn to my proposal. Next month, the European Heads of State or Government will meet their Mediterranean counterparts to celebrate the 10th anniversary of the Barcelona process. The Euro-Mediterranean Partnership was intended to provide the ambitious prospect of a better, varied future, simultaneously political, economic, social and cultural. The results, 10 years on, are mixed. We have created a forum for discussion and cooperation with our Mediterranean neighbours, which I welcome, but we are far from achieving all the objectives set. The conflict in the Middle East has not been resolved. The region is still unstable. Human rights and democratisation are not progressing, or are not progressing enough. The southern shore of the Mediterranean and its population have not benefited from the expected economic and social well-being. Unemployment, particularly among young people, is still too high and results in hopeless migration flows. On the economic front, I will mention just one example: the end of the Multifibre Agreement, which has added to the difficulties experienced by the region. Although the new rules of cumulative origin, as proposed by Commissioner Mandelson, are moving in the right direction, South-South economic integration is still far from complete. We are the privileged partner of this region and all its hopes are turned towards us. Caring about these people primarily means responding to their concerns and their aspirations, in other words our ability to achieve greater social cohesion and sustainable economic development. The new Neighbourhood Policy proposed to us is a positive element, because it calls for greater democracy, even though the aid will have to be shared more broadly amongst our neighbours to the east and to the south. I hope that this new policy will pursue the objectives of the Barcelona process and that it will take account of the difficulties specific to this region. I am also concerned by the absence, in the neighbourhood and partnership instrument as proposed by the Commission, of a specific reference to the Millennium Goals. In the global environment in which we live, liberalisation cannot be the answer to the problems raised. That applies to the protection of our environment – given that we are responsible for our planet – but, even more acutely, to the issue of public services that meet the basic needs of the people, namely education, health, culture, and access to water and power, which the Committee on International Trade, of which I am a member, proposed and which the Committee on Foreign Affairs did not adopt. We agree with the view that our work is not yet done. Let us be in agreement tomorrow to achieve a common goal.

Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, Mr Michel is proposing to us today a strategic partnership between the European Union and Africa. This is a fresh opportunity for us to respond to the basic needs of the African continent. A few weeks ago, the Heads of State or Government met in New York. Back then there were showy declarations and strong pledges of good will, and hope was in the air. Yet, the results were insignificant. The Millennium Development Goals will not be achieved, and Africa is, once again, the big loser in all of this. The desperate situation in Africa has recently been illustrated by images on our television screens: images of men prepared to die on the barbed fencing of our continent in order to gain better prospects and a future for themselves and their children, as well as for their country and their continent. We are all aware that, in order to help Africa overcome poverty, war, hunger and violence, a process and financial resources must be put in place. We have known what our responsibilities are for a long time. The European Union has a long tradition of promoting development in the African continent, but the results have generally fallen short of the mark. You have declared, Commissioner, that your plan would attempt to strike a balance between social objectives and economic development. I am not one of those people who believe that economic liberalisation automatically leads to social progress and, while we are on that subject, I am concerned about the free trade agreements with the ACP countries. I believe that our investments need to be focused primarily on education, training, research, health care and public services. We must – and I believe that this is one of your priorities – make sure that the funds are used and distributed more effectively, that there is better governance and, in fact, that transparent and peaceful democracies are established. I have faith, Commissioner, in your political will. I would, however, like you to clarify a few points for us. How do you intend to deal with the diversity of the African countries? More specifically, what is the link between this general plan and various partnerships already in existence? How should we deal with the debt issue, since, in my opinion, this aspect is not sufficiently addressed in the plan? In short, what practical implementation will take place and what resources will be allocated to this strategy?

Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I would like first of all, as has been done previously, to congratulate my fellow Member, Mr Bowis, on his excellent report on major and neglected diseases, which is both comprehensive and balanced. On the eve of the United Nations Summit in New York, where the Millennium Goals will be at the centre of debate, this report forms part of a highly topical subject area. It is pointless to remind you that we already know that these goals will not be achieved in the timeframe that we had set ourselves and that they are about to be added to the list of promises broken by the rich nations. As three out of eight of the principal Millennium Goals concern health care issues, the work of my fellow Member, Mr Bowis, should ensure there is a greater level of awareness of this reality. In addition to showing the necessary awareness of the situation, I would like the European Parliament to deliver a strong and clear message to the Member States to revive the goals. The health care issues that the poorest countries must face fuel the spiral of their under development. The observation is simple; those who today have most need of treatments do not have access to them. Why? Either because they are expensive or because fundamental research and the development of research are inadequate, indeed non-existent, for certain major and neglected diseases. Furthermore, when these drugs do exist and are affordable, the populations in some cases do not have access to them, as they are not adapted to the particular sanitation conditions in these countries. The problem is more serious and of a structural nature; while the fundamental research is mainly carried out by the public sector, the development of these drugs is almost entirely in the hands of the private sector. Without a guarantee of profits, the pharmaceutical industry has no interest at all in investing in the development of new molecules. Any innovation is therefore dependent on obtaining highly profitable patents. It is therefore practically impossible for populations with weak purchasing power, the vast majority of whom come from the countries targeted by the Millennium Goals, to obtain these drugs, which are vital nonetheless. This logic also leads to prices being fixed at an artificially high level. In the era of globalisation, ladies and gentlemen, the health of each person must be the responsibility of all. As regards drugs, it is needs that must dictate our strategy for action to deal with the worldwide issue of health and development. Furthermore, we must also encourage and support developing countries so that they might devote a minimum of 20% of their budgets to health care policies, policies of investment in research and development or policies for adapting intellectual property rules. These countries’ financial resources are, therefore, insufficient on their own. There can be no progress in today’s world as regards the major challenge of health care without a shared commitment from the public authorities and the private sector. The pharmaceutical industry must emerge from an exclusively profit-making mind-set and revise its commitments and its priorities, in particular in the research and development sector but also in the marketing sector. As for the public authorities, they must lay down legal frameworks, set objectives and offer perspectives that guarantee the common good while respecting the interests of each person. I therefore draw the attention of the Council and of the Commission to the need to take initiatives: to draft a new international treaty on research and development in medicine, to include within the seventh European Union Research Framework Programme a specific reference to research and development for neglected diseases, which would be guaranteed funding, to ensure that the Doha Declaration on compulsory licences is not challenged by bilateral trade agreements, and, finally, to encourage the swift entry into force of the Community regulation, currently being debated by Parliament and the Council, enabling the generic medicines industry to produce treatments that will prevent health care disasters with tragic repercussions for a large part of our planet.

Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, since its launch, the WTO has been heavily criticised. Today, on the occasion of the 10th anniversary of this organisation, we could take stock and ask the following question: do we need the WTO? In the context of the relentless growth of globalisation, we unquestionably have no option but to acknowledge our need for a multilateral organisation. To the other question, ‘do we need this organisation the way it is currently run?’, however, my response would be far more cautious. Indeed today, the world is still not managing to distribute its wealth in a balanced way. Trade has a significant role to play in creating this balance, but its existing rules have until now remained largely indifferent to the demands and needs of a large part of the planet. Faced with this observation, I sometimes harbour the naive hope that the Hong Kong Conference, which will take place at the end of the year, will alter this undeniable fact and will, above all, finally fulfil the hopes raised by the launch of the Doha Development Programme. Last month, on 10 and 16 April, hundreds of NGOs and associations made their voices heard throughout the world in support of fairer trade. I share their opinion that trade based on the sole and simplistic principle of casual laisser-faire
 will not result in greater distribution of wealth; quite the opposite. Our priority must be to reorient international trade in order to equip it with a genuine economic and social justice dimension. If we really hope to help the poorer countries to benefit from globalisation, we must re-evaluate all world trade rules in a more equitable manner, by considering the link between trade and sustainable development. In my opinion, members of the WTO should therefore include these principles amongst their objectives, but above all they should draw on the outcome of the practices and the rules enacted so that they are then in a position to adapt the policies conducted in a more fair and equitable way. I also hope for a transparent WTO, and a credible and legitimate organisation, whose decisions could be upheld by its members and civil society. As a European Member of Parliament elected by European citizens, I can only state, and above all regret, the current lack of information of which I have fallen foul, to enable me to satisfactorily carry out my democratic control function. Yet more regrettable is that we, as European Members, have no say in the Commission’s negotiation mandate. The same applies, however, to our future. Whilst I am anxious about the consequences and repercussions of the Directive on services for our European public services, I am easily annoyed when faced with incidences of the liberalisation of services at international level, which could threaten – often public – services linked to citizens’ basic needs in countries that often have the most urgent need of them. If we are widely agreed that services linked to healthcare, education, and cultural and audiovisual sectors have exceptional status in the negotiations, we must not, however, forget the services that relate to basic needs such as water and energy, since we cannot call on developing countries to liberalise these services when this would lead to their being dismantled. I should like to point out that we made a commitment in New York, in 2000, in support of the eight Millennium Development Objectives. These development objectives cannot be dissociated from the Doha Development Programme and the negotiations taking place. We cannot make promises one day and then quickly forget them the next. The case of the Philippines is one example amongst many others of the harmful effects of liberalising water distribution services. In fact, following the liberalisation of this service in 1997, the price of water not only increased by 600%, but the very quality of the water also dropped to such a degree that it today causes illness. I am most fearful that, by the year 2015, we will not succeed in halving the percentage of the population that lacks permanent access to water. If we cannot have access to water, we cannot live.

Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I would first of all like to congratulate our rapporteur Mr Antolin Sánchez Presedo on his excellent work, which aims at greater transparency, clarity and above all efficiency in the generalised system of preferences. I would also like to highlight the considerable steps forward made in this new regulation, not only in terms of simplification, with the reduction in the number of systems, while concentrating the benefits of the GSP in the countries that need them most, or in terms of encouraging compliance with practices that are in line with sustainable development and good governance, but also in terms of the quick adoption of the new regulation, in order to provide additional commercial support as soon as possible for the countries affected by the tsunami. On this last point, I am, however, concerned about the capacity of the beneficiary countries, and particularly those affected by the tidal wave, to take the necessary administrative steps quickly in order to benefit from the new system. Will the Commission have enough time to correctly evaluate the needs of the countries concerned? I think that the rapporteur’s proposal of a transitional period until January 2006 is the most reasonable, especially as we know that these long and complex procedures have always limited the use of the scheme by poor countries. Also, with regard to rules of origin, although I welcome the greater flexibility in the text, it should be a priority for the European Union to harmonise these rules at international level, in particular within the WTO. Developing countries have to adapt to the specific rules of origin of each country that grants them a system of preferences, which makes the process very complicated and costly, to the point that sometimes it loses all commercial value. I would also like to stress that Parliament asks the Commission to closely monitor the application of the new system, in order to determine whether it achieves its objectives, country by country. The Commission needs to evaluate the system regularly, monitor its implementation and keep Parliament informed, which was not done in the past. I would like to finish by saying that the GSP is not an instrument that can promote development in the poorest countries and their full integration into international trade. If we really want to help poor countries to benefit from globalisation, we need to rethink world trade rules as a whole so that they are fairer, linking trade with sustainable development.

 Mr President, I am delighted that we are holding a debate on the issue of hunger and poverty. I am one among many to say so, but I cannot help but be pleased. This debate also follows on from the initiative launched by the Quintet last September at the United Nations. Since then, many other voices have been heard on the same subject. Nevertheless, I would remind you that no specific commitments have yet been made. Only four of the Member States of the European Union are currently meeting the commitment to devote 0.7% of their GDP to development aid. At the rate things are going, the Millennium Development Goals will not be reached in 2015. The problem of ending hunger and poverty is as old as the solutions being put forward to solve it: increasing the quality and quantity of development aid, cancelling and reducing debt, instituting a global tax on capital flows, and reforming international trade rules for fairer trade. In addition, all of the initiatives being put forward today must be in the form of additional resources devoted to development aid and can under no circumstances replace long-standing commitments. Myself, I will be keeping a close eye on these commitments and on this resolution, because only a firm political will can bring an end to this scourge. Hunger and poverty cannot be reduced to an ephemeral debate subject to the ups and downs of opportunistic media promotion or of charity, however well intentioned.

 Mr President, Commission President, ladies and gentlemen, some of us were in Porto Alegre a few days ago, either as part of our national responsibilities or, in my opinion more importantly, as part of the World Parliamentary Forum. I would therefore firstly like to thank my fellow Members who were in Porto Alegre, and in particular my colleague Harlem Désir, for the work they have done over many years to enable Europe to take part in this large-scale civic meeting. Many commentators and participants shared the fear that this movement would run out of steam, but that has not been the case. The anti-globalisation movement has been able to redirect its activities and to define a new organisational method that has resulted in the World Social Forum being no longer just a platform for demands but also a platform for proposals. Moreover, the fact that the Davos Economic Forum discussed some of the subjects brought up in the world social forums proves that the questions asked there are ones that ask us all what sort of world we want. Neither the World Social Forum nor the World Economic Forum in Davos, however, is a political actor that can, on its own, turn demands into political decisions. That is why a body like the European Parliament is duty-bound to pass on and lend powerful support to a number of initiatives, such as cancelling the debt of poor countries, increasing and improving public development aid, instituting a global tax, reforming international trade rules, combating tax evasion and tax havens and defending public services. A number of Heads of State or Government have already taken initiatives, and other proposals will need to be put forward at the G8 summit. In this year, 2005, in which we will make an interim assessment of the implementation of the Millennium Objectives launched by the United Nations, these are all positive moves, provided they are not just more empty promises. That is why more than 100 organisations, NGOs, associations and trade unions will run a mobilisation and questioning campaign at global and European level this year. This campaign will speak out on the subjects of trade and poverty, in particular, and one of the first of its many initiatives will be a global action week for fairer trade next April. We already know that, at the rate things are going, the Millennium Goals will not be achieved. It is therefore down to us to keep the promises made by others a long time ago, by supporting these initiatives and this global anti-poverty campaign in order to emphasise and demonstrate our desire for a better distribution of wealth, in a democratic and peaceful world. Politicians have let people down in the past. They may well do so in the future, but under no circumstances must they abandon the idea that they themselves have to fight for a fairer world, and translate this idea into action.

 Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I must begin, as other Members of this House before me have done, by thanking Mr Eurlings for the balanced report that he has presented to us today. It is a report that, moreover, gives continuity to what was previously proposed by Mr Verheugen. Like most of you, I have been witnessing for some time now a semantic debate between accession and privileged partnership. I am somewhat surprised by this debate, but it merely typifies the irrational and subjective nature of our relationship with Turkey. To my mind, the only questions that need to be asked are: ‘What have we done in the past?’ and ‘What must we do in the future?’ For more than 40 years now, European politicians from all sides and from all countries have been saying that Turkey belongs in Europe and that such continuity is a source of pride for both them and us. There are those who feel, however, that, at the end of this long engagement, marriage is no longer on the agenda. The planned process is long, difficult and demanding, however, and requires responsibility and prudence; as such, Turkey has an obligation to provide us with the guarantees needed for accession to take place. The natural consequence, however, of the demands that we are making is accession. A privileged partnership will not encourage Turkey to accept such demands. We must firstly, therefore, be consistent with ourselves and with our previous commitments, so that everyone is treated equally. As a non-religious person, I have no intention of upsetting any religion or creed. When the world speaks of the ‘clash of civilisations’, when the Bush Administration pits the forces of evil against the forces of good, when Muslim fundamentalists use any excuse to give sermons carrying a message of violence and exclusion, it would be dangerous for Europe to be swept along that route and to endorse such thinking. Furthermore, I should like to reiterate all of the demands on women’s rights, union rights, human rights and the recognition of minorities, to which I would add the Armenian question and the recognition of the Republic of Cyprus. Nevertheless, raising those questions, crucially important though they may be to a Europe of values, cannot be a prerequisite for opening negotiations. As a committed and progressive citizen, I do not see a world frozen in time, in which the situation as it is today would, as a matter of course, be the same in ten or fifteen years’ time. Such a view of politics does a disservice to the way in which human beings and societies evolve and to people’s intelligence and ability to live together. As regards the positive developments in Turkey in recent years, which have been driven by the will of the people, it would be a serious mistake to reject the opening of these negotiations. As a federalist, I sometimes hope, I sometimes dream, of a politically-integrated Europe. The notion of a privileged partnership would be no more than a commercial super-partnership, which would be a triumph for ‘living alongside’ over ‘living together’ – the business-based concept of an unjust world. I personally hope ... (The President cut off the speaker.)

 Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, I very much want, first of all, to thank those MEPs who, in the last part-session, refused to place their confidence in the Commission proposed by you, Mr Barroso, for it in no way corresponded to the values of tolerance, solidarity and transparency that should characterise the European Union. Since then, you have made a clever strategic withdrawal, but in no respect have you abandoned those values of yours that you also put into practice in Portugal, in both the social and foreign policy spheres. You now want to make a political victory out of this tactical manoeuvre. This seems to me to imply a lack of respect for ourselves as MEPs. You have made some slight modifications, voluntarily or otherwise. We take due note of these, but in no way are they enough. Mr Buttiglione was the scapegoat. By sacrificing him, you thought you had succeeded in making us forget the rest of the Commission. You erected a smokescreen which cannot make us accept, in particular, a competition Commissioner who, in the kind of phrase already used, you will find is a fly in the ointment until the end of your term of office. With regard to what you are proposing to us, I know that you have not gone back on your intentions and that, to mention just two areas, the social dimension and public services are not really your Commission’s priorities. You are asking us, however, to think again and to accord you a majority such as no other President of the Commission before you has been able to enjoy. That would be an incredible turnaround, Mr Barroso, but also an incredible instance of your turning your back on us as MEPs. Parliament’s new, pride-inducing legitimacy as something more than a simple recording chamber or rump parliament cannot now be called into question by clever presentation and a certain talent for oratory. There is always a link between a programme and the personalities who implement it. That is why, as a French socialist, I can only express defiance regarding the Commission you are proposing to us. In order to remain faithful to my values, consistent in my choices and concerned to see Parliament respected, I shall not vote in favour of your Commission.

Mr President, Commissioner, every year around this time, as we have just seen, another debate is held on the subject of forest fires. Fortunately, and even though the effects of fires continue to be too serious and disastrous, the fires which have affected, in particular, the southern Member States of the EU this year have been less fierce, and there has been no summer heatwave causing thousands of deaths. In 2002, the European Union set up a Solidarity Fund intended to deal with natural disasters of this kind and their consequences for our peoples. Last year, this Fund helped to deal with the aftermath of the fires in southern Europe. In late 2003, the Forest Focus Regulation was adopted, but it was allocated only EUR 9 million of funding for the 2003-2006 period, which is not enough to prevent fires. In the long run, there are plans for cofinancing via the common agricultural policy and the rural development fund, which means a partial withdrawal from the EU’s forestry policy. What image of solidarity do we wish to present to our fellow citizens, especially those from the South? A further problem facing us is the role of forests in the implementation of the Kyoto Protocol. Not only do forest fires contribute to climate change as a result of massive CO2 emissions, they also gradually reduce the size of our forests and the Union’s carbon sink capacities. We continue, and rightly so, to express our dismay at the fires and other natural disasters which have affected all of Europe over the past few years. We cannot, however, show our solidarity with words alone. Words are never enough. Action is necessary and must be taken to greatly reduce the scale of forest fires and of other natural disasters. Ladies and gentlemen, this is a matter of urgency: we must reduce these disasters and show our solidarity.

For years now, alongside our African colleagues, we the socialists have joined forces to make the EPAs real development instruments. We have negotiated strongly and determinedly with the Commission to obtain fair agreements that promote the Millennium Development Goals. We have done so by opting for selective regionalisation conducted by the ACPs themselves. We have done so by fulfilling our commitments in relation to the trade-related assistance pledged in 2005, rather than by ‘pillaging’ the EDF. Today our fight has largely borne fruit, since the Trade Commissioner has made a commitment on behalf of the European Commission in relation to: – the crucial objective of developing the agreements, – the renegotiation of the contentious points of the agreements on the basis of an open and flexible approach, – food security and the protection of the fragile industries of ACP countries. Obviously we would have liked more guarantees with regard to how the national parliaments and the ACP-EU Assembly will be involved in monitoring the implementation of the agreements. However, the progress made in just a few weeks is considerable. I hereby acknowledge it. I do, however, intend to keep an extremely close eye on its implementation. So there will be no ‘blank cheque’: I abstained.

 The Joint Parliamentary Assembly or JPA has become a key instrument of political dialogue as well as conflict prevention and resolution. In situations of political crisis, our ‘urgent debates’ have enabled in-depth, constructive and taboo-free dialogue on the situation in Kenya, Zimbabwe and Mauritania. On the great North-South ‘horizontal’ challenges, such as food security, effectiveness of state aid, and child labour, in 2008 the JPA adopted constructive, often daring positions. With regard to implementation of the European Development Fund, the JPA got hold of strategic documents that its economic committee has begun to examine. The JPA’s agenda has above all, however, been marked by a single political priority, that of Economic Partnership Agreements or EPAs. Its ‘regional meetings’ represent a major asset and undeniable added value for monitoring EPAs. This added value must now be recognised and honoured. The JPA must be at the heart of the provision of parliamentary control of negotiations and the implementation of agreements. Finally, I would like to pay tribute here to the work of Co-President Glenys Kinnock. She has succeeded in making the JPA a unique tool for North-South dialogue, and an opportunity for fair, sustainable and mutually supportive development.

The Commission is making EPAs the alpha and omega of its development strategy. The Schröder report and the European right are doing the same. Supporting as we do the countries concerned, the European socialists do not endorse this approach. As far as we are concerned, these EPAs are a con. There is still time to promote another way of thinking, to make EPAs real development instruments, by supporting the re-opening of negotiations on the points on which there is most conflict, as Mr Barroso and Mrs Ashton have promised to do; by opting for selective regionalisation, as conducted by the ACP countries themselves; by honouring our commitments concerning the trade-related assistance pledged in 2005 rather than ‘plundering’ the EDF; by guaranteeing real parliamentary control of the process, with the ACP parliaments taking a leading role, and the involvement of the civil societies in the south; and by rejecting the ‘bulldozer strategy’ aimed at extending the negotiations on services and the ‘Singapore’ issues, when the ACP countries are not ready to do so. This is not the ‘road map’ described in the Schröder report. That is why I shall vote against it.

The Horn of Africa is currently suffering from cumulative scourges: - war, both civil and regional, - the absence of democracy and freedom, - famine and the food crisis. The acts of piracy, reminiscent of another age, are only the latest product of this chaos. Faced with these tragedies that are tearing apart the region and spreading bloodshed, we do not have to remain silent or claim impotence. It is now, more than ever, when the international community is showing signs of being fatigued by a seemingly never-ending crisis, that the EU must take a leading role. By launching Operation ‘Atalante’ to protect vulnerable ships and the delivery of food aid to Somali refugees, the Union has demonstrated that it can find real and effective solutions when confronted with an emergency. However, it also has to find responses to the general political crisis in the region. It must construct the ‘EU regional political partnership for peace, security and development in the Horn of Africa’ which the Committee on Development launched when it adopted its report in April 2007. Let us not allow the Horn of Africa to become an area of lawlessness where no development takes place.

 Yes, we have an obligation to help developing countries and, in particular, the least developed countries (LDCs) and the small island developing states (SIDSs) to limit the impact of global warming, as these countries will be the first victims of global warming, without being responsible for it. At present, Africa is the ‘forgotten continent’ of climate negotiation. This ambition must, however, be reflected in a financial commitment commensurate with what is at stake. Therein lies the problem. The budget of EUR 60 million provided for by the European Commission is not enough. The long-term funding objective should be one of at least EUR 2 billion between now and 2010 and of EUR 5 billion to EUR 10 billion between now and 2020. To fund this increase, the Commission and the Member States must use at least 25% of the revenue from the Community’s emissions trading scheme. We are also requesting measures relating to financial aid, technical assistance and technology transfer in order to facilitate the use of low greenhouse gas emissions technologies. Finally, new methods of funding need to be unblocked. If, once again, it is development credits and the European Development Fund that are mobilised, the alliance concerned will be no more than a sham.

Following the shipwrecks of the oil tankers Erika
 and Prestige
, the European Socialists led the fight for ‘high-end’ EU legislation on maritime safety. The seven Third Maritime Safety Package reports are a decision step towards achieving that aim, provided the Council does not empty them of their content. Since the first reading in 2007, the Council has rejected most of Parliament’s recommendations on the other five. At this second reading, and after a great deal of amendment work, Parliament reaffirms the absolute priority it attaches to the creation of a European maritime policy that affords a high level of protection with regard to: - flag state control, - a Community vessel traffic monitoring system, - liability of passenger carriers, - ship inspections and survey organisations, - the designation of an independent competent authority for the accommodation of vessels in distress, - the application of the ‘polluter pays’ principle to the maritime sector. I strongly support this message to the Council. I appeal to Nicolas Sarkozy and Dominique Bussereau to ensure that the French Presidency allows the creation of a maritime area in Europe that can serve as a model for all.

 In 2001 the EU made a big commitment: to devote 0.7% of its wealth to development in 2015. In 2007 Europe turned its back on this commitment, with a drastic fall in its collective effort. This adds up to EUR 1.7 billion that the poorest people of the planet will not have received. EUR 1.7 billion that would have provided healthcare for thousands of children at a time when 11 million people are dying each year owing to a lack of access to healthcare. EUR 1.7 billion that would have provided access to primary education for some of the 114 million children without it. The EU’s primary responsibility when it comes to international solidarity is this: to keep its word. The EU must, however, guarantee the effectiveness of its aid in order to make any real improvement to the situation of the most deprived. The Monterrey Conference of 2002 prepared a roadmap, particularly concerning the end of ‘tied aid’, the acceleration of debt cancellation initiatives and the introduction of innovative finance schemes like the ‘Tobin tax’. Six years on, the EU still has a long way to go. The Doha Conference in a few weeks should enable it to start moving forward again. Half of humanity is counting on it…

 On paper, the fifth of the Millennium Development Goals – which is to reduce maternal mortality by 75% between now and 2015 – was clearly one of the most achievable targets. In fact this was the one that fell most behind schedule. Here is a damning fact: in sub-Saharan Africa one woman in 16 dies in childbirth. This figure has hardly changed in 20 years. Where else on the planet could you find such a dramatic imbalance as this in the area of human health? What is more, when the mother dies the child is 10 times more likely to die too. In our all-out efforts to achieve the MDGs we therefore need to pay special attention to number 5. The G8 itself has finally got the message. At its last meeting in Japan it adopted a ‘health package’ aimed at recruiting and training 1 million health professionals for Africa so that 80% of mothers will have support during childbirth. The ball is now in the EU’s court. The Community needs to act simultaneously and with real substance in several directions: - information and education for women, - strengthening of public health systems in the countries of the south, - massive investment in human resources in the area of health care.

 Like people all over the world, Zimbabweans want peace, democracy and prosperity. Under Robert Mugabe, they have none of this. A former liberator of the country, he is now its torturer. Today, Parliament is sending out a clear message: it no longer wants Mugabe and his regime. The people of Zimbabwe have decided this. The EU must bring all of its weight to bear in order to help Zimbabweans and Africans find a solution to the crisis. The priority is to put an end to the violence. Only a dialogue open to all members of Zimbabwean society will allow a transitional regime to be established, with a clear mandate for the organisation of free and transparent elections monitored by the international community. However, Robert Mugabe will not come to the negotiating table unless forced to do so. This is why we must strengthen our arsenal of sanctions against the regime. Finally, we need to plan now for the reconstruction of a future Zimbabwe: I welcome the Commission’s proposal to release EUR 250 million in emergency funding as soon as Zimbabwe has a legitimate and credible government.

 Mr President, I should first of all like to congratulate Mr Hutchinson on his excellent report. In 2007 we had confirmation of both the rise and relevance of the role of the JPA on the principal challenges of the North-South dialogue. Regarding political crisis situations, for example, our urgent debates have allowed an in-depth constructive dialogue free from taboo on issues such as Haiti, Zimbabwe and Ethiopia. The introduction of the JPA regional meetings, the first of which may have been in Namibia, I believe, will help to further deepen this political dialogue. On the implementation of the EDF, Country and Regional Strategy Papers have been submitted to ACP governments since the end of 2007. The JPA must now adopt a strategy and a working method to guarantee the best follow-up and supervision of the use of these funds. On the Economic Partnership Agreements (EPAs), through its discussions and meetings with economic leaders and members of civil society, through its open political dialogue with our parliamentary colleagues in the South, the JPA made EPAs a political priority in 2007. The Kigali Declaration, which Mr Hutchinson mentioned earlier, is an illustration of this. I am sorry that the European Parliament dismissed this declaration, despite it being negotiated and voted on unanimously by representatives of the various political groups there. It would seem that, for some, a position adopted in Africa is sometimes harder to implement when we get back to Europe. I am also sorry that the European Commission is ignoring the views of ACP MPs within the JPA and that it prefers a bulldozer approach by which it refuses to consider any renegotiation or reorientation of the EPAs. The proposal for the creation of a new parliamentary body under the Caribbean agreement simply adds to the confusion. Finally, I cannot get over the fact that in 2007 Official Development Assistance from the whole of the EU fell for the first time since 2000. It is my belief that in terms of international solidarity, what matters most is keeping our word, and several Member States – including mine – are not keeping theirs. In 2008, the JPA should vigilantly and resolutely continue the fight for EPAs, lobbying for a proper renegotiation of interim agreements – for those who want it – in accordance with the promise made by Commissioner Barroso, and for the 10th EDF, which is now entering its active implementation phase, but which risks seeing its appropriations diverted to finance EPAs. The JPA is a unique forum and a unique tool for North-South dialogue. It is an opportunity for fair, sustainable and joint development. My colleague Mr Hutchinson has already said all of this, and I would like to congratulate him once more.

Madam President, development assistance has been in the headlines in recent days, although unfortunately for all the wrong reasons. In 2007, EU aid fell for the first time since 2000. This is an appalling political message that we are sending out to the countries and peoples of the South, at a time when the most fragile of them are being hit by the food crisis. Parliament supports the Commission, supports you, Commissioner, in reiterating the commitment of the EU at the European Summit in Brussels and insisting on a tight schedule. We have a twofold responsibility in terms of international solidarity: first, keeping our word, and second, the guarantee that our aid will make a tangible and effective contribution towards combating poverty. This is what is at stake in the implementation of the 10th
 EDF and almost EUR 22.7 billion over the next six years. I believe that the EU has a major weapon here for tackling poverty and building a fairer world. This is why we are extremely concerned by the delays in the ratification process. Granted, the Commission has committed to the continuity of funding, at least temporarily, but the situation could very quickly become untenable for the most fragile African countries. Our first priority for the 10th
 EDF is democratic scrutiny. Democratic scrutiny of the European Parliament, first of all, with the budgetisation of the EDF – and this time I hope that we will not miss the deadline for the review of the financial perspectives in 2010 – and democratic scrutiny of national parliaments, with a reinforced capacity-building programme. We would also like education and health to be priority action areas and to be allocated 20% of EDF funds. However, there are only plans to grant allocate 6.1% of aid to these areas, and even this figure has fallen compared with the 9th
 EDF. The Commission says that it will achieve the 20% target through budgetary support, and we take it at its word. The report also underlines shortcomings in terms of the gender dimension, which is not currently an area of action in its own right. We need to reopen this debate in consultation with our ACP partners, their parliaments and civil society, during the mid-term review in 2010. As for budgetary support, I personally have always believed that this was a good instrument, provided of course that it respects democracy, good governance and coordination between donors. Since we believe that budgetary support must serve the Millennium Development Goals, we are encouraging the Commission to go down this path with its MDG contracts. For the new incentive tranche proposed in the 10th
 EDF, of course we say yes to a good governance ‘premium’, but no to a governance profile, which would primarily reflect the interests of the North. I would like to talk about the fight against terrorism, immigration, etc. We will also be vigilant on the question of EPA funding. Here too, the EU and the Member States have made a commitment: an additional EUR 2 billion in aid for trade between now and 2010. However, it seems that this EUR 2 billion has melted away and that the Commission is already planning to finance EPAs from integrated regional programmes. It must clarify its intentions on this subject, because EDF funds, as far as we are concerned, should not be used as a reward for signing an EPA. The report makes a number of other points, although I do not have time to go into these. I will just mention two others before finishing. Firstly, the African Peace Facility. Obviously we must support the efforts of the African Union for peace and the prevention of conflict on the continent, but I believe that this instrument comes under the CFSP, and so must be financed from CFSP funds. In terms of co-financing, the report calls for an initial tangible application, i.e. the creation of a ‘pan-African development fund’, jointly funded by the EDF and the neighbourhood instrument. This is more or less the content of my report, for better or worse. Mr Michel, you recently said that ‘we are the first generation that can face up to extreme poverty and state with genuine conviction: we have the money, the medicines and the science to end poverty. The question is, do we have the will?’ Well, on this point, Mr Michel, Parliament is right behind you.

Thank you everyone for this debate and for staying so late. Thank you, Commissioner. I would like to say that, on official development assistance, Parliament is right behind you. I read your comments in the press; I know that it took courage to say certain things. However, I would like to go back to two points. Firstly, the incentive tranche. As you know, a great deal of uncertainty surrounds this instrument. The decision-making process is not very clear. There is no scrutiny and no information for the European Parliament or the JPA, or for national parliaments, and as I said earlier, there are certain criteria in the governance profiles which cause us a problem. I will not repeat myself, but I think that this ambiguity would only be removed by only external control outside the Commission, i.e. scrutiny by the European Parliament, by national parliaments and by the JPA of how and under what conditions the incentive tranche is paid. I also think that this scrutiny should explicitly form part of the implementation of the EDF. On regional integration and the EPAs, personally I think that EPA financing must be additional to EDF funding. I heard what you said about this. However, we need clarification regarding the division of funds, integrated regional programmes, between regions and between ACP countries. We believe you when you say that there is no new conditionality, but we need this type of assurance and precision. In any case, thank you very much for staying so late. (Applause)

 Madam President, Africa and Europe talked politics in Lisbon at the highest level, and this is very good news. Having said that, I would like to be sure they are speaking the same language, and particularly on three major issues. First of all, a partnership of equals. Alpha Konaré told the forum that Africa does not need either charity or paternalism. The Lisbon Declaration confirms this: we will be setting up a partnership of equals. Europe, however, has often treated this commitment rather lightly or à la carte
 by imposing its own agenda whenever its interests were at stake: on terrorism, migration and, at the present time, economic partnership agreements. Secondly, a partnership of peoples. We also expect some action on this issue. The new partnership must bring together civil societies much more systematically, and also the people’s representatives, in other words the parliaments, especially by assisting with the capacities of African parliaments. This is the message conveyed by the common statement made by the European Parliament and the Pan-African Parliament, and I hope this message will be heard. Lastly, in relation to migration: Europeans and Africans had the chance in Lisbon to send a clear political signal which would have placed human rights centre stage in our partnership. I truly believe that Lisbon was, regrettably, a missed opportunity. The new strategy still places the emphasis on protecting borders rather than on the rights of migrants. This means Europe can continue to flout the rights of migrants either here or there, for it has actually made very few commitments in its ‘Migration, Mobility and Employment’ action plan.

 Madam President, the Africa of today has two faces: first there is the one of extreme poverty and human tragedy, as in the case of Darfur and Somalia, and then there is the other face, which is all too often ignored, of a continent that in spite of everything is innovating, that is becoming more democratic, although too slowly, and that little by little is returning to the path of growth. The new EU-Africa strategy therefore needs to take this dual reality into account and support this still fragile process by means of a genuine political partnership: one that is based on unity, for it is Africa in its entirety, through the voice of the African Union, that has to be our main point of contact; on equity with an agenda that has been drawn up together and not imposed by the North, and on humility, for Europe is not the one and only partner Africa has. The EU must also support the process by using the Millennium Development Goals as a roadmap, by keeping to its promises and meeting the financial commitments made by the EU and by the Member States and, finally, by recognising the role played by the African parliaments. The Martens report is in fact the message that we are sending today to the Commission and the Council, and we shall be in Lisbon in December to see if this message has actually got through.

I welcome the European Parliament’s commitment to the deployment of a European force in Chad and the Central African Republic, in order to put an end to violence against the civilian populations there and to create conditions for the voluntary return of the hundreds of thousands of refugees and displaced persons. Already, the Darfur conflict is spilling across national borders, but, with the deployment of the mixed United Nations and African Union force in the days ahead, it could become impossible to halt the infectious spread of violence in the neighbouring countries. That is why the European force is crucial to the overall scheme for restoring security and promoting reconciliation in the region. It will achieve its aims, however, only if all the parties to the conflict ‘play the game’ of peacemaking. This calls for observance of at least two conditions, on which I sought to insist in the drafting of the resolution. Firstly, the force should be absolutely neutral and impartial. Secondly, its internal composition should be balanced: France must not try to play the role of puppet master – and Nicolas Sarkozy’s attitude is not reassuring on that score. With the other French Socialist Members of the House, I shall be particularly vigilant to ensure that the interests of Africa and Europe take priority in the territory for which France is responsible.

 As part of the reform of the common market organisation for sugar, the European Union wanted to help refineries adapt to the restructuring of the European sugar industry by granting EUR 150 million in ‘transitional aid’. I was delighted with this initiative, which among other things should help the Saint-Louis Sucre refinery in Marseille meet the new conditions on the sugar market without resorting to job cuts. However, I also alerted the competent French and European authorities to the lack of transparency in the criteria for allocating this aid, which is the responsibility of the Member States. Currently, this aid is not granted with the intention of maintaining the refining industry or preserving jobs. Neither is there any guarantee that this aid will not be used as an ‘incentive to relocate’ to countries outside the EU. The new reform should have been an opportunity to clarify this point. Regrettably, this has not been the case. The matter is now in the hands of the Council. I am calling for greater vigilance from the Council, particularly of the French authorities, so that this issue, which affects the jobs of our fellow citizens can finally be clarified.

Mr President, I must thank my honourable colleague Thierry Cornillet for his excellent report. He expresses clearly and forcefully the power of work that the Joint Parliamentary Assembly accomplished in 2006. Through the quality of its output, I believe the Assembly has established itself as a pivotal player in the dialogue on North-South cooperation. The Assembly has made its mark by expressing itself forcefully on Darfur in Vienna, by scorning taboos to apportion blame and by proposing a road map designed to end the crisis. It also made its mark by expressing its views on the crucial question of the economic-partnership agreements in Bridgetown. Its message, moreover, was a unanimous declaration that these agreements must remain instruments of development, as Commissioner Michel reaffirmed a short while ago during the previous debate. The political clout of the Joint Assembly will continue to increase over the coming months now that the Commission has undertaken to grant it the right to examine all country and regional strategy papers for the African, Caribbean and Pacific areas and now that the Assembly can convene regional conferences in order to come up with specific responses on major issues such as migration. In view of these new powers – even if they are not really powers – we must take care to ensure that the Assembly has the means to perform its tasks. I wish to say to the Commission and the Commissioner that we shall have to act together to find flexible and effective ways to work jointly on the procedure for the exercise of this new right to examine strategy papers. It is cumbersome, it is difficult, but we must rise to the challenge. I also appeal to the working group on parliamentary reform to take account of the specific characteristics of the Joint Parliamentary Assembly and the constraints affecting it, because, when the parliamentary calendar is compiled these days, some of our commitments clash with the work of the Assembly. Finally, I would like to pay tribute to Mrs Kinnock for the manner in which she has been co-chairing the Assembly.

This report by the European Parliament is a step in the right direction. It makes decent work a tool of European development policy, firstly by cofinancing, with the ILO, a development programme for decent work, and secondly by creating a European label and a blacklist of companies that violate fundamental labour standards, and lastly by implementing trade sanctions against countries that seriously infringe fundamental social rights. It brings about progress for decent work in Europe, where much also remains to be done: by urging the Member States to ratify the ILO conventions on the health and safety of workers, maternity protection and migrant workers; by calling for the introduction of a minimum wage as a safety net to prevent workers from being exploited in any way; by improving access to lifelong learning and by calling for greater harmonisation of pension schemes. These are the foundations of this social Europe that the Socialist Group in the European Parliament wants to build. I shall therefore vote in favour of this report.

Mr President, Commissioner, in its latest proposals, the European Union is considering extending the ‘everything but arms’ concept to all the ACP countries. True, this is an advance that will make it possible to ensure that none of these countries loses out after 2007, but it is not a miracle solution that makes the EPAs development agreements. For them to become development agreements, we need to go much further: we need to provide for a transitional period that is much longer than the 10 or 12 years that are currently being proposed; we need to put an end to agricultural dumping and respect the principle of food sovereignty; we need to offer genuinely special and individual treatment and enable the ACP countries to protect some of their sectors; we need to put a stop to the pressure on the Singapore issues, in order to uphold the right of all States freely to manage their public services; and, finally, we need to involve civil societies and parliaments more. I believe that that is the price to be paid if the EPAs are to serve as a matter of priority the development of Africa, and not just that of Europe.

Shortly after the ‘Erika’ and ‘Prestige’ oil tankers went down, the Socialist Group in the European Parliament led a campaign calling for the EU to provide itself with legislation aimed at enhancing maritime safety and at doing more to prevent accidental pollution in its territorial waters. This campaign has borne fruit, but a genuine European maritime safety area has not fully been created. This ‘third maritime safety package’ is a decisive step towards achieving this objective. The five reports submitted to the European Parliament contain several major advances: - a clear and precise legal framework for places of refuge for ships in distress, under the aegis of an independent authority; - a permanent inspection body, to make inspections easier; - a high level of protection for passengers, in line with that for other modes of transport; - more effective and higher quality controls in European ports, with special attention paid to ‘high-risk’ vessels. I shall therefore vote in favour of these reports. I hope from now on that the EU will also improve its legislation against the ‘hooligans of the sea’, who are responsible in the Mediterranean for ‘daily oil slicks’. There are 650 000 tonnes of oil spills each year as a result of unauthorised degassing, a figure that equates to 75 ‘Erikas’!

Mr President, budget aid has long had a very bad reputation, and it is the failure of the ultraliberal formulas that encompass the structural adjustment plans that has resulted in budget aid now becoming an integral part of the Union’s cooperation policy and in its being enshrined, as you were saying just now, in a European consensus. Budget aid is now regarded as a vital tool in the fight against poverty and in the achievement of the Millennium Development Goals, because it enables the most vulnerable populations to be reached directly and resources to be focused on the crucial sectors of education and basic health care. Furthermore, it also plays a decisive part in rehabilitating States. That is very important, because it is the decline of States and their inability to fulfil their basic public service obligations that is now hindering development, especially in Sub-Saharan Africa. Budget aid provides an incentive for appropriation, that is, the opportunity for the recipient country to choose its own development process, and it is also a precious instrument of political dialogue between donors and beneficiaries and perhaps even of support for parliaments in their role as public finance controller. However, budget aid cannot fulfil its objectives if prior conditions are not met, in particular good governance and the fight against corruption, democracy, respect for fundamental rights and a system for managing public finances that is controlled by a democratically-elected parliament. All of that has been outlined very effectively in the report by my fellow Member, Mr Gahler. However, as the Court of Auditors report revealed, at a time when budget aid really needs clarity, transparency and democracy, it is sometimes a lack of clarity that prevails, because, in several countries – Kenya and Malawi were mentioned – the Commission has used budget aid without the conditions, the proper prior conditions, having been met. It is true that we are now awaiting some very precise answers from the Commission and that we expect it to get right to the bottom of these countries that have been mentioned and to establish control. Like the report, I would recommend a form of external control, instead, either by having the Court of Auditors step in, or by creating a control body in cooperation with the other donors. I believe that, in return for precise monitoring, Parliament will support this new instrument that you have implemented.

 After 30 years of EU-Pacific cooperation, it is now time to move up a gear. That is why I am delighted about the adoption of this ‘strategy for a strengthened partnership’. It entails a strengthening of political dialogue inasmuch as we have to support our Pacific partners in their efforts to overcome ethnic tensions, as in Fiji, or to promote reconciliation after a civil war, as in the Solomon Islands or in Timor Leste. Over the next few years, this political dialogue must also enable us to face a major challenge together: that of global warming. In order to launch this enhanced political dialogue, we can join with our regional partners in organising the ‘regional conferences’ provided for by the new Cotonou Agreement. The strategy involves common responses to the economic and social problems of the region and, here too, the priority is to attain the Millennium Development Goals within the timescales set. The ongoing negotiations on the conclusion of an EU-Pacific regional partnership agreement appear to have got off to a bad start in this respect. Most of the proposals of the countries in the region have been rejected by the Commission. It would be paradoxical to vote today in favour of a strategy for a strengthened partnership aimed at development only to find that, tomorrow, the conclusion of a bad economic partnership agreement emptied it of all content.

Madam President, I would like you to know first of all that I am very happy to see you holding this Presidency. It is rare to see women in that position. The review of the Cotonou Agreement was a significant challenge. We would like to give it real political content by refocusing it on the Millennium objectives and the eradication of poverty. It should be acknowledged, however, that this revision does not entirely live up to its ambitions. Our group has had the opportunity to express its disagreement on several occasions on two points in particular. The first relates to the integration of two commitments into the fundamental values of the agreement: one relating to terrorism, the other to weapons of mass destruction. We are not opposed to them as such, but we feel that the principles of democracy and respect for human rights must remain the main benchmarks of this agreement. My second point relates to the financial dimension. The tenth EDF, which has been the subject of tough negotiations, could not be integrated into the revised agreement. Nevertheless, we are not now proposing that the assent be refused, firstly because progress has been made on many points, such as enhancement of political dialogue, the reference to national parliaments as beneficiaries of aid and support for the International Criminal Court from signatories of the agreement. Secondly, because our ACP partners themselves have accepted the revised agreement and are eager to implement its financial chapter, for which I believe we have obtained a more or less acceptable sum. It is therefore pointless to look back. From now on we have a new battle to wage. We must be certain that every euro genuinely contributes to achieving the development objectives and therefore ensure that the programming of the tenth EDF is better. For example, by setting political objectives that would consist in allocating 20% of the sums to basic education or health in the ACP countries, or by attaching more importance than we currently do to the gender dimension in our development policy. That is the work facing us over the coming weeks, ladies and gentlemen.

This fund is a new tool: for the first time, the EU will no longer come to the aid just of business and local authorities, but indeed directly to that of employees who have lost their jobs because of relocations. This is all the more so because the European Parliament wanted to extend the profits of this fund to ‘small labour markets’ where redundancies have a serious impact on employment and the local economy. This opportunity offers promising prospects to the most vulnerable areas of my region, which is something that I welcome. Equally, I welcome the unwavering commitment of the members of the Socialist Party in the European Parliament, who have taken a strong and tenacious stand in defending the implementation of this tool and tabled many amendments aimed at extending the implementation, amount and number of beneficiaries thereof. This is the first step towards a more social and more united Europe. The EU cannot, however, merely ‘heal the wounds’ of globalisation. Today, Europeans expect Europe to help keep their jobs and their lifestyles secure, in the same way that it has been able to guarantee peace and stability for almost 50 years.

 Mr President, a joint declaration on development, a strategy for Africa, commitments on levels of development aid: the EU has certainly revised its political ambitions upwards in recent years when it comes to development cooperation, and this new financing instrument gives us a tool to match our ambitions. A financing programme over seven years, devoted entirely to international solidarity, really is a great victory for our partners in the South, and it is a great victory for us here in Parliament, because, after two years of locking swords with the Council and the Commission, our main demands have been met. It is a victory in terms of the commitment to allocate at least 20% of appropriations to the education and basic healthcare sectors, in order to increase the pace of progress on the Millennium Goals; it is a victory in terms of the creation of a specific instrument to fund the promotion of human rights and democracy in the countries of the South; and it is a victory in that it limits the scope of the new instrument to the countries of the South alone, in order to ensure that development appropriations are not siphoned off to other policies. Finally, the provision of a mid-term review for this vital instrument will give us the opportunity to rework it shortly and to make any necessary improvements. It is a pleasant prospect, which now allows us to conclude the process of examining this text in peace. These victories will give rise to others, for example the ongoing negotiations on the programming of the European Development Fund (EDF), which I, as rapporteur, will make every effort to give the same priorities. Although it is true that, despite our best efforts, we have not managed to achieve the budgetisation of the EDF or to get officially involved in the comitology procedure, in order to keep a closer eye on the implementation of development policy, we should nevertheless be delighted at our many victories, the most important of which is the promotion of a generous view of development policy. In establishing this development cooperation instrument, the European Union is, more than ever, establishing itself as a leader in this field. It was already by far the biggest donor in the world in this domain, and it was already doing more than the rest of the world for international solidarity. From now on, it will do even better! I believe that, today, Europe can be proud of the fact that it has remained loyal to its values of generosity and solidarity. I, too, would like to echo what has been said, and to thank the rapporteur, Mr Mitchell, all those who have worked towards this result – particularly Mr van den Berg – and all those who have made such valuable contributions to it. I hope that this report will be adopted without amendment.

 Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, this toxic waste affair is certainly criminal – it is as if the South was the North's dustbin. And if we call it a crime, there must be guilty parties and punishments, but so far impunity and apathy are winning the day. It is true that the EU has legislation on the transport of toxic waste – the export of such waste has been banned since 1997, under the Basel Convention – but up to now this ban has been systematically flouted. This laissez-faire attitude is criminal, and the dead of Abidjan are its victims. The Union now needs to act, and act fast, to put a stop to the irresponsibility and the impunity. It must enforce the existing legislation, in particular the directive of July 2006 that requires the Member States to establish inspection networks. It must strengthen this legislation where necessary, to enable fast and effective sanctions, as both the Commission and the European Parliament have been demanding since 2001. Finally, it must help countries in Africa to draw up protective legislation. Commissioner, we support your proactive statements, but we now have to move on to concrete action. That is what we expect from the Council, in particular.

Between economic difficulties, the exhaustion of stocks and finicky controls, European fishing is in a bad way. Mediterranean fishermen are being hit hard. It is high time the European Union learnt its lessons from this finding. This report includes several positive guidelines, which represent the fruits both of our joining forces with the fishermen from my region and of the support of my political group. Firstly, it calls on the European Commission to review its work and to formulate more specific and more ambitious proposals in order to respond to the seriousness of the crisis hitting the sector. Secondly, it supports the professional fishermen’s organisations and their role (co-management) in applying the CFP and in improving the management of the resources. Finally, it integrates several of our amendments aimed at safeguarding small-scale fishing in the Mediterranean. With this in mind, I shall vote in favour of this report, as it constitutes a strong political signal paving the way for an ambitious EU policy. I would, however, have liked the European Parliament to have gone further in terms of demanding a specific programme for Mediterranean fisheries. Our amendment on this subject has been rejected. We will not stop there. We will continue the fight alongside the fishermen from my region.

Mr President, everyone is saying: ‘Darfur is on the brink of the abyss’. The parties involved in the conflict continue to kill and to rape. The civilian populations are their daily targets. Humanitarian workers are abandoning the area under the pressure of the acts of intimidation and, indeed, murders, since 13 have been killed over the last few weeks. The conflict is threatening the entire sub-region, extending, as it does, to Chad and to the Central African Republic. It seems that all is now set for the final assault. All is set for a massacre. The government is playing a cat-and-mouse game with the international community. It is a very cruel game that is paid for each day in hundreds of human lives. Since 2004, the Union has spared no financial efforts, and this commitment has certainly helped to prevent carnage. However, a firmer political commitment is now vital. The priority is to act as quickly as possible and to deploy, in accordance with Resolution 1706, a United Nations peacekeeping force with a mandate to use force if necessary to protect the civilians. However, the only way to protect the populations is to do so quickly, here and now - by forcing the Sudanese authorities to stop their current offensive and to apply the peace agreement to Darfur; by strengthening the mandate and by giving the material resources to the African Union forces that are on the ground and that, at the moment, do not constitute a solid enough shield to protect the civilian populations; and, as my fellow Members have said, by immediately introducing the no-fly zone provided for in United Nations Resolution 1591. Furthermore, if appeals to reason are not enough, well, let us clear the way for sanctions: an oil embargo, an international arrest warrant, and individually targeted sanctions against the perpetrators of atrocities and, in particular, against the 51 people whose names appear on the list passed on to the International Criminal Court. Ladies and gentlemen, this Parliament will not allow the first genocide of the 21st century to take place, in silence and practically in front of its very own eyes.

The CFP no longer meets the expectations of Mediterranean fishermen. That is why I welcome this plan, which includes several positive guidelines: a crucial reduction in costs and constraints for the fishermen; a revision and harmonisation of the control and monitoring provisions, under the auspices of the Community Fisheries Control Agency, which is something that Mediterranean fishermen, who all too often feel ‘harassed’, have been specifically waiting for; and closer involvement for those working in the sector in the definition of the guidelines (management of fishing efforts, control measures and catch limits), which echoes a strong demand that I am voicing at the European Parliament on behalf of Mediterranean fishermen. I also support Parliament’s request to play its full role by denying the European Commission the opportunity to decide on ‘technical measures’ by itself. The fishermen know only too well how these ‘technical measures’ have a direct and immediate impact on their activity. I will therefore vote in favour of this report, even though I would have liked it to have gone further in terms of demanding a specific plan for Mediterranean fisheries. I, for my part, will continue to wage this fight at the European Parliament, alongside the fishermen from my region.

Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, there are 175 million migrants in the world and that figure has almost tripled over the last 40 years. This is not a new phenomenon, but it has become particularly widespread within the context of globalisation and above all it is bringing us face to face with human dramas. Each day poverty and despair bring dozens and dozens of Africans to the northern shores of the Mediterranean or to the Canary Islands, and the European States’ only response is to increase the controls and patrols that force the people trying to come here to take even more risks. This migration policy on the part of the Union is based on an illusion, however! The illusion that we can make our borders impregnable, which stems from an essentially defensive and securitarian approach and which means that all the responsibility is placed on the States of the South. Even the Euro-African conference in Rabat, which will take place on 10 July, will also deal with the issue from the point of view of enforcement and border control, and we will still not hear Africa's voice. This unilateral and self-centred approach is reflected today in the arguments put forward and in the policies of ‘selective immigration’ which are all the rage in Europe. ‘Selective’ immigration for the North, but rather ‘suffered’ by the South, and from now on, therefore, a different approach must prevail in Europe. It is entirely in that spirit that I have drawn up my report. It is along those lines that I wish to propose a new approach, new instruments and to turn migration into a lever for development. First of all we must make better use of the existing tools, but above all we must maintain our commitments in the field of development aid, and, as we know, the initial phase of development will involve an intensification of migration rather than a slow-down. Of course, increasing aid is not a solution in itself. It is a necessary condition, but in itself it is not enough. I would like us next to turn attention properly to the AENEAS programme with a view to reorienting it purely towards the development aspect, and also the programme that will succeed it in 2007, but that is far away! At the moment, that programme is above all used for actions aimed at protecting the borders of the North. In 2005, for example, just seven of the thirty-nine projects funded related to countries of the South. Furthermore, if we are to establish one new financial instrument, I believe that we should create a fund to guarantee the continuity of microprojects in the poor countries. The European Union must also act in the places where migrants are located, in the places where migration begins. It is easy to target the main regions of immigration – they are often the poorest regions – and to fund the establishment of infrastructures there through targeted budgetary support: drinking water, electricity, roads, health centres and schools, in order to dissuade resourceless populations from leaving. It is also easy to identify the migration poles. We know them: they are the States or large cities with modern means of transport and communication and which are both points of reception and points of departure towards the great migration routes, from the Sahel towards the North for example. Once they are identified, we will be able to implement more actions there than we do today aimed at supporting the populations – particularly the most vulnerable, who are women and children – and help them to achieve autonomy, by means other than by mobility. An information programme on these areas aimed at migrants could also be established. I believe that Europe must also look to the potential of migrant communities in the rich countries, in terms of what they can do for the development of their countries of origin. I believe that this is a promising route which has the potential to turn migrants into agents of development, in the name of solidarity and mutual aid. This is what is known as co-development. Within this context, we must promote the transfer of funds towards countries of origin, make them more transparent, less expensive, and consider a new financial product that could take the form of a ‘development savings plan’. The Union, but in particular its Member States, must adopt innovative polices such as assuming responsibility for salary differentials for certain migrants who wish to return to their countries of origin, or systems of dual bases for researchers or doctors, within the framework of institutional partnerships amongst research institutes, universities and hospitals. We must also encourage circular migration to allow migrants to come and go, in cooperation with countries of origin, of course, and ensuring the transfer of social provision. I believe that this kind of measure will make it possible to replace the current brain drain with a circulation of brains. We are very well aware that, for many Southern countries, migration means the departure of the most skilled and enterprising citizens. This has dramatic effects for the poor countries, since this phenomenon often has an impact on essential sectors such as health and education. From this point of view, I am delighted that the Commission is putting forward proposals aimed at dealing with these challenges. What I want to see more generally, however, is for Europe to entirely change its thinking and for that thinking to be defended. We have an opportunity, since in September the UN will deal with the issue of migration and development for the first time. I would like to thank the honourable Members who have supported me in the drawing up of this report.

Mr President, on 3 August 2005, the regime of the former President Ould Taya was overthrown, with a military council declaring its intention to put a stop to totalitarian practices and to establish democracy. One might therefore imagine that these are merely declarations designed to justify what the international community referred to as a coup d'état. Then, it quickly becomes clear that not a single drop of blood has been shed, that the transitional authorities have begun talks with all of the political parties and civil society, have set out an electoral timetable and have taken the unusual step of deciding to stand in the next elections. One therefore has the feeling that something is happening in Mauritania and that this might be an opportunity to free this country from the dictatorship. From now on, our role consists in supporting the democratic process under way while respecting the timetable that the people of Mauritania have themselves set out. In this connection, I am delighted at the way in which the last constitutional elections were held. I support INEC, which must nevertheless ensure that every Mauritanian citizen can obtain his or her identity papers so as to be able to vote in the next elections and that Mauritanians living outside the country can take part in future ballots. I also support the political parties’ having the means to express themselves and to campaign on electoral platforms that act as a vehicle for proposals designed to improve the circumstances of the people of Mauritania.

Mr President, the report by my fellow Member, Mr Cornillet, illustrates the quality of the work done by the Joint Parliamentary Assembly in 2005. The JPA is a permanent forum for political dialogue that tends to become an instrument of prevention, of conflict resolution and of support for the democratic process. The role of the JPA is therefore very precious in the context of the Cotonou Agreements. It is a unique tool for dialogue between the North and the South. In the future, it must work more effectively, particularly in terms of dealing with major crisis situations, such as the one in Darfur, provided that it is given the resources to do so. This aspect is above all the responsibility of the European Union, which must attach political priority to this partnership with the ACP countries, by respecting its commitments in the negotiations under way on the sum of the tenth EDF and by finally refraining from taking back with the one hand what it gives with the other, as illustrated by the sugar reform. By finally giving the JPA the political respect that it deserves, let us thus definitively enforce what is laid down in the Cotonou Agreement, that is to say that the Assembly shall meet in Europe in the country of the EU Presidency. Let us not welcome our ACP partners in a half-hearted fashion, as that would be a downright poor political signal for us to give. However, it is also the responsibility of the JPA itself. It must make progress with its reform and its working methods, and the next development could result in regional conferences being held. This objective could be set by the beginning of 2007. Finally, we, as members of the JPA, also have a political responsibility, by abstaining, for example, from voting in separate houses, which is not only the negation of the JPA’s joint character, but also the means used all too often these days for the purposes of thwarting the outcome of a vote. I find all of that in the Cornillet report and I therefore believe that, as far as we are concerned, it constitutes a road map for 2006.

Mr President, Mr Winkler, with regard to the cooperation between the Union and the ACP countries, several sums have been put on the table: firstly by the Commission, then, in December 2005, by the Council and, in the space of a few weeks, nearly EUR 2.5 billion have disappeared. I want to believe that we are concerned here only with a gross miscalculation. Fortunately, the Commission has recently made some new proposals, on 17 March, which are marked by two significant advances: firstly, an additional package of almost EUR 1 billion for the tenth EDF, which is designed to take care of the administrative costs and, secondly, an additional package of almost EUR 300 million for the OCTs, which would thus be re-integrated into the EDF as, I might add, they are requesting. I believe that these Commission proposals are along the right lines and represent a first step on the road indicated by Parliament. The fact remains that these proposals are in the hands of the Council from now on and that it is its responsibility to try and come up with something better. It is in fact the word of the European Union and its commitment in the fight against poverty that are at stake. The word of the Union means the one that is included in Annex 1 to the revised Cotonou Agreement. Admittedly, the wording was deliberately ambiguous since it was a matter of gaining the agreement of our ACP partners on some political points that were disputed and, I might add, disputable. It was not ambiguous, however, to the point of explaining the fanciful calculations of the Council. Let us not make our African partners believe that Europe’s new motto is: ‘promises only bind those who believe in them’. Promises were in fact made in 2005. Thus, at the European Council in June, the Union and the Member States committed themselves to increasing their official development aid on a regular basis until 2015. At the G8 Summit in July, the European Union also committed itself, together with the other donors, to doubling official aid for Africa by 2010. Will we be able to keep those promises given the shrinking budget proposed by the Council for the tenth EDF? The answer is ‘no’, and the Council cannot claim otherwise. As for the management and payment procedures for this tenth EDF, I also have cause for concern, but explanations are needed as much from the Council as from the Commission. It is a question, firstly, of the funding of the ‘development’ dimension in the economic partnership agreements currently under negotiation and, secondly, of the new performance criteria set by the Commission in the working document of 13 January for the allocation of EDF funds, criteria that would be added to the traditional ‘needs’ criterion. I should like to conclude by saying a few words about the budgetisation of the EDF. This Parliament has expressed its support for the budgetisation on several occasions, since it is a question of the democratic control of the budget allocation. I believe that we could include the EDF in the budget while respecting our ACP partners because we need to get away from the intergovernmental practices that give rise to bargaining, with the kind of outcome for the EDF that we saw at the Council in December. Admittedly, this is not the issue that we are concerned with today – everything in its own time – but it should not, for all that, be forgotten about.

Mr President, 1.2 billion people have no access to drinking water, and so 15 people die in the world every minute, half of whom are children. We are therefore involved in a real race against the clock. That is why the World Forum must put forward three kinds of proposal. Firstly, the question of rights. Water belongs to all of humankind, and having access to water is a fundamental right of human beings. This right must be established by an international treaty. Next, the question of resources: to halve, by 2015, the proportion of the population without access to water is an ambitious target. An extra USD 100 billion needs to be found each year. For that to happen, we need to harness all of our resources by increasing official development assistance (ODA) and the resources allocated to the tenth EDF and by obtaining the support of innovative partners in the public and private sector or of operations designed to exchange debts for investment. Lastly, the question of management. Water policies must be developed using a participative and democratic approach that embraces users, civil societies and the role of women and be managed at local level, accompanied by the implementation of pricing policies that guarantee the most underprivileged citizens access to water at affordable prices. I hope that the Commission will champion these guidelines at the World Forum in Mexico City.

The EU has a unique responsibility and opportunity where this matter is concerned. It alone can satisfy the two conditions for putting these new mechanisms in place: critical size and political will. The text submitted to us does not, I am afraid, live up to this expectation. Admittedly, this resolution supports in principle the new sources of development funding by emphasising the need for these funds to supplement traditional public aid, and not to replace it. This position of Parliament is, however, very half-hearted. The support is reluctantly expressed, and the central concept in this debate - a ‘global tax’ to fund development - is passed over in silence. The various projects on the table today, relating for example to taxation on financial transactions, CO2 emissions and arms sales, are not mentioned. No reference whatsoever is made to ‘Global Public Goods’, which these mechanisms should fund as a priority. Given that it is a first step in the right direction, I will vote in favour of this draft resolution. I do, however, want to see it encourage swifter and more far-reaching action aimed at practically implementing these new tools at European level.

 We have to stop giving with one hand and taking away with the other! This report tries to strike a balance between protecting the income of European farmers and that of farmers in the ACP countries. It thus provides for a smaller reduction in price, spread out over time, so that the ACP countries are better able to absorb the impact of reform, and a substantial increase in access to the European market for sugar from the least developed countries. The Socialist Group in the European Parliament's two amendments also move in the right direction, by providing for the complete elimination of European export subsidies (by 2013 at the latest) and compensation for the restructuring of the sugar sector in the ACP countries, based on an estimated requirement of EUR 200 million a year. Admittedly, I would have liked the EU to go further, by providing the funds for this restructuring immediately, instead of the miserly EUR 40 million that has been promised (we proposed twice that amount in the Committee on Development). I would also have liked the 'everything but arms' initiative to enter into operation as of 2009 and the EU to make it impossible to export sugar at low prices under quota C. We will continue the battle as part of the ongoing negotiations on the financial perspective.

The Commission wants to bring into force a directive that was already rejected three times by the European Parliament during the last legislative term. This is a denial of democracy. There is, however, no reason to adopt this text today. It is a text that seriously threatens people’s safety and jobs. By means of self-handling, which allows ‘novices’ to do dock work and to handle cargo, this text introduces social dumping and calls safety arrangements into question. Out of all those groups working in the ports, not one is satisfied with this text: not the shipowners, not the pilots and not the boatmen. Why, then, if not in the name of free enterprise, do we want to turn our ports into supermarkets by selling off the port structures to the private sector? European ports are competitive, and if we were to make laws, they would relate to maritime safety, the safety of the straits, spatial planning and the very high concentration of crews in the North Sea to the detriment of the Mediterranean Sea. The Commission proposal does not meet the current requirement of our ports. It must be rejected. This month, it is the port services directive and, next month, it will be the ‘Bolkestein’ Directive. When are we going to listen to what Europeans have to say?

 European countries seem to be victims of an infectious homophobia that is cause for concern. It is a homophobia all the more shocking because people no longer appear to have any hang-ups about it and because it is everywhere rife, expressed in verbal or physical violence, the persistence of discrimination and the introduction of new legislation (for example, the Latvian Parliament has tabled an amendment to the Latvian Constitution to prohibit marriages between persons of the same sex). Whether in disguise or taken for granted, homophobia has no place in the European Union. Non-discrimination is guaranteed in the texts (the Treaties, the European Convention on Human Rights and the Charter of Fundamental Rights). It ought to be so in actual practice. Moreover, it is very much to the credit of this European Parliament always to have been in the vanguard of this fight. It has committed itself to promoting people’s rights and lessening discrimination (February 1994, September 1996, July 2001 and June 2005). It must do so again today. That is the ambition behind this resolution, which is unambiguous in condemning discrimination in all its forms. It relies on the will to bring about change, demanding that the arsenal of anti-discrimination measures be supplemented on the basis of Article 13 of the Treaty and that a communication be issued on the obstacles to the freedom of movement of homosexual couples whose partnerships are legally recognised in the EU. It is a clear and necessary political signal. I shall vote in favour of it with determination and conviction.

 I consider the ongoing reform of the sugar regime to be unfair on two counts: 1 - First for the European producers themselves, because there is a risk that the big multinational companies that consume sugar, such as Nestlé, will be the principal beneficiaries of the reform. The smaller producers, on the other hand, could suffer from the 31% reduction in the guaranteed price. 2 - Above all, though, this reform is unfair to the poor sugar-producing countries. Once again, they are the ones who have to pay the price. The figures speak for themselves. European producers can count on a package of EUR 1.5 billion in compensation and EUR 4.2 billion for restructuring the sector, while the ACP countries currently have only the prospect of EUR 40 million. This amount is obscene. In the Committee on Development, we proposed EUR 80 million. Mr Lehideux’s report aims to soften some of the pernicious effects of the reform of the EU’s sugar regime, by proposing: - to make the aid complementary to the other financial instruments of EU development policy, - measures to diversify the economies of countries that are highly dependent on sugar, such as the islands of the Caribbean or Mauritius.

 The European Union must publicly condemn the breaches of human rights and freedom of the press in Tunisia so that Tunisian public opinion is aware of it. The Tunisian Government is quite happy engaging in backroom diplomacy to brush under the carpet the increasingly worrying situation of the 401 political prisoners, the five political parties not permitted to speak freely to the Tunisian citizens, and the large number of associations that cannot operate freely. These lawyers, journalists, workers and intellectuals are being repressed and gagged. Let us, for once, address the people of Tunisia directly to tell them that the European Parliament will not fall into the trap set for it by Mr Ben Ali by continuing to accommodate a dictatorship that is no longer even attempting to disguise itself.

At a press conference held on 11 October 2004, Mr Gollnisch made remarks seemingly questioning the existence of the gas chambers. These crimes are nevertheless historical facts. To deny or to dispute this is a crime. It is up to French law to give its verdict in accordance with the Gayssot law, which forbids public speeches disputing the existence of crimes against humanity. Obviously, freedom of expression must be guaranteed for a Member of Parliament. Yet, the issue at stake in this vote is that of bringing a man, a university lecturer, face to face with his responsibilities. That is why I will vote in favour of withdrawing Mr Gollnisch’s parliamentary immunity. For the very large majority of MEPs, this vote conveys a message: revisionism has no place in the Europe of ‘never again’.

In one month’s time in Barcelona, the Euro-Mediterranean Partnership is due to be radically reformed on the basis of a number of forceful ideas. Firstly, in the fight against poverty, a Mediterranean version of the Millennium Development Goals needs to be drafted and funded and progress made with solidarity structures comparable to those found in European regional policy. Promoting democracy and human rights has to be at the heart of the partnership by practically implementing Article 2 of the Association Agreements and by bringing into widespread use the sub-committees on human rights. The fight to eliminate discrimination against women and to promote gender equality has to be the subject of a specific and priority policy area for the EU. It is women who will act as the vehicles for genuinely bringing together the different peoples and cultures around the Mediterranean basin. Common responses to the issue of immigration are required. Let us put a stop to the hypocrisy and cynicism. Let us not think about keeping our hands clean while we let our southern partners do the dirty work. We have to lay the foundations for shared management of migratory flows by adopting a generous and united approach to the issue of the movement of persons in the Mediterranean area. We require an ‘area of sustainable development’ in the Mediterranean, with a programme aimed at eliminating pollution in the Mediterranean Sea by 2020, along with a precise timescale in which this is to be carried out.

I am convinced that joining the EU is synonymous with subscribing to certain values, in particular in the area of human rights and fundamental freedoms. That is why Turkey must become a full-scale democratic country. The prospect of its joining the EU can bring about positive developments leading to a real, and not only virtual, kind of democracy, which recognises and respects its minorities, in particular the Kurdish population, and to greater respect for human rights, by putting an end to the violations of the freedom of expression such as the recent conviction of the author, Orhan Pamuk, as well as to a fresh perspective on the dark pages of its past, through recognition of the Armenian genocide. Nevertheless, on the eve of the 3 October deadline – the date on which the Council must reach a decision about the opening of the accession negotiations – we are far short of the target. On the contrary, Turkey is digging in its heels and even becoming more radical as regards at least two points: the recognition of Cyprus, which can under no circumstances form the subject of negotiations, and the stubborn refusal to tackle the issue of the Armenian genocide, a willingness to tackle which I consider to be a preliminary condition for membership. That is why I, together with others, tabled two amendments to supplement a resolution that is particularly reticent on the subject of the Armenian genocide. It is the responsibility of the European Parliament to point out to a modern Turkish State that professes to be on the road to democracy that it has a duty to remember.

Mr President, what if, after these last few rather sad weeks for the European Union, it were now to bounce back, precisely on the issue of development, and prove that it is in the vanguard of the fight against poverty. The European Union is on the right track with its twofold commitment: 0.7% of its wealth for development aid by 2015 and 50% of this increase for Africa. I am delighted that the British Presidency is making Africa its central concern. Tony Blair must also take advantage of his presidency of the G8 to obtain something other than declarations of intent from the rich: the only cheque that he must defend is the one promised at Monterrey. Further progress is needed on debt cancellation, but a premium on democracy must be introduced and new sources of finance urgently sought: taxes on the movement of capital, on the arms trade, on CO2 emissions, it does not matter, all manner of things have been put forward. We must reach conclusions now because, in the words of the slogan of the global campaign against poverty, after 2005 there will be no more excuses.

 I welcome the progress made in the Constitutional Treaty with regard to development and international solidarity, the principle of which is enshrined as one of the EU’s fundamental values. For the first time, this Treaty includes a separate chapter on cooperation with third countries and on humanitarian aid. It emphasises objectives pertaining to this policy, namely the eradication of poverty, the promotion of health and the fight against infectious diseases. It gives priority to children’s rights, and makes a great deal of progress with regard to women’s rights and their key role in development. The European Union has therefore reached a significant milestone, by acknowledging in its Constitutional Treaty that solidarity cannot be limited to its own territory and its own citizens, but should extend beyond its borders. I have a number of concerns, of course, particularly with regard to the lack of any reference to ‘global public goods’, an issue upon which I put forward proposals. Together with my Socialist colleagues, however, I intend to continue the fight to put into action and practice that which we were unable to put in the text of the Treaty.

 The European Union and the international community are preparing to write off some of Iraq’s debts and, at this moment, the debts of the countries ravaged by the tsunami. While I am glad to see this, these are reactions in the heat of the moment, associated with a pressing current situation, and it is the debt problem of the global south as a whole that must be treated with the same urgency and speed, for this disturbing reality with which we are faced is indeed urgent. The amount of debt repaid by the South in a year far exceeds the annual total of public development aid, and it is the South that is funding the North. Over twenty years, the countries of the South will have already repaid six euros for every euro borrowed and they will still be being asked for another four. If the South is to make progress, its debts must be cut back, and, today, practical responses are only slowly forthcoming. I welcome the United Kingdom’s initiative, it having announced its intention of cancelling its share in the debt incurred by the poorest countries to the World Bank, and I am impatient to see the countries of the Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development as a whole do likewise. Were they all to follow the British example, 45 million more children would be able to go to school, 140 million people would be able to have access to clean drinking water – provided, of course, that the amount of cancelled debt was added to the current development aid, and provided that the North stopped taking with one hand what it gives with the other. Right now, it is imperative that a global, fair and sustainable solution be found to the problem of debt, and the Socialist Group in the European Parliament is persuaded that it is the European Union and its Member States that can take the initiative in this. They can do this by writing off all the poorest countries’ debts, by taking measures to alleviate the position of threshold countries, by no longer imposing ‘structural adjustments’ as conditions and, of course, as has been said, we have to make this part of an all-round aid policy and, with all haste, seek new sources of finance.

 Although the Commission’s report was well-founded, its recommendations of 6 October no longer required Turkey to recognise the Armenian genocide of 1915. This genocide resulted in the death of over one million people, which was equivalent to nearly two thirds of the country’s largest minority. This crime, which was carried out with intent and which led to widespread and systematic destruction, was the first genocide of the twentieth century, and yet even today the Turkish State continues to oppose references to it. The worst possible course of action now would be to remain silent. The Commission’s silence could lead one to think that this tragedy does not concern it in any way, and that it is a problem for Turks and Armenians alone. This is something I find disturbing, not for reasons of religion, history or community, but because this is a political issue which has direct bearing on democracy and human rights. This is an issue which goes back to the very foundations of the European Union, laid after the Second World War when France and Germany affirmed their desire to bring peace to Europe. This meant that our continent’s most tragic hours were overcome, even though the full extent of the extermination of Jews would not be fully acknowledged until later. This is why the Armenian issue is crucial for a Europe seeking to become an area of freedom and anti-totalitarianism where a modern and secular citizenship flourishes.

Mr President, I should like to begin by thanking Mr Stubb for his work on this very sensitive subject. His report has the virtue of tackling the problem of integration capacity from different angles. I am therefore delighted that the text is not limited to mentioning the institutional aspects of this issue, but that it also highlights other major reforms, without which the Union could not accommodate new members. I am thinking, in particular, of the review of the Union's financing system. I am also grateful to the rapporteur for having succeeded in making sure that this report is neutral towards the candidate countries and in preventing the pitfall that would have consisted in expressing, on that occasion, a position on the entry of a given State. Finally, this report rightly emphasises the enhanced role that should be granted to Parliament, not only in the context of the accession process, but also in that of future institutional reforms. I do have one criticism to make, however: it seems to me, in fact, that, in perhaps wanting to do too much of a good job, the rapporteur has somewhat shifted the report away from its initial aim by making it more a report that concentrates on all of the reforms necessary within the European Union than on the more specific issue of integration capacity. Rather than enumerating a long list of institutional reforms, it would have been better, in my opinion, to have concentrated solely on the reforms that constitute genuine prerequisites for any further enlargement.

Mr President, I should like sincerely to thank Mrs Kratsa for her commitment and her sense of cooperation. This own-initiative report is, in my view, one of the most important reports dealing with women’s rights that we have had to express an opinion on since the start of the Parliamentary term. The situation of women migrants has been overlooked for too long by our governments, despite the fact that they are growing in number and that they now account for the majority of the people arriving on EU soil. They are the ones who forge the first links between their families and nationals in terms of society and integration. Indeed, this report offers many guidelines aimed at putting a stop to the two forms of discrimination - racial and sexual discrimination - that these women often suffer. I am particularly delighted that a number of provisions have been included in this report that concern illegal women immigrants, because they represent a sub-category that is deprived of its rights and thus made all the more vulnerable. It is therefore vital that these women can benefit, in whichever Member State they are resident, from basic rights such as access to emergency health care, legal aid and schools for their children, as is the case in my country. Finally, I am delighted that this report features another point to which I am particularly attached, namely the status of women who arrive on EU territory within the context of the family reunification process. These women often only exist in law through their husbands and are therefore placed in a situation of complete dependence. This report calls for them to be granted an independent and autonomous status as quickly as possible and, above all, for this status to be automatically preserved in the event of the couple separating. I therefore hope that this report will be adopted by a large majority within our Parliament and that the ambitious proposals that it contains will not go unheeded.

 Mr President, Parliament has to give its opinion by the end of the year on the framework programme known as solidarity and management of migration flows. I should have liked to have seen more resources given to this major instrument, but we are suffering the constraints of a draconian Financial Perspective. I hope, in any case, that the Commission will not accept any watering down of its latest proposal. Our objective must be to guarantee that the distribution between the four funds – those in relation to refugees, external borders, integration and return – reflects a balanced, rather than essentially repressive, approach to the issue of immigration. That is why we must defend the integration fund as, if the Council states that integration can be financed from the European Social Fund (ESF), the integration fund will be the only real instrument financing measures intended for new arrivals. If, finally, we have a duty of solidarity towards Member States that are particularly vulnerable in this respect, let us remember that what we are concerned with here are structural funds which, as such, are not intended to be used as emergency funds, all the more since the distribution keys in each fund allow a variety of situations to be taken into account.

Mr President, I too would like to congratulate Mrs Carlotti on her excellent work. As draftsman of the opinion of the Committee on Women's Rights and Gender Equality, I was very pleased to see that the majority of our proposals have been incorporated into the final text, in particular the protection of migrant women against discrimination and violence, and improving their access to health services, to education and to employment, as well as the need to pay special attention to the children of these female migrants, and the situation of women displaced as a result of conflicts. My only regret is that one of my proposals aimed at allowing migrant women in illegal situations access to health care and to legal and psychological support has not been included. These women in illegal situations represent a particularly vulnerable category whose fundamental rights must be protected, just like those of people with legal status. I hope that this point can be dealt with within the context of the report by Mrs Kratsa, which is specifically dedicated to the situation of migrant women.

I am also very pleased with the results of the vote within the Committee on Women's Rights and Gender Equality. In my amendments, I emphasised certain points that I feel are vital when it comes to the position of Roma women in particular: the need for Roma children to learn to read and write, and also the importance of social mixing with regard to housing and the need to provide accommodation sites for travelling Roma. Access to education still seems to present a problem for Mrs Járóka, but a majority of my colleagues in the Committee on Women's Rights and Gender Equality chose to support my proposals, for which I am grateful to them. I hope that the same will be true in plenary and, more generally, that this excellent report will receive broad support, because it is initiatives such as this that will help to provide more information to the citizens of Europe and to improve the everyday life and integration of the Roma.

Madam President, I wish to thank Mr Gargani for the clarity and commitment of his report. I am delighted that a large part of my opinion has been included and that his report took up my own two objectives, which are, first of all, the emphasis given to the fact that simplification is necessary but must not be achieved in any old fashion, and secondly, the affirmation of Parliament’s wish to participate fully in the simplification strategy. We can only welcome any initiative that aims to make the regulatory environment clearer and more coherent. It is, in fact, impossible to continue working properly with an acquis
 of more than 80 000 pages. How, in these circumstances, can we talk to the citizens about accessibility and transparency with any credibility? That is why the simplification strategy must be supported in principle. It should enable us, in the long run, to have Community and national standards that are easier to apply and less costly. This simplification, however, also entails a number of limitations, indeed dangers, and we therefore need to be vigilant. In particular, this report specifies that simplification must not take the form of a lowering of standards, that there are problems linked to the application of the Interinstitutional Agreement governing the recasting procedure and that it is therefore necessary to clarify the applicable rules in order to avoid conflicts of competence and procedural obstacles. This report also clearly affirms Parliament’s desire to fully participate in the simplification strategy and it puts the same emphasis on the need to protect Parliament’s prerogatives as on the question of the adaptation of its rules of procedure. Simplification cannot, in fact, take place outside of all democratic control and, in particular, outside the control of Parliament. Parliament must also give thought, within the context of simplification, to the improvement of its procedures and its internal legislative techniques. This issue will be the subject of a specific report that I am responsible for drafting. Finally, on the subject of alternative means of regulation, I am very pleased that this report demands a strict framework for recourse to coregulation and self-regulation, because it is essential to provide safeguards in this area.

Mr President, first of all I should like to thank the rapporteur for the quality of his work. The European political parties are essential to the formation and expression of a genuine European public opinion. Indeed, it is mainly to them that the difficult task of working for effective participation for citizens falls, and that is not only every five years at the time of the European elections, but daily and in every aspect of European political life. Mr Leinen’s report puts forward suggestions that would make it possible to give the European parties the means necessary to achieve this objective. I particularly welcome the following points: the improvement in the rules on funding through the introduction of greater clarity, flexibility, independence and financial security in the medium term; vital support for organisations and movements for young Europeans; finally, better representation of women on the electoral lists, and especially among the elected members.

 I would like to thank the two co-rapporteurs, Mr Gröner and Mrs Sartori, for their excellent work. Indeed, this report adds to the Commission's initial text a number of improvements that I had also proposed in my draft opinion in the Committee on Civil Liberties, Justice and Home Affairs. I would like to point to four of them. First of all, there is the proactive role given to the institute, particularly through its analysis and expertise missions and the option it is given of submitting its recommendations and guidelines to the Community institutions. Next, there is the importance of cooperation with the fundamental rights agency. Then there is the need for balanced participation of men and women in the management board, and, finally, there is the role of the European Parliament, particularly concerning the nomination of the director of the institute and of the members of the management board and monitoring their work. This Gender Institute is a vital part of a true Europe of citizens, and I was extremely disappointed that my draft report was rejected by the Committee on Civil Liberties, Justice and Home Affairs, 18 votes to 18, because part of the Group of the European People's Party (Christian Democrats) and European Democrats and part of the Group of the Alliance of Liberals and Democrats for Europe wanted to prevent this institute from seeing the light of day. That said, I am also pleased to see that the co-rapporteurs have incorporated the essential elements of my concerns into their report.

Mr President, as shadow rapporteur for the Socialist Group in the European Parliament in the Committee on Civil Liberties, Justice and Home Affairs, I am very pleased with the text proposed to us today and I have not, I might add, tabled any amendments for the vote in plenary. I should like, first of all, to congratulate Mr Catania, who has contributed a remarkable piece of work in the context of the Committee on Civil Liberties, Justice and Home Affairs and who has succeeded in uniting the majority of Members around his draft report. Thanks to compromise amendments drawn up jointly by the Confederal Group of the European United Left/Nordic Green Left, the Group of the Greens/European Free Alliance, the Socialist Group in the European Parliament and the Group of the Alliance of Liberals and Democrats for Europe, and thanks also to individual amendments tabled by Members of these groups, it seems to me that we have taken a number of important steps forward. I will mention five of them. The European Parliament is calling on the Member States to consider establishing a closer link between permanent legal residence over a reasonable period of time and the acquisition of national – and hence European – citizenship. It is underlining its desire for greater coordination of the general criteria and procedures for the acquisition of nationality in the Member States. Secondly, Parliament is calling on the Member States to discuss the possibility of drawing up a European voter’s card common to all the EU countries. Thirdly, it is calling on the Commission to draw up a white paper on possible developments in EU citizenship. Fourthly, it is calling on the Member States to extend the right to vote in local and European elections to third-country nationals and to stateless persons permanently residing in the European Union for more than five years, as well as the right of free movement and the right to a residence permit in any of the EU Member States. Finally, Parliament is calling on the Member States to discuss forthwith the possibility of granting EU citizens the right to vote and to stand for election in the municipal, local and regional elections of the Member State in which they are resident, as well as granting them the choice of voting and standing for election in national elections either in the country in which they are resident or in their country of origin, though not in both. Through these requirements and these desires expressed by the European Parliament, it is indeed a question of developing the Union into a real political community. Political citizenship and democratic participation are the keys to the very future of the European project that we desire.

Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, the signing of the joint memorandums on social inclusion by all of the new Member States and by the Commission marks a clear political commitment aimed at putting the fight against poverty and social exclusion at the heart of every national policy. Parliament supports and upholds this step. Our Committee on Civil Liberties, Justice and Home Affairs calls in particular on the Commission to succeed in outlining a common policy in the form of a common theme, a clear policy shared by all of the Member States. In order to do this, the European Commission has to consider the appropriateness of choosing the open method of coordination, which is clearly unable to fully achieve the assigned objective; make sufficient funds available for the project, in order to make the citizens and residents of the new Member States more involved in the European project; carry out an evaluative across-the-board analysis, refocusing on the failure to respect civil liberties, access to fundamental rights and the fight against all forms of discrimination, and facilitate the task of preparing any sanctions that may be needed; highlight more clearly the problems relating to access to the law and justice, with a more detailed analysis of migration patterns, distinguishing between immigration of third-country nationals and the situation of other ethnic or cultural minorities; review the existing division of responsibilities between the Union, the Member States and the regions, and propose means of institutionalising the ‘best practice’ approach; ensure access to the legal system for vulnerable groups and minorities; unify, streamline and simplify the emergency procedures and resolve the remaining problems regarding stateless or other persons in difficulty who continue to be denied citizenship or the right of residence. As a result of these efforts concerning fundamental rights, the European Union can develop towards achieving a greater level of justice and shared civic values, which are the foundations of the social Europe that we all hope and pray for.

Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, I first wanted to thank, in particular, Mr Lax for our excellent collaborative effort. Parliament is about to establish its position on a crucial issue: the reciprocity mechanism on visas. Behind the dryness of technical terms lies, in fact, a very vital reality: that of giving substance to, and advancing, in a tangible and positive way, cooperation between Member States, in the face of the complex relations of an enlarged Union with third countries on the subject of visas. We are dealing here with something that lies at the heart of what constitutes the richness of Europe, namely respect for the law in all its forms in rediscovered peace and harmony. We are attempting to build a harmonious space between Europe and the rest of the world, where borders are not walls rising up between one party and another, dividing people and nations. We must ensure that Europe is a recognised space, where it is possible to come and go without interference, on good terms with third countries near or far. It is also an act of confidence towards our 420 million citizens. It has, furthermore, become necessary, in moving in this direction, to completely review a method that favours a too inflexible approach. Ladies and gentlemen, the report that I call upon you to approve takes a fresh look at the amendments required for inclusion in the Regulation in force since 2001. In this context, I express my full interest in the principle of pushing aside the systematisation of sanctions currently implemented in the event of a lapse from one side or the other, between the European Union and the third countries in question. These reprisals often arise, either from a technical, or even an administrative, issue, or from inappropriate political decisions, which diplomatic efforts must crucially seek to resolve in the first instance. In its current state, reciprocity of sanctions is neither desirable nor appropriate as a response to often complex issues occurring on a day-to-day basis. In the last resort, in fact, it is our citizens who pay a high price for it by not being allowed to travel freely, not to mention the very costly inconvenience that that causes. That is why, in accordance with a sensibly drafted plan, a forum for discussion corner needs to be created, where Parliament has its full place. Our legitimacy as elected representatives of the citizens is also at the heart of this report that, in the course of the work in committee, has attracted a very large consensus on the new method for consideration. In particular, we must succeed in guaranteeing all European citizens free, unimpeded movement outside the borders of the Union. Parliament must, as a consequence, be closely involved in this process, as it is clearly the legitimate guarantor of transparency in assuming the rightful democratic responsibility it has been accorded by its electorate. This in no way reduces the prerogatives of the Commission, whose role emerges very noticeably strengthened so that it may appear a credible negotiator to the third countries concerned. Ladies and gentlemen, that is why I call upon you to vote in favour of this text tomorrow. It represents a successful combination of the roles of the European legislative and executive powers, which are united in the service of the citizens and the project we hold dear: that of building a solid European Union upon the values of freedom, security and justice.

 Mr President, a Constitution for Europe is necessary: it is a democratic requirement. Profoundly attached to the unity of the party, the French Socialists will conduct the national debate without in any way giving up our progressive values and ideas. I consider that approval of the report is the condition for establishing Parliament’s authority in respect of the Constitutional Treaty, but I am sorry that amendments tabled by a number of us have been rejected. Nonetheless, we shall be part of this long and treacherous process that is the ratification of the Constitutional Treaty. We state that this Constitutional Treaty is stable but capable of being modified. That is the case with all constitutions, and with this Treaty no less than with others. We also regret the fact that a large majority of the opinions issued by other parliamentary committees that have identified a host of shortcomings in the Constitutional Treaty have been left out of this report. We are also keen to state clearly that a special unit, established under the Dutch Presidency, will continue with its work under the future Presidencies and will carefully scrutinise all the possible consequences of the Constitution’s being rejected. I want Parliament, legitimised in its role following this vote, to get to grips with the difficulties of implementing the Constitutional Treaty and to use its parliamentary right of initiative. That is what we are called upon to do, and it is what Amendment No 17 is all about. Yes, it is incumbent upon ourselves as MEPs and elected representatives of the European people to take a proactive role in implementing the Constitutional Treaty, which governs the corporate life of more than 450 million Europeans. The difficulties revealed by the opinions of the other committees will resurface sooner or later. We must therefore be prepared to correct the imperfections bequeathed by the Intergovernmental Conference when it altered the delicate balance achieved wisely and equitably by the Convention. Let us prepare ourselves, ladies and gentlemen, for a new round. It is, indeed, going to be necessary to defend our popular legitimacy in respect of the Constitutional Treaty, whose shortcomings we have an absolute duty to correct when the time is right. A number of my colleagues in the French delegation will abstain from voting on this report.

 The Florenz report establishes a very detailed list of the actions to be taken to combat climate change and to develop support policies. However, it suffers from structural weaknesses with regard to the vital and desirable reorientation of the European Union. The major defects are financial. Although the creation of a carbon tax is envisaged, the analysis and implementation of this and also of the systematic carbon offset per product are not included in the 2009-2014 Action Plan. Nevertheless, this is an essential element. No budgetary figure has been mentioned for the definitive targeted activities and projects, for public infrastructure or innovative industrial policies, for regional development, for aid to local authorities or for research and development. With regard to industry, the reference to ‘legislative instruments’ will not suffice. Likewise, the setting-up of a European Climate Fund is subject to the requirement ‘of allowing the market to determine which technologies should be used…’ Therefore, it will favour neither a long-term vision nor the general interest. This is absurd. Therefore, it is imperative that the EU very quickly looks into the question of a carbon tax, public aid to support a green New Deal and the Community budget for the prevention of climate change.

 Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, we must revive the great industrial policies on which the European Union was founded. This was the case for coal and steel. The strength of these policies lay in the fact that that they were modernisation tools – as must be the decarbonisation of the automotive sector – while, at the same time, being social policies for the support, defence, training and protection of employees. Therefore, I would like to put forward four proposals. Firstly, the creation of a European Support Fund for Employees in the Automotive Sector that exceeds the Modernisation Fund because it is important to retain employees in companies during these crucial periods by supporting their level of remuneration in the event of short-time working and by supporting their training within the company. We cannot be content with hypothetical retraining of employees who have been made redundant. Secondly, we must create an agency for innovation and accelerate the funding of research and development in order to advance very quickly and close the technological gap between clean vehicles and safe vehicles. Thirdly, accelerate the renewal of the vehicles on the road. Premiums for scrapping vehicles can be effective. They need to be harmonised at European Union level in order to avoid the effects of unhealthy competition. However, I would like to close on this point. I fully understand the meaning of the word competition, but it is also necessary... (The President cut off the speaker)

 I voted in favour of the four directives on the energy and climate change package because it was important for the EU to adopt these texts before 2009 and the international negotiations. To postpone it would have delayed taking action and accrued delays, without guaranteeing an improved text. I voted YES: - because the 3x20 targets have been confirmed (20% reduction of greenhouses gases, 20% reduction of energy consumed, 20% renewable energy) and an increase to a 30% reduction of greenhouse gases in the event of a more ambitious international agreement; - because it is vital since the texts proposed by the Council do not go as far as the Commission’s proposals and there is a risk of not achieving the stated targets – staggering over time, a large number of derogations, the possibility of financing gas reductions from outside the EU, which delays the essential decarbonisation of our industries, economies and means of development; - as a precaution, because if the targets are not met on the way, Parliament will have to impose new policies; - because it is a first step. I have always believed that emissions trading schemes would not transform our industry or our activities, in order to reduce their environmental impact. We must contemplate significant appropriations for research and innovation, establishing standards and customs tariffs in order to tackle environmental dumping, as well as industrial policies and European funds to accompany the changes.

Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, let me in my turn thank Mrs Laperrouze and all the shadow rapporteurs, as well as the Slovenian Presidency, for the work they have done. This is the last daughter directive under the framework directive on water, and it was very important for us to reach a compromise that represents genuine progress in terms of our ambition to combat pollution, and in particular the chemical pollution of water. It is clear from the news every day how much the presence of PCBs damages our Community’s water resources. Mme Laperrouze has listed all the points on which we have made progress. Of course, as ever with compromises, we would have preferred to achieve more, but I believe we have secured a good basis. Quite simply, we will remain vigilant because much will now depend on the Commission, and we hope that when it takes measures to support the findings of scientific experts, it will prove to be very ambitious in classifying future priority substances and priority hazardous substances, the famous 13 substances that are to be classified in the very near future. We will also take care to ensure that the current scientific uncertainty as regards sediments and biota will not create a kind of soft focus that will in the long term exempt the European Union from endeavouring to understand and improve the quality of those biota and sediments. Lastly, there is a need to improve the mixing zones and the knowledge of pollutants and sources of pollution, together with the monitoring of emissions. We will ensure that Parliament remains vigilant, and I thank the Commissioner for pointing out that alongside the provisions in the compromise on which we will be voting, the Commission wanted to provide information on the implementation of the framework directive on water and, if necessary and if any delays build up in the Member States or any doubts need to be raised, to present complementary measures to ensure that we do indeed achieve environmentally acceptable water in 2015, in line with our vote in 2000.

 Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, the directive that Parliament should adopt at its second reading is extremely important because it is the first directive that forces Member States to have an environmental strategy to restore the seas and oceans to a good ecological status. When we looked at it, at its first reading, we stressed its importance given that recent scientific reports show that the survival of fish stocks and the biodiversity of the seas and oceans are under particular threat. Some people are even saying that in fifty years’ time there will be no more fish. Furthermore, the oceans play a fundamental role in regulating the climate and by polluting them we are in danger of diminishing this regulating function and accentuating the negative effects of climate change. It was therefore urgent and necessary for the European Union, having adopted the water framework directive, particularly regarding freshwater, to swiftly address the issue of seawater. At its first reading, we demonstrated our willingness to improve the existing text. First I will go over the structural points of this directive and the existing texts. The first aim is to restore our seas and oceans to a good ecological status. The second is to define the necessary steps to be taken by each Member State: firstly, to collaborate within Marine Regions or Sub-Regions; then to define the state of the water and of biodiversity in these seas; then to define a good ecological status and some priority environmental objectives; and finally to draw up a plan of action and some measures to be taken. We were therefore positive about this directive, but felt it did not go far enough in the state it came to us from the Commission. There are a number of points we have stressed. The first is the need to make this directive tough. Tough, both as regards resources and as regards results. That has certainly been the most positive point of our collaboration with the Council and Commission: the directive is tough. The second point is that we hope that good ecological status will be defined stringently, so that restoring this asset is not just all talk. We have largely been satisfied in that the criteria for good ecological status have been extended to include pressure from all pollutants affecting an ecosystem and the need to evaluate them and reduce their impact with this aim of restoring good ecological status. The third point is that Parliament is very keen on setting up protected marine areas, the types of reserve that should play a key role in restoring the diversity of this biotope and particularly in reconstituting fish stocks. We would have liked a text that was more restrictive, more stringent, tougher about the need for these reserves, but the principle is still there; at any rate, the need for them to be sufficiently large to play a role in restoring biodiversity is still there. Finally, Parliament wanted the scope of the directive to be extended. In particular we wanted coastal waters to be properly taken into account, and we did not want any uncertainty to remain about the need to take account of all tidal waters. At any rate, for a lot of them this has been the case. We would of course have liked a slightly better definition of the land covered by tidal waters, but the text we have is adequate. I would like to stress the importance of the consistency of strategies by geographical area: we would have liked the text to be tougher, but the need for consistency is affirmed. Finally, our fellow Members from the Baltic wanted the Baltic to be a sort of pilot project enabling us to move more quickly, in view of the urgency of the situation. They were not completely satisfied because the tradition in our institutions is not to single out any particular area. Nevertheless, the idea of a pilot area has been kept, and I am sure the Commission would choose the Baltic to be this area. Lastly, there is the matter of timescale: the main thing for us was that the directive should be binding, even if it meant slightly lengthening the amount of time the Member States were given to achieve it. This was the compromise that was settled on in the end. The deadline is 2020, but the Member States must not drag their feet because they need to have the directive transposed by 2010. Anyway I would invite them not to waste time because, under the water framework directive, the delay is mounting up and our seas cannot wait.

 This resolution should have provided a chance to affirm a few urgent matters and to state what the European Parliament is actually expecting of the European Union institutions to ensure a revival of growth, shared social progress in our 27 Member States and development for the developing countries. There is none of this, but just the same old story of what a good thing globalisation is. There is nothing about a democratic counterweight to the ECB imposing a monetary policy that favours industry and jobs. There is nothing about a strategy to counteract the EU’s permeability to hedge funds and sovereign wealth funds. There is nothing about Community preference and the strict imposition of social (ILO) or environmental standards. There is nothing about development aid, which is essential for co-development. Why are we surprised about the low growth in Europe, social problems and the people’s mistrust?

Ladies and gentlemen, Madam President, Commissioner, this is a matter of urgency, as we all know. Al Gore, who rang the alarm bell, has been awarded the Nobel Prize, and it is time for the European Union to stop talking and to act, because this is not a new issue. There was a voluntary agreement entered into by car manufacturers to achieve average emissions of 140g of CO2
 per kilometre by 2008, and that agreement was not kept. I would remind you that the European Parliament itself fixed the target of 120g by 2005 or 2010 at the latest. There is no justification today for backing away from those targets. So what we need is an ambitious, unambiguous and binding directive and it needs to set targets in two stages. First, in the short term, we need a target of 120g of CO2
 for new cars and a 10g reduction to be achieved through complementary measures. We need to move swiftly, however, and we therefore support the vote in the Committee on the Environment for the target to be achieved in 2012, with binding steps from 2009 onwards so that by 2012 the target will be met in full for all vehicles. As the second stage, we believe it is essential to set targets of 95g for 2020 and 70g for 2025, with an intermediary deadline in 2016 to ensure that we are on track. We therefore support the ambitious roadmap prepared by the Committee on the Environment because we think it succeeds in setting clearly visible standards, while at the same time confronting us with the technology gap that we need to overcome in order to meet our Kyoto Protocol commitments. Yes, of course, it is going to be expensive and there will have to be negotiation about the price of new vehicles. The first thing to note is that not all cars and not all manufacturers achieved the same effectiveness under the voluntary agreement. Yes, we do need to favour small cars over large cars and we need to come up with tax measures, new practices and even bans in some cases, particularly in built-up areas, to prevent large vehicles, including 4x4s, from polluting our towns and cities all day long and producing huge quantities of CO2
. This question is particularly important because the bigger the vehicles that manufacturers produce, the bigger their profit margins. We therefore need to guide the market in such a way that manufacturers producing smaller, less polluting vehicles can be more profitable than those producing big high-polluting cars and, as well as setting standards, we expect the Commission to propose strategies for moving in that direction. The last point I should like to stress is the importance of proper information for vehicle purchasers to help them pick their way through this minefield, and specifically we need to get rid of misleading advertising. That is why my group has tabled an amendment requiring a labelling system for all cars, based on an A-G format for energy efficiency, so that all consumers can make an active choice in favour of the environment.

I voted in favour of all the amendments that emphasised the environmental dimension of this maritime policy. It is imperative that the environmental pillar of the maritime strategy not be a mere add-on for spiritual enrichment purposes, but that the restoration of the good ecological status of the seas and oceans be an essential objective on which the judgments in the other policies of the EU and the Member States depend. The deterioration of the oceans’ ecosystem has serious consequences for the planet and human activities: fishery stocks are disappearing and the role of the climate and the oceans as regulators is diminishing. This is primarily due to the pollution created by human activities. Therefore, the priority of the environment must be forcefully affirmed, and the future framework directive on marine waters must be binding on the Member States and on EU policies.

I consider it unacceptable that the European Parliament should have rejected the request for a referendum on the new institutional treaty. Indeed, the ‘No’ vote cast by the people of France and of the Netherlands on the old draft Constitution highlighted a huge gap between the expression of the people and that of the leaders and elected representatives, whether national or European. It is therefore only by consulting the citizens once again that we can legitimise this new treaty. It would be best if this referendum were European. The European Parliament should not be surprised that it has discredited itself in the eyes of the citizens with these kinds of reports!

I cannot accept this total deregulation or the abolition of the Member States’ ‘reserved area’ for postal missions. This across-the-board opening up to competition harms the single piece tariff, equality of treatment for the regions and the presence of postal services in disadvantaged sectors. Even in the United States, competition is not obligatory for standard mail – weighing less than 50 g – and it is distributed by a federal agency. Clearly, the methods of funding compensation for the universal service, reduced as it is to a minimum, will in no way safeguard the public service, and extending the deadline for the implementation of this liberalisation does not really solve a thing. The Council of European Ministers has just decided to create a ‘protocol on public services in support of the Treaty’. It would be quite normal to suspend any new opening up to competition of these services.

I did not endorse the report which, in the name of modernity, aims to embark on a new stage of flexibility in the workplace, painting in glowing colours a form of flexicurity of which the security dimension, I am afraid to say, is virtually non-existent. It is across-the-board flexibility that is immediate and definite, and security that is rare, indefinite and postponed until a later date. Nothing escapes the report – working time, pay, guarantees, working conditions. We are light years away from protecting a European social model. If we are to move in the direction of flexicurity, let us begin with more security, because too much flexibility is imposed on workers!

The management of mercury is an important issue for the conservation of the environment. If Europe has more waste mercury to store, it is because our industries did not foresee the risks involved in the use of this metal, in particular for the production of chlorine. First lesson: we must very quickly rethink our production methods in order to be prepared for a vital ecological revolution. Next, it is necessary to constantly monitor the storage of waste, by setting up regular checks. That is why I voted in favour of Amendment 25 which rules out permanent storage above-ground and underground. Alas, it did not receive a majority of votes. Nonetheless, the other improvements in the text justify a vote in favour of the final report.

I voted in favour of the introduction of the euro in Malta and Cyprus, because it is a matter of supporting strengthened integration of these countries in the sense given by the European Union. Nonetheless, this decision ought to have been accompanied by measures enabling more democratic control of the single currency (establishment of real economic government of the euro zone capable of balancing the power of the European Central bank (ECB), changing the Central Bank’s objectives so as to include research for growth and full employment, changing the criteria of the Stability Pact so as not to penalise public investment policy in the future).

I believe that the majority of the European Parliament has not sought to respond to the message sent out by the EU populations that rejected the Constitutional Treaty. By rejecting Amendment 1, Parliament has refused to allow the people to be consulted by referendum on any new treaty. The fact is, this element is crucial because the opportunity for them to impose social policies or policies matching their aspirations depends on it. This is a major shortcoming of the European Union. That is why I shall vote against this report.

 Madam President, I should like to begin by congratulating Mrs Isler Béguin, who has used a great deal of her energy, skill and talent to secure this very positive decision today. I should also like to thank my fellow shadow rapporteurs, because I believe that it is the united front of all the groups in this House and the understanding of the Commission that have enabled us to succeed. The political signal sent out by our Parliament is clear: we want to defend environmental policies with budgets, because, while it is important for Europe to enact rules and to set objectives, it is just as important for it to release financial resources so as to pave the way for action at local level and also for innovation, exchanges of experiences and new practices. The second message is that we are defending a Community principle, a European principle, and not simply an intergovernmental principle. Environmental policies are the policies that are regarded as being the most legitimate by all of the EU Member States – they are policies that are regarded as having a Community dimension. It would have been stupid for LIFE to have been re-nationalised when our fellow citizens expect more in the way of integration, and I shall not reiterate here the arguments put forward by my fellow Members, who have pointed out that the Member States were obviously making proposals, but that the final arbitration fell to the Commission, and that it was then crucial to provide the Commission with back-up resources, as much for the purposes of studying the dossiers as for those of taking stock of the innovations, via communication, exchanges and activity weeks – well done! Well done on doubling the amount of appropriations that will thus be devoted to the Commission! Well done also on the transnational projects. It is truly important for practices to unite different countries that have common aims, countries that, at times, do not see the link that unites them with regard, for example, to biodiversity, and that, thanks to LIFE, may have the opportunity to demonstrate their similarities when it comes to their actions and exchanges of experiences. Finally, I should like to conclude, Commissioner, with a wish, and that is that the Commission honours the commitment that it made to our rapporteur and properly takes stock of all the appropriations that have been harnessed for Natura 2000, so crucial is it for this major fight for biodiversity to be supported locally because, in many cases, on the ground, people are still doubtful or are not always aware of what is at stake. In any case, well done on this conciliation – on this final agreement – and long live LIFE!

Madam President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, we have here an extremely important daughter directive of the water framework directive. I would remind you that this framework directive provides for the restoration of the good ecological status of surface and fresh waters in the European Union by 2015, and I must tell you, Commissioner, that its very slow implementation worries us greatly. The fact remains that it was crucially important to provide a framework for the ban on priority substances and priority hazardous substances, some of which must disappear, and to enact standards relating thereto. Originally, the framework directive provided for complete consistency with the international conventions on seas, not least the OSPAR Convention. This convention contains a list of substances that are destined gradually to disappear, and my group felt that it was vital systematically to integrate into the list of priority hazardous substances in the directive those that appear in the OSPAR Convention. However, for the sake of compromise, the Socialist Group in the European Parliament accepted the proposal made by our rapporteur, Mrs Laperrouze – to whom I should like to pay tribute for her sterling work and personal commitment – and withdrew its amendment. In any case, the PSE will ensure that, once the work of the experts and the impact studies are complete, the Commission actually sets to work on achieving the highest level of protection because, as you know, what is at stake is not only the quality of our waters, but also the quality of our seas and oceans and consistency with the ‘Marine strategy’ draft directive, which we examined at first reading. As for the rest, we fully endorse the proposals that have been supported by the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Food Safety, which I shall summarise as follows. Firstly, that there be identical measuring methods throughout the European Union, which, I might add, will be easier for the Member States and clearer for Europeans. Secondly, that there be transitional areas, of course, but with a cut-off date that was set, or in any case proposed, at first reading as 2008, if I remember rightly. Thirdly and finally, the very important point that we gradually ensure that our legislative proposals are fully consistent, so often criticised are we for accumulating different ideas, and the final arbitration must be made clear to Europeans.

I take a positive view of the fact that the European Parliament is interested in this major issue of housing in the European Union. This is a first step, but one that is far from addressing the main issue: guaranteeing the right to housing to all those who live in the European Union. This right needed to be confirmed in the Charter of Fundamental Rights which, today, makes it possible at least for the Member States to give aid to the very poor. This is a restrictive view of the right to housing – a right that ought to become universal and effective for all. What is more, the principle of having widespread competition in the single market has harmful effects on the completion of social housing, which is crucial in all of our countries. I am particularly worried about the fact that the collection of the Livret A
 – a system that guarantees ongoing funding for low-cost housing – in France is being called into question. I therefore believe that this report calls for a new stage and that we need to go further in terms of ensuring that housing policies cater for specific circumstances.

 I abstained from voting on Mr Lamassoure’s report on the grounds that I am not in favour of the cofinancing of the first pillar of the CAP as referred to in paragraph 25, which opens the door to the inevitable renationalisation of one of the few truly common policies. I might add that this idea has already been put forward – but quite rightly rejected – at the time of the 2000 Berlin Agreement. It does not appear to me to be well-advised to give the CAP – which is supposed to be fairer and more compatible with sustainable development – a new direction on the basis of its being cofinanced by the Member States.

Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, I should like to emphasise three points with a view to having our Parliament improve the directive. Firstly, we need quantified targets, in particular for waste reduction, which our Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Food Safety was right to establish as a long-term objective. This is important not only where protecting the environment is concerned, but also when it comes to making us less vulnerable in the area of supplies of raw materials, which we know are much fought-over in the world. Secondly, if incineration cannot be prohibited, then maximum restrictions must be imposed on it. This is a form of disposal, not recovery. Of course, energy production is better than disposal, but let us not get confused: incineration is a form of disposal. Thirdly, we need to strengthen the principles of proximity and self-sufficiency in relation to waste management, especially for the various forms of disposal and incineration, otherwise we are going to see an almost uncontrollable phenomenon develop regarding the transport of waste, with an increase in greenhouse gases and in the risks of environmental dumping. The fact is that the best practices are not always the cheapest. Weakening the principle of proximity in order to create a large market in waste would benefit the large economic groups concerned and not the environment. To do so is therefore unacceptable.

 I voted for the removal of this report, because the process of liberalising and deregulating public services, and in particular passenger transport, must be stopped as a matter of urgency. In refusing to conduct a public investigation into the situation, the EU must, furthermore, take stock of the negative impact of its policy and of the citizens’ growing opposition to it. The slightest new step towards opening up to competition is unacceptable until a framework directive on public services is able to provide guarantees of equality between the regions and of proper spatial planning, as well as pricing policies ensuring much-needed redistribution, and the future investment needed to deliver modern, high-quality infrastructure. All the indicators are that, in Europe, safety will be cut back and that rail services, especially where profitability is low, will suffer. This will run counter to the objectives of combating the greenhouse effect and will exacerbate inequality.

 I am voting against this report which, under the pretext of sustainable development and energy security, proposes a new stage of liberalisation and competition in a sector in which public services should, on the contrary, be consolidated. The report asserts the necessity of increasing the separation between actors responsible for the marketing of energy and the owners and managers of energy networks. What is more, it insists on imposing a difference in the ownership of these two areas. Clearly, this is a challenge to the existence of public enterprises responsible for the entirety of public service functions. I cannot validate such a policy of privatisation and total competition: it will lead to an increase in energy prices, it does not ensure the reduction of energy consumption, nor does it ensure the development of renewable energy sources, and it increases inequalities between regions and citizens.

 Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, let us see how far we have come with the project before us today. REACH will change our relationship to chemical pollution considerably, by reversing the burden of proof, first of all; then by systematically providing information all down the line. A previous speaker mentioned the asbestos scandal. We are well aware that a scandal of that kind would be impossible with the text we are voting on today. The public needs to know that. There are all these gains, it is true, but there are of course also things with which we are not satisfied, or not satisfied enough, starting with natural substances: I would have liked us to be a little clearer, as it may cause problems. I do not think a natural substance is really a chemical substance. As regards imports, I would also have liked us to have more guarantees that we can impose similar standards on importers. Then, obviously, there is this major issue of substitution. Like many of you, I, too, would have liked substitution to be automatic, systematic and immediate. At first reading, I voted in favour of all the amendments to that end, but I noticed that we do not have the qualified majority. If Mr Sacconi had not managed to reach this compromise, we would be taking a great risk, at the vote on the second reading, of not having this principle implemented. After all, it must be said that the compromise does include the principle. What is in question is not the principle but its gradual, progressive implementation, – inadequate in my opinion – but the principle exists for all dangerous substances. Let us not therefore overlook the effort our fellow Member has made and the victory we have achieved on that front. Now, having established the principle, we are going to have to see that it is adequately implemented. That will depend on the Agency’s resources – financial resources, human resources – on pressure from the public and on the amount of money that will be devoted to research. Furthermore, on this point, we want the Commission to be particularly proactive in ensuring that this compromise leads to all the progress we are hoping for.

I voted in favour of the amendment to reject this directive. The directive is a step back in comparison with the vote at first reading because it leaves the application of the country of origin principle open and in no way excludes public services – SGIs, SGEIs – from this ‘free competition’, with the result that they will become very destabilised. The European Commission explains that the text does not clearly establish which law will apply and thus that private international law, which is closely related to the country of origin principle, will apply most of the time. The room for manoeuvre that the Member States have to act on the social field will be extremely reduced. In spite of the formal progress made, little by little, the liberal reality will impose itself with this text, and our social model will be jeopardised.

Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, allow me first of all, as rapporteur, to thank my fellow shadow rapporteurs from the various groups and the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Food Safety for supporting a joint piece of work aimed at enhancing the Commission proposal. As you said, Commissioner, the seas and oceans of our planet are in a worrying state: a crisis point has been reached. Moreover, a recent study published in the Science 
review sounded the alarm bell by highlighting the risks of fishery resources disappearing from our seas and oceans. The quality of the marine ecosystem plays a fundamental role in the planet's global environment and, in particular, plays a very important role in regulating the climate. Our seas also play a decisive role in people’s lives in every part of the globe. As you pointed out, they play a major economic role when it comes to fishing, transport, tourism, sources of raw materials or even activities carried out along the coastlines that border them. Yet, our seas and oceans are subjected to growing pressure and worrying pollution. Let us first address this figure: 80% of maritime pollution comes from the land, and, as you said, Commissioner, there is clearly a direct link between the framework directive on water and the directive that you have presented and that our Parliament wishes to enhance. However, if pollution comes from the earth via water, then it also comes via the atmosphere. Recent studies show a significant interaction between atmospheric movements, air pollution and the sea and oceans, such that urbanisation and human activities taking place far away from the coasts may have a direct impact on the quality of water. Pollution is also caused by activities linked to the exploitation of the oceans and seas, such as transport and aquaculture. A few years ago, waste produced by fishing and oil industry activity reached altogether excessive and dangerous levels in certain sectors. We are also at a time when we can see new threats looming, which the directive must anticipate. In particular, we are seeing a large increase in the number of projects aimed at desalinating seawater. We have to be certain that these activities are not going to affect the quality of water in the future. Major international debates are taking place on the storage of carbon dioxide. Thus, we can see that the threats are, indeed, real. The aim of the directive has been to implement a structure enabling us finally to have access to a strategy that goes beyond international agreements, the results of which have mostly not lived up to our hopes thus far. Our directive is based on a fundamental point: restoring the good ecological status of seas. Parliament would like, Commissioner, the requirement for results to be far more present and far stronger than the text in its current state provides for. Secondly, our Parliament would like the good ecological status of seas and oceans to be defined with a great deal more precision so that this is not some sort of pious hope and so that we come closer to doing what can be done to restore the life and balance of the ecosystem. Thirdly, our Parliament would like the deadlines to be shorter and, at any rate, we would like there to be a good balance between the deadlines, the level of the demands regarding good ecological status and the requirement for results. Finally, we advocate the creation of marine protected areas, because the experiences of the Americans and the New Zealanders have shown that these protected areas – indeed, in some cases, these genuine marine reserves – were such as to enable fish stocks to be built up again. Finally, we would like territorial cohesion to be enhanced by an effective piece of work carried out at marine and submarine regional level, without, however, the Member States being exempted from their responsibilities in view of the objectives set by the management plans and the plans for measures aimed at restoring good ecological status. We are anxious to include the Black Sea in the document. We would like to sound the alarm bell concerning the Arctic: we need to think about the future of this part of the world. It is directly linked to us and its development has a considerable impact on the future of the planet, which may be endangered as a result. We would like the outermost regions of the Union, which do not yet feature in the document, gradually to become at least the subject of an appropriate strategy. I shall conclude by mentioning the democratic issues. We see everyday, whether we are talking about fishing or transport, that sea users, ecologists and scientists feel the need to exchange their points of view so that the decisions that are taken are taken on the basis of a shared diagnosis and of a rational analysis of the problems. In any case, that is the spirit of the amendments that we have tabled.

 This vote is in response to an unacceptable multiannual budgetary framework. Detailed examination of the budget headings shows the blatant inadequacy of appropriations to many areas such as research, innovation, the big technological projects such as Galileo and the great trans-European networks. This budget will not encourage the stimulation of growth in Europe. European aid to the countries of the South, Africa and the Maghreb is light years away from a development policy such as needs to be implemented as a matter of urgency in order to tackle extreme poverty and unbalanced migration. It is urgently necessary to devise a European tax guaranteeing a high level of own resources for a European budget that is finally a match for what is at stake.

 The rapporteur quite legitimately wants to counteract the European Commission's unfortunately chronic liberal excesses. It is unacceptable that the Commission has tried, in its communication, to reintroduce the country of origin principle even though it was rejected by Parliament during the vote on the Services Directive. I would join with the rapporteur in calling for this directive to be implemented and enforced strictly as soon as possible, and for fines to be introduced. The Commission must accept Court of Justice case-law, which establishes that there is a difference between self-employed workers and posted workers, and provides more favourable social standards for the latter.

Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, EADS and the industrial projects that this group comprises, including Airbus, make it one of the great flagships of Europe, an industrial flagship, the symbol of our future technology and capabilities. However, this business is in great difficulty. I shall not dwell on the reasons – including those to do with the way in which it has been managed – which may justify or explain some of its current difficulties, which, in turn, require effective remedies. I shall emphasise, instead, the statements made by Airbus’s management team, who explain to us that, if the business is to be competitive, it will probably have to relocate or set up a number of its operations in the so-called ‘dollar’ currency area, for the sole reason that the euro/dollar exchange rate is putting one of the European Union’s most important cutting-edge sectors at a disadvantage. When questioned on this point, Mr Trichet has only one thing to say: ‘I do not have to explain myself regarding the exchange rate!’.

I voted against the Rapkay report. It does not acknowledge the need for a framework directive for SGIs and SGEIs and thus leaves the door open for a continuation of the current process of deregulation, which jeopardises our public services, as well as the opportunity for everybody, no matter where they live, to access these vital services. A framework directive should guarantee standardisation among users, equality among the citizens and the regions, territorial planning and the long-term continuity of the services provided, as well as a quality standard level. We must, as a matter of urgency, stop this across-the-board liberalisation, which satisfies neither the employees engaged in these activities nor the citizens.

I have always felt that Turkey’s entry into the EU could not be considered within the present context of European integration. I advocate a Europe that is comprised of three circles. The first circle consists of a federal nucleus, with countries that share ambitious social objectives and the desire for a ‘powerful Europe’, a player on the international stage. The second circle groups together the existing 27 countries of the EU. In view of the difficulties and of the crucial need to consolidate this circle, any further enlargement must be ruled out. The third circle must set up a close, global partnership with neighbouring countries in the Balkans, the Mediterranean and elsewhere. I would emphasise the importance of close partnerships with the Mediterranean region that treat Turkey and the Maghreb - as areas of the world with which our Europe has forged long-standing and important links – equally. I therefore abstained from all of the votes except for the one on the recognition of the Armenian genocide, which Parliament has always defended, and I did so to prevent anyone from thinking that I had any reason, in principle, to be prejudiced against Turkey. This is a different view of Europe.

Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, I should like to begin by congratulating Mr Adamou on his report. Many Members have supported the idea of a strategic stockpile of antivirals, and I am delighted that the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Food Safety should have accepted my proposal to implement a compulsory licensing system that should enable us to produce these antivirals more quickly and in far greater numbers so that at least 25% to 30% of the population is covered in each Member State. The stockpile of antivirals is not enough, however. It is crucial that we increase the rate at which the vaccines are produced, because this will obviously be a deciding factor when it comes to limiting the pandemic. I regret that, from this perspective, the Union has not agreed to finance – or, at any rate, my fellow Members have not accepted its financing – a strategic public-private partnership on the subject of speeding up the production of vaccines against avian influenza. My second point relates to antibiotics, which are in danger of running out once the influenza takes hold, because a whole series of complications will occur for which large stocks of antibiotics may prove necessary, mortality being due not only to the influenza, but also to the associated complications. Thirdly, the danger of shortages: if we had to shift to producing extremely large amounts of antivirals in the European Union, the raw materials needed to make the antivirals and the masks could start to run out if the provision of supplies is not guaranteed and diversified. Finally, since avian influenza is merely the first warning sign that major pandemics and epidemics, and particularly viral diseases, are developing on the planet, at a faster rate because of trade, it is altogether crucial that the Union takes the lead when it comes to producing new generation vaccines. My fellow Member, Mr Bowis, just spoke about this. The fact is, the very nature of our vaccines makes it difficult to produce them if we do not have any new strategies available to us. Finally, the WHO needs increased powers of surveillance and control because, from now on, we must be united. The surveillance and control network must be efficient and must operate on a worldwide scale.

 Although I approve of the compromise wording in relation to the directive on nutrition and health claims, which contains a number of improvements – in particular, Article 4 which requires a scientific analysis to be carried out before any health claim is made – I have nonetheless been anxious to vote against all the Amendments (90, 66, and 17) presenting genuine risks to public health. It would be dangerous for food products still to bear claims that, by not presenting the complete picture, could mislead consumers. Thus, it is unacceptable to highlight on a product the words ‘sugar-free’ when this same product might prove to have a high fat content. There is an ever-increasing incidence of obesity in Europe, affecting more and more children. It is vital to fight this scourge by not encouraging people to overeat and by no longer pulling the wool over the eyes of consumers. On the contrary, consumers should be directed towards balanced products.

 I did not approve the broad economic policy guidelines, which, for a number of years, have done nothing but endorse the EU's liberal tendencies and are at the root of the weak growth, unemployment, uncertainty for employees and the withdrawal of our social protections. The report does not support any of the guidelines that would allow an alternative policy: maintenance of purchasing power, revaluation of salaries to revive consumer spending and growth, support for ambitious public investment in modernisation and employment, upward harmonisation of taxation and social standards to combat dumping, and the creation of a real economic government that has weight with the European Central Bank.

Mr President, I wished to draw the European Parliament’s attention to the serious project undertaken by the French Government, which consists of introducing a ‘first job contract’. This is undoubtedly a serious threat to France’s social model, but I understood – and some of my fellow Members will speak on this subject – that threats of this kind exist in many countries in which casual work offering little security is the only solution offered to people, particularly young people, when they enter the world of work. From the perspective of the commitments made via the Lisbon Strategy, whereby our European Union seeks to be the most competitive area in the world at the same time as developing an original social model, it would seem highly appropriate to me that the European institutions call on France not to bring into question a point that was specifically upheld by the International Labour Office, namely that no redundancies should be made without a legitimate reason. Be that as it may, we can observe a great sense of anxiety among our young Europeans about their future, and it would seem important to me that we reaffirm our desire to fight against what is referred to as atypical work and job insecurity.

I voted against this text which, despite being something of an improvement on Mr Bolkestein’s draft, seriously threatens our social model. The country of origin principle is only formally, and not actually, abandoned because the text’s legal vacuum reintroduces it through the back door – (with the de facto application of the Rome Convention and of the proximity principle) – and leaves it to the Court of Justice to deal with any arbitrations that legislators should really take on, applying the host country principle. Services of general economic interest remain within the scope of the directive, a state of affairs that threatens public services, which have already been severely damaged in Europe. The votes confirmed an ultraliberal bias. The Member States are deprived of the resources needed to regulate certain professions and effectively to control the application of the directives such as the one relating to the posting of workers, which is a fragile barrier against social dumping. The European Union needs an alternative draft that includes the upwards harmonisation of social, environmental and consumer protection rules and that excludes public services, which require a protective framework directive.

Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, many employees and citizens of the European Union do not understand the European Commission’s passivity in the face of the hostile TOB affecting the Arcelor
 group and have been deeply shocked by the remarks made by Commissioner Neelie Kroes, who does not see any need for a defence strategy for European groups. She is just happy that there are international groups in Europe. Adopting this attitude means forgetting about our past, namely that Europe was founded on the European Coal and Steel Community. It means disregarding any notion of an industrial policy and it means believing the remarks and the commitments of Mittal Steel
’s boss, which he will clearly go back on in the long term. Proof of this is the closure, in Ireland, of one of this group’s factories despite the commitments that had been made to the local authorities. Finally, I should like to say that, in this industrial policy affair, it is clear that the Mittal Steel
 group is basically aiming to take the Arcelor 
group’s own funds, which are unquestionably the fruit of Arcelor
 employees’ labour; it is also seeking to pave the way for long-term relocations and is thus threatening … (The President cut off the speaker)

Ladies and gentlemen, I should like to make an appeal to the Union’s institutions, be they the Commission, Parliament or the Council, because the Italian Court of Appeal – which is, accordingly, a high judicial authority in Italy – has just considered, in a judgment issued following an act of aggression by an Italian towards some young Colombian girls, that the term ‘dirty nigger’ did not constitute a racist insult, but merely a generic show of hostility. It is pointless telling you that those words are particularly alarming. My colleague who spoke before me brought up the issue of football terraces. For his part, the Italian Minister for Institutional Reform, Mr Roberto Calderoli, believes that immigrants should return to their desert to speak to the camels, and to the jungle to dance with the monkeys – and this from a minister who sits on the European Union’s Council of Ministers! There are, I am afraid to say, a large number of verbal faux pas
, and we must not tolerate them. Something else is taking place here: a judicial institution is clearly underestimating a racist offence. I believe that this is extremely serious as far as our history is concerned. I should therefore like a reaction from our institutions.

Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, the European Parliament has wanted the ban on cadmium and the restriction on the use of this heavy material since 1988. With each piece of legislation, such as those relating to end-of-life vehicles or to electric and electronic products, our Parliament has highlighted one basic principle: the use of cadmium must be prohibited, and this product must only remain in those instances where there is no alternative. Ever since the beginning, that has been the substitution principle, the principle underpinning the draft REACH Directive, which mobilised us some time ago. Like other sectors, the REACH Directive excludes batteries, on the grounds that a suitable directive must precisely enable us to gauge the work done by Parliament. I therefore strongly urge us to apply the substitution principle to batteries containing cadmium. Mr Blokland explained at length the difficulties he had in winning acceptance for an ambitious point of view, and his willingness to make compromises must be welcomed. We support it. Nevertheless, it seems to me that it should be possible for our Parliament to accept a basic principle. If a technology exists on the market that can offer an alternative to nickel-cadmium batteries or to batteries containing cadmium – be they, for that matter, what are known as portable batteries or industrial batteries – then we must ban cadmium. Mr Blokland tried to list what was already available on the market. There are emerging technologies, particularly nickel-zinc technology for industrial batteries. I therefore call on you to accept Amendment 4, tabled by the Socialist Group in the European Parliament, which proposes that, in the event of an alternative technology for industrial batteries appearing on the market, a revision of the directive be got under way. This seems to me to be the absolute minimum requirement if we are to remain faithful to our environmental ambition and, above all, to the desire to promote technological innovation in the European Union.

I have always supported four requirements in the REACH dossier. 1.	An extensive and rigorous system of registration for chemicals in order to recognise them, to evaluate their risk, to give information about them to users and to avoid those that are harmful. 2.	For those products that are harmful to a certain degree, there must be a strict system of authorisation, and the authorisation for their use must be time limited. 3.	The principle of substitution: substitution must be made obligatory for harmful products. If no known substitute exists, research must immediately be instigated and authorisation for use must be limited. 4.	The setting up of a strong European agency that, while being supported by a network of national institutions with expert knowledge, has the final say in implementing this legislation. I voted against the compromise by the Socialist Group in the European Parliament, the Group of the European People’s Party (Christian Democrats) and European Democrats and the Group of the Alliance of Liberals and Democrats for Europe concerning the registration procedure because it reduces considerably the number of substances to which REACH applies.

Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, in order to be credible in the eyes of Europeans, the European Union has to leave its good intentions to one side and act practically by providing itself with ambitions linked to investments. How much money will be allocated to road-rail transport? When will we have trans-European networks, which we are still waiting for? When will we have CAP appropriations for biofuels? When will we see an increase in the research budgets designed to meet the great energy challenges, such as those relating to the hydrogen sector? When will we see the Structural Funds and grants adjusted with a view to energy efficiency and energy saving? I am thinking of the urban environment, housing and social housing. When will we see ecotaxes levied on the carriage of goods, particularly in relation to sea transport? When will we see a regulation of trade from the perspective of the fight against the greenhouse effect? We are waiting for practical and operational responses, laying the ground for immediate action. The European Union must act here and now in order to convince people, in order to serve as an example and in order to form new partnerships with the countries of the South.

Mr President, I will keep this very brief in my one and a half minute’s speaking time. I should like first of all to ask the Commission how it intends to publish the plans due to be drawn up by each of the Member States. Have any deadlines been set to enable all Europeans to read all of the plans made by each country, as well as the concrete guidelines that should be laid down everywhere? Exchanging good practices and decisions needs to be encouraged. Finally, in the event of a pandemic, who will have the say on which decisions need to be taken in order to ensure that the combined efforts are focused in the right direction, that is to say focused on prevention? What will the EU’s powers be, and how can we prevent the buck from being passed between the Member States and the EU in the event of a pandemic occurring? Secondly, the Commission has not seen fit to publish the amount of antivirals currently available in each of the Member States. I do not believe that this lack of transparency is reassuring for people. We need both to know what stocks each of the Member States has and to create a fund of the kind that will enable each of the Member States to have access to as large a stock of antivirals as possible. What do you intend to do in this regard? Thirdly, we do not have a clear strategy as regards employees and other people who come into direct contact with animals and, in particular, with farms on which birds are bred. It would seem to us to be a requirement to have a specific strategy for these employees and other people. Next, do you not consider that it would be useful to coordinate the role of the agencies in order to form a kind of group of experts at EU level who would provide reliable scientific information or, at any rate, come up with a consensus of opinion? Finally, the WHO has just launched an appeal: before we think about a pandemic, let us prevent epizootic disease from spreading! Money is therefore required. Is the European Union ready to give money at international level in order to limit the spread of epizootic disease?

By supporting the principle of Turkey’s entry into the European Union, the European Parliament remains deaf to the voice of the people, who are expressing growing reservations as regards this new enlargement. The time has come to set clear and coherent borders for the Union instead of endlessly forging ahead regardless. No serious political construction – apart from the creation of a single market – can dispense with defining the EU’s territorial outline. In fact, nothing has been undertaken to that end. I have been arguing for years for several circles in the integration of Europe to be created: the first would be a federal circle, which would be very integrated and in which there would be agreement as regards social and fiscal convergence; the second circle would integrate the countries of Eastern Europe and enable our policies to be strengthened at a more progressive rate; and, finally, there would be a circle of cooperation and of close and strengthened partnership in which Turkey would play a full part. Beyond that, I see no reason why we should not treat with the same consideration regions such as the Maghreb, to which a large number of the Member States are united by close links. What is being put to us has nothing to do with this project but confirms the fact that the European project is on its way to being diluted in a vast free trade area.

I shall be voting against the report by Mr Jarzembowski, which establishes a new stage of deregulation for rail transport. The ‘opening up’ of the freight market was already a threat for the public rail services but the shift to opening up passenger services is unacceptable and fraught with consequences for the users and for planning and development in Europe. On the grounds of ensuring an improvement in the organisation of international traffic, the Commission and the report are opening up to competition the most profitable railway lines in each country, thus depriving the public services within the Member States of resources that are essential for tariff averaging and for regional development in relation, for example, to less profitable routes. While in a large number of countries in the European Union, the passenger routes are operated well, this decision will make their future less certain and reduce the governments’ investment capacities.

I have abstained on this report, which does not lay down a pro-active strategy to cope with the seriousness of the situation. I also wish to denounce the climb down of the committee, recorded yesterday in a meeting with the Chinese Government. To derogate from the agreement on the new quotas that was signed only in July and that was in force from 2005 is unacceptable. The commitments made must be respected, and the policy of fait accompli adopted by the large distributors cannot be endorsed, as it would thus put thousands of jobs at risk. The committee has delayed bringing in the import controls needed to launch the safeguard clauses provided for in the WTO and it has not organised itself in order to lay down minimum social and environmental rules in international trade. Today, it refuses to propose a ‘textile plan’ that is equal to the challenges: a shortage of funds for research and innovation, a lack of significant support for technological and social conversion or for training, and no revival of the Euro-Mediterranean area, with common customs duties. Millions of jobs and a still promising industrial sector are being sacrificed by a negligent EU policy.

Madam President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, when the decision was taken to lift restrictions on air transport, very many of us predicted what, unfortunately, is happening today: the decline in safety and the appearance of high-risk carriers, a kind of equivalent to the system of flags of convenience in the maritime transport sector. In any case, rules need to be laid down urgently, and, unfortunately, it is not the first time that our Parliament has insisted on this. Yet, the Member States have often turned a deaf ear. I would insist on four requirements. The first: rules banning high-risk aircraft and carriers, and even the introduction of prior authorisations to be able to take off from, and land on, EU territory. The second requirement: the strengthening of checks in terms of number and quality. The third: the obligation to provide users with information and transparency. Finally, the fourth requirement, which I hope can be included by the Commission, is to improve the level of protection offered to employees who oppose the hazardous operations of their carrier and who should also have the right to withhold their labour.  It has taken a large number of tragedies for the Member States to publish black lists. I believe that everyone here is in agreement in saying that the black lists must be European, and that each time a Member State decides to ban an air carrier, the other Member States must be able to automatically enforce the same ban. I believe that we must go further, however, by calling for a genuine principle of authorisation enabling the European Union, with the European Aviation Safety Agency in particular, to establish whether or not the carrier and the aircraft used comply with our safety rules. I emphasise this point because a large number of circumventions can occur through a change in name and statutes, even when black lists are drawn up. As for the rest, I would emphasise the need to mobilise the Member States, as it has often been Parliament and the Commission that, together, have tried to improve the situation. May the unacceptable and dreadful tragedies that we have witnessed serve as a lesson to those in power in our various countries.

Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I should like, in my turn, to thank Mrs Isler Béguin, our rapporteur, as well as all of my colleagues in the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Food Safety and the shadow rapporteurs, who have endeavoured to present to this House, as my fellow Member, Mrs Gutiérrez-Cortines, has just said, a point of view that is, if I may say so, unanimous or in any case likely to receive majority support. LIFE + and the LIFE programme constitute an extremely important part of our environmental policy, because they are the only budgetary tool that the European Union has released for its environmental policies. It is true that we are often criticised at European level by our fellow citizens for enacting directives, constraints and rules, which is quite legitimate and must be done. Europe has done a great deal for environmental policies, but people often say to us, ‘You impose constraints upon us, but you do not release many funds to support us in implementing the policies concerned’. There are therefore shows of resistance and difficulties requiring the Union to provide financial support for implementing policies. Support tools do exist, such as the integrated policies, on which progress has been made for a number of years. I will come back to that in connection with the Structural Funds and the common agricultural policy. Yet we also require specific tools. The LIFE programme has already shown its effectiveness in many areas. I would stress the need to use LIFE to breathe life into the major framework directives, such as the one on water or our programme to combat the greenhouse effect. Mrs Isler Béguin is, however, right to say that the core issue of our debate is Natura 2000. It is positive that we have succeeded in having Natura 2000 taken into account in the EAFRD. The reality is, however, that a whole series of expenditure, which is vital for managing the geographical area targeted and for implementing the directive, cannot be included here. This is the case for two types of expenditure: those concerning the operation and those concerning certain geographical areas. I am thinking in particular of those areas that are not directly included in agricultural areas 
– wet zones, areas that are slightly separated from them and so on – and that cannot receive funding under mechanisms linked to the Regional Development Fund and the Fund for Rural Development. We therefore need something in addition: we have proposed that 35% of the sum that you, Commissioner, have put at EUR 21 million be devoted to the management of Natura 2000, within the framework of the LIFE programme. I believe in any case that a specific budget attached to LIFE is a determining and essential factor for this House. Furthermore, given that the Commission, since it was newly formed, has always been at pains to tell us that it would pay great attention to the views of Parliament, the wide agreement within Parliament on this issue ought to lead the Commission to support our points of view.

 The true crisis eating away at Europe is unemployment, uncertainty and the destabilisation of public services. The people are reminding their leaders of their existence. Those who voted ‘no’ in France are calling for a major change of direction for European integration and a renegotiation of the Treaty. The pause for reflection must be used for that purpose. The first requirement is social: to create growth and employment without making working conditions too flexible, and without pulling our social model down. The guidelines for growth and employment adopted during this Summit, however, run completely counter to this objective. At a time when employees are demanding guarantees and an end to ultraliberalism, ‘we are carrying on as normal’. We should have withdrawn the Bolkestein directive and the Working Time Directive and proposed a social Treaty in their place. The Council is deaf to the expectations of the people. In order to extricate ourselves from the budgetary deadlock, we must increase the European budget in the interests of revival and cohesion. As long as the budget depends on revenues from the Member States, the blockages will be stronger than the general interest. The alternative to a European tax is European borrowing.

This report has provided the opportunity for a productive collaboration between the three European institutions and industry, resulting in an agreement on environmental needs. Agreement was reached on a fundamental point, the withdrawal of harmful PAH substances and the introduction of safer alternatives. The European Parliament has agreed to grant industry an extra year in order to meet this objective and authorises the sale of existing stocks of which there is not, in the end, a very large quantity. We have here a case in which environmental ambition has boosted research and is enabling this industrial sector, and therefore employment, to be strengthened and the quality of products to be improved. It is therefore possible to draw a conclusion at first reading.

 I voted for Amendment 37 calling for the rejection of this draft directive, which retains the negative points of the previous legislation such as the opt-out and begins the process of dismantling the working time rules. The rapporteur, Mr Cercas, however, is attempting to demonstrate the European Parliament’s intention to secure abandonment of the opt-out, a real poison for the future of European social law, within three years. I think we need to support him in this aim. Nevertheless, I cannot accept that, in return, he is allowing the 48-hour maximum to be calculated over a 12-month period and is allowing working time to be calculated and annualised as employers have demanded, as well as reducing the extent to which time on call is taken into account. This compromise is not satisfactory and is in no way a step forward as we have the right to expect in the European Union. It even includes some backward steps. We are in the early stages of the legislative procedure, and a vote in favour of the Cercas report is nothing more than support for the approach taken towards abandoning the opt-out. Nonetheless, at the end of the codecision stage, I will not approve a working text based on 48 hours.

On the occasion of Mr Markov’s report, I wish to protest against the state of European legislation, which is notoriously inadequate (both in terms of working time, and working conditions and pay) in properly ensuring road safety for all. The European Union has chosen a method that sets possible limits for working time and a few minimum social rules. It does, however, offer the possibility of better regulations in certain Member States. In reality, however, this system causes social dumping, as the free competition of services leads to carriers from countries where there is a better social framework being penalised. As a result, the pursuit of competitiveness exerts pressure, in terms of the deterioration of working conditions and pay in these countries, and this is not acceptable. The European Union ought to have instituted a different process, of upward harmonisation, by a system of progressive social convergence. This strategy ought to have inextricably linked the creation of a base level (one that is more favourable than that used at present) and the obligation for a progressive reconciliation towards the highest level. This is not what is planned, and the situation arising from European legislation cannot be accepted.

 Mr President, I want the European Parliament to speak up for the thousands, indeed millions, of textile workers who see their work threatened by the abolition of quotas within the framework of the WTO. The United States did not tie itself in the same knots as the European Commission when it came to instituting the procedure to safeguard itself against Chinese textile products. The European Commission tells us to wait. According to the Euratex organisation, we shall lose 1 350 jobs per day in the textile sector unless the decision is made to safeguard it. How many unemployed will the Commission have to have on its conscience before it finally deigns to respond?

 I shall be voting against the Commission’s legislative work programme, presented by Mr Barroso, for the following reasons. It says nothing about the withdrawal of the directive on services or of the country of origin principle. It gives no precise commitment for a framework directive on public services. There is no upward fiscal and social harmonisation, and the anti-social trends of the draft ‘working hours directive’ are maintained. It calls for flexibility, for structural reforms to take account of ageing, which will call retirement schemes and labour law into question. Its industrial policy is weak, containing no sectoral plans for sectors such as textiles, nor a strategy to prevent relocation. It lacks ambition in development aid, especially with the creation of a tax on capital movements. It is clear that this programme does not make for the creation of a genuinely social Europe, but will instead pose a threat to the present European social model. It confirms the ultraliberal tendencies of the Barroso Commission.

Mr President, Commissioner, Natura 2000 is one of the major issues that often allow doubts to persist about European construction. Our fellow citizens share our ambition of protecting biodiversity and see that we are producing texts, but when it comes to obtaining funds, Europe does not deliver the goods. Our fellow citizens accept the idea of sustainable development, thinking that it is possible to reconcile protecting the earth with economic development and employment, but when they need the channels and resources to do this, Europe does not deliver the goods. We therefore need to find some new instruments for maintaining Natura 2000. I would like to make three demands: first of all, we need a specific fund, because objectively there is a contradiction between expectations for funds to promote economic development, rural development, and sustaining the land in accordance with Natura 2000. We therefore need a specific fund, which is the first demand. My second demand: the implementation of Natura 2000 needs to be favoured in the criteria for all European funds. I will give you an example to illustrate the contradiction. In the current ERDF regulation that you are in the process of negotiating, the areas are limited to wooded or cultivated areas. Natura 2000 needs natural, untouched land that is not wooded or cultivated, in other words wetlands. Thirdly, we need an instrument for innovation, so that practices on the ground are more in line with what we could provide for in the future. Therefore in Life + we need a specific instrument and we need to maintain two pillars: a general environmental pillar and a pillar for Life Nature, as we had before. As you have understood, Commissioner, as they stand, we do not think that the Commission’s proposals will convince our fellow citizens on the ground. We believe that protecting biodiversity is a step forward, which is compatible with the development of rural areas and the economic future of our country. We therefore now need proof of this conviction, in the form of three billion euros at least from the Structural Funds.

 I am against any further enlargement until the Union has achieved deeper political integration and created a powerful Europe and a social Europe. With each enlargement the prospect of a federal Europe fades. Turkey’s entry will further dilute the European project, and it is not desirable for it to be integrated into the EU in its present form. The issue that will arise for everyone has nothing to do with either religion or geography: the European Union has to be a political project. This project is now under threat because it is being limited to a free-trade area with less and less regulation. We need to overhaul the architecture of Europe and have a federal core, then a Union of 27 countries and then a zone of enhanced cooperation with neighbouring countries such as Turkey, and also other countries like the Maghreb countries, with which we enjoy close links. Approving the opening of negotiations makes this a more distant prospect and continues a policy of ongoing enlargement. Legitimate requirements are made of Turkey, but it goes without saying that if this country meets them it will be impossible to refuse it entry. Before any possible accession negotiations we need to define the future shape of Europe. We should reject enlargement and begin a different kind of cooperation with Turkey.

I am voting against the report on the activities of the ECB. The report endorses the ECB's monetary policy, despite the fact that it is partly responsible for the lack of growth in Europe and for a situation unfavourable to employment. In fact, the ECB has rejected any strategy likely to favour a euro-dollar parity more favourable to exports and industry, in particular with a view to preventing too significant a fall in the dollar. In a similar way, the ECB appears to have refused to tackle parities with currencies such as that of China. These parities hinder our exports and favour relocations (in many cases, this has more to do with the competitiveness of companies than do labour costs). Its attitude makes it clear that the ECB does not have full employment as an objective. I regret that the draft Constitution does not in any way change the situation and allows complete independence to continue without balancing the objectives of price stability and employment. In conclusion, nothing about the situation in the eurozone can justify this blank cheque for the ECB. Inflation has picked up – and whatever some people may have said, the introduction of the euro has unfortunately led to a rise in prices - exchange rates remain high and growth is weak.

For the last vote of this parliamentary term we are being asked to give our verdict on the asylum package. This marks the end of a process carried out throughout this term of office. While some progress has been made, the differences among the Member States unfortunately still exist with regard to the recognition of the status of refugees. Evidence of this is the limits that can be seen in the directive on the reception conditions of asylum seekers. Again, it is the Member States that are on the front line, to the detriment of the European unity that we require in this area. I hope that, during the next parliamentary term, at second reading, we shall be able to reverse this state of affairs in order to create a real European asylum law guaranteeing real protection for these particularly vulnerable men and women.

Thanks to the European Commission’s initiative, which makes it possible to review the directive in force on protection for animals used for scientific purposes, the European Union is able to play a decisive role in the research and development of tests and technologies that do not use animals. The scope of this directive must, moreover, be extended. Some of the amendments tabled by the Committee on Agriculture and Rural Development, against the protection of laboratory animals, were contrary to this objective. It is essential for European research not to suffer because of it; rather, it should be developed. Nonetheless, that must not happen at the expense of animal welfare, or of the development and validation of methods that offer a complete alternative to the use of animals. The development of these alternative methods requires a budget. Moreover, it is essential for the use of non-human primates in research to be progressively phased out, for there to be monitoring for this purpose and for transparency in this matter to be increased.

 Every child has a right to education. The integration of migrants, whether residing legally or illegally, is a priority for us socialists. We do not accept the hierarchy that the parliamentary right wishes to create amongst migrants. This is why I abstained from the vote on Mr Takkula’s excellent report on educating the children of migrants. I did so because, as it is an own-initiative report, it was not possible for us to take separate votes to call for the removal of paragraphs 5, 8 and 16, which I find absolutely unsatisfactory. It is by educating the children of migrants that we will make an important contribution to the integration of all, irrespective of their status. It is by introducing favourable socioeconomic conditions that we will be able to give greater assistance to migrants, whether they reside legally in Europe, or whether they are destined to be granted legal residence or ultimately sent back to their own country. We should not create a status for these children whereby they are not educated and are ghettoised merely because their parents are residing illegally. That is simply contrary to the international conventions.

Mr President, first of all I wish to thank our rapporteur, in particular for the work she has done and the result that has finally been achieved. Article 13 of the Treaty is our cornerstone, and I must emphasise that Member States can guarantee a higher level of protection. It is only a matter of minimum standards and, let us be clear about this, it is not possible to lower the current level of protection in individual Member States on the basis of this new directive. This is because, to be even more precise, some Member States have a very high level of protection; such cases do exist. Freedom from discrimination is a fundamental right for everyone living in the European Union. However, whether it is due to a person’s appearance or simply their surname, we realise that discrimination does all too often exist. As regards people with disabilities, we must ensure that they are no longer discriminated against for using a wheelchair, because access to many places is all too often difficult. Improving European legislation is a prerequisite for combating discrimination – I repeat, it is a prerequisite. We need this legislation. From a very young age our children suffer discrimination that traumatises them, and they carry the burden of this discrimination for the rest of their lives. I must draw your attention in particular to multiple discrimination. The Commission omitted to include this in its proposal. We therefore propose a precise definition of these types of discrimination. It is absolutely essential that we strengthen legislation in order to make equal treatment effective whatever the differences. In this respect we ask for Member States to take measures to promote equal treatment and equal opportunities regardless of religion, disability, age or sexual orientation. In conclusion, I must add that we hope that, for 2010, there will be a Commission proposal putting gender discrimination on the same footing, as this would put an end to any hierarchy of rights.

Madam President, I propose an oral amendment to be inserted after paragraph 1: ‘Demands the immediate and unconditional release of all the aid workers of the Belgian section of Médecins Sans Frontières
 who were kidnapped yesterday from the offices of Médecins Sans Frontières 
Belgium in Saraf Umra, 200 kilometres to the west of El Fasher, the capital of North Darfur’.

Madam President, excuse me, but I do not understand why there should be a time limit. There is no time limit. I repeat: ‘Demands the immediate and unconditional release of all the aid workers’ Is it ‘immediate’ that bothers you?

 President.  
– As regards the draft resolution by the Committee on Foreign Affairs on the humanitarian situation in Sri Lanka, I have received a written objection to the inclusion of the said draft resolution from Robert Evans and 40 other signatories. In accordance with the provisions of Rule 90(4) of the Rules of Procedure, the draft resolution is included for debate and vote on the agenda of the current session. I therefore propose to you that the debate this evening be included as the last item, and the vote will take place tomorrow at 12 noon. The deadline for tabling amendments is 3 p.m. this afternoon.
 President.  
– The next item is voting time. (For details of the outcome of the vote: see Minutes)
 President.  
– I will pass on this request, then, Mr Cashman, and the results will be made known.
 President.  
– Let us clarify matters: there was no objection to paragraph 47 being inserted after paragraph 49. We then voted on Amendment 27, which has been adopted. We could not therefore vote on paragraph 47, as we have voted on Amendment 27. There is therefore no problem.
 President.  
– Ladies and gentlemen, I am, of course, going to tell Mr Nassauer that he is quite correct. Sometimes, however, for democracy’s sake, one has to be able to cross the lines a little. I mean by this, ladies and gentlemen, that I gave the floor to Mr Schulz in accordance with Rule 141 of the Rules of Procedure. He was perfectly entitled to speak.
 President.  
– Mr Prodi, we have adopted Amendment 3, which therefore replaces the whole resolution.

Mr President, SIS II, as we know, is a very important tool for ensuring the security of the Schengen area, especially following the enlargement to include the 10 new countries. Since the adoption of the legal bases in 2007, not once have we had the opportunity to see a detailed report on the developments or on the technical or political problems that are said to be hindering the start-up of the system. It was through the press that we learnt that all the tests required to launch the central system in complete safety had failed in December 2008. We know that the Commission has tried to draw up a remedial plan to resolve the main problems, and we know that several Member States, within the Council, are already thinking of an alternative that would consist of a simple upgrade to the SIS system currently in operation. The problem is therefore not technical, but political. This Parliament has been asked to define by codecision the architecture of SIS II which, of itself, would have ensured the security necessary for our area of freedom, security and justice. We have worked on it without losing sight of security and the protection of the fundamental rights of our citizens. In this instance, it is the political responsibility of the European institutions, and of the Council and the Commission, in particular, that is at stake, for we believe that Parliament has acquitted itself well in relation to the citizens. We await, now and in the future, the political reasons for this radical change of direction. This could, of course, have very serious consequences for the budget earmarked thus far for this project, beginning with the putting aside, where necessary, of the available resources, until such time as the future of the project and its legal basis have been duly defined.

Madam President, I wish first to congratulate our rapporteur for this excellent report as it reveals, rightly, the imbalances which characterise the current asylum law in Europe and he puts forward a number of proposals that will really allow us to move forwards in the right direction. We must put an end to the existing unacceptable disparities between the Member States. In fact, the response an asylum seeker gets depends on the country in which the request for asylum is lodged. We also call for a substantial improvement in the conditions in which asylum seekers are housed. This requires, in particular, the affirmation of the principle that asylum seekers must not be placed in detention, particularly vulnerable persons, women, children and the victims of torture. This also requires guaranteed access to minimum rights to housing, employment, health, education, in other words, to the fundamental rights that ensure the dignity of the person. Finally, for us it is vital that we reform the Dublin II system. Our visits to the detention centres, in particular, have shown us – as you said, Mr Rothe – the collateral damage caused by an unsuitable operation, insofar as it places an unacceptable burden on the countries most directly affected by the flows of migrants towards Europe’s door. There is still a long road ahead of us before we achieve a common policy on asylum. We must not harbour any illusions, but the new Commission proposals, to which I trust we can make an effective contribution, will allow us, I hope, to lay the foundations of a structure which, although it might be fragile today, we hope will be solid in the future. I sincerely thank Commissioner Jacques Barrot for the tenacious will he has shown in this matter, because will is what is needed, and a great deal of will at that. I hope, Commissioner, that you will have the time to implement this work, because it is our duty and a moral imperative for the values that we in the European Union defend.
 President.  
– Ladies and gentlemen, up to now the speakers have kept to their speaking times. We really are pushed for time. I would therefore ask you to please keep to your speaking times.
 President.

Mr President, we have not been able to hold a debate in plenary on this very important report, which is why we feel it is necessary, on behalf of the Committee, to take the floor before you today. We have all worked together, and I commend the outstanding work of the shadow rapporteurs. We visited no fewer than 26 detention centres in 10 EU Member States, and we noted several key points. We observed, in certain centres, an obvious state of decay and an obvious lack of hygiene, and we denounced the failure to respect human dignity. We found that access to healthcare was not always possible and that the children’s right to education was not always respected. We call for respect for clear, fair, effective and proportionate asylum procedures, and we call for the implementation of a permanent system of visits and inspections of detention centres. We must show the reality on the ground and stand up for a right to inspect these centres – something that these kinds of visits permit – and we must do so in order to take action so that things change. The press has asked me why we did not cite any countries in this summary report. I replied that it was my choice, that it was our choice, since we have a collective responsibility with regard to what goes on in detention centres in Europe, and the purpose of this report is not to rank the Member States. We will not stop calling for European solidarity in the area of asylum. We cannot leave the Member States, at Europe’s borders, on their own to face large migratory flows. I repeat once again: we have a collective responsibility. (Applause)

Madam President, you are going to think me bad-tempered, but I feel that such important reports, such important resolutions voted on by so few Members – and it is not those who are here, of course, who are to blame – frankly, I find the situation hopeless and, really, I do question our credibility. Therefore, personally speaking, I will not be able to accept there being so few of us for much longer, and, at some point, the question will have to be asked as to whether there should be a quorum. I am well aware that there have to be 40 Members before a quorum may be requested. Since there are just over 40 of us, this is difficult, but I still think that something will have to be done.

 Mr President, the right to consular and diplomatic protection is one of the pillars of European citizenship. Minister, you cited Article 20 of the Treaty. It is very clear. Every citizen has the right to consular protection. It is not an option, it is a right. The dramatic events in Mumbai show us, in actual fact, that this right is far from being guaranteed. Levels of protection vary from Member State to Member State, resulting in discrimination in the treatment of citizens who are never given information about the consulate to contact in the event of need. Financial support is visibly lacking between the Member States. European citizens who have lost everything must often face consular offices that are very reluctant to bear the financial costs. Member States have a duty to put an end to this situation. It is necessary to make guidelines binding and to make information available to citizens. The Union must start negotiations with third countries in order to ensure the necessary diplomatic protection. However, as you said, Commissioner, the events in Mumbai have also shown the unacceptable absence of a guarantee of diplomatic protection for Members of the European Parliament. The European Union and the Commission in particular must negotiate without delay, and we heard what you told us, Commissioner, and the Council must conclude ad hoc agreements with third countries in order to ensure specific diplomatic protection for Members of the European Parliament. This is the least we can do.

 Mr President, since 2005, we have been greatly moved by the catastrophic situation of the migrants held on the island of Lampedusa, whose numbers are well in excess of its real accommodation capacity. The situation is difficult for this small island which, in 2008 alone, had to cope with the arrival of almost 31 700 immigrants. These massive flows have been brought under control in recent years as these migrants have been sent to other centres on the Italian mainland. These transfers were interrupted following a decision taken by the Minister for the Interior and we are seeing a serious deterioration in the situation. However, the Presidium project, which is jointly managed by the Ministry of the Interior, the High Commissioner for Refugees and the Italian Red Cross and part-funded by the Union, has become an example of good management of migrant reception. The decision to end the transfers to Italy is creating a real problem of access to asylum procedures. As for Mayotte, since 2007, we have known that the nominal capacity of the Pamandzi centre has been exceeded. It became known that 204 people, generally minors, were being housed there, while the maximum capacity is for 60 people. The current conditions are catastrophic: the men are sleeping on the floor; there is no distribution of any bedding or toiletries and men, women and children have to use the same lavatories. The detention conditions are degrading and an affront to human dignity. The pressure of migration is indeed felt more strongly in these territories, but the dignity of each person must be ensured and each case should be investigated in accordance with the law. It has already been stated that we have an unavoidable need for a real European policy on asylum and immigration and for solidarity at the Union level. We have been making this request to the European Parliament for several years and we are therefore making a fresh appeal to the Council.

The conflict between Israel and Gaza has simply gone on too long. When deaths are now being counted in their thousands, it is our overriding duty to ensure the fighting stops immediately. The policy of isolation of Gaza has failed, radicalising the population who have been its first victim. No military solution to the Israeli-Palestinian conflict is possible. The only possible settlement is a lasting and comprehensive peace settlement between the parties. That is why we are asking for an international conference, instigated by the Quartet and with the participation of all the stakeholders in the region, to be organised as soon as possible, on the basis of the Arab League Initiative, the previous agreement between the Israelis and Palestinians. Meanwhile, we think that any upgrading of political relations between the EU and Israel must be strictly conditional upon respect for international humanitarian law. We therefore remained opposed to the vote in support of Israel’s increased participation in Community programmes.

There can be no European area of freedom, security and justice without the protection of fundamental rights. Europe has a duty to set an example and to be irreproachable in this matter. Violations have been identified, revealed, including for example in closed establishments accommodating children and elderly people. There is also the eternal problem posed by the disastrous situation of some prisons, as the report that we have today voted in favour of highlights. We must also fight to ensure that social rights are recognised. Poverty and job insecurity are attacks on human rights. How can we accept a situation where people have work and yet cannot afford a place to live, in Europe and in the 21st century? We must proclaim the fundamental rights of each and every one of us. The European Union is endowed with a Charter of Fundamental Rights. Let us make sure that it is respected!

− Mr President of the Republic of Latvia, the right honourable Valdis Zatlers, it is a very great pleasure for us all to be able to welcome you today on your first visit to the European Parliament. I should like to start by thanking you, as the President of a country which is still a relatively new Member State of the European Union, for accepting the European Parliament’s invitation to address us today, the day on which we are celebrating the 10th anniversary of our common currency, the euro. Today is a premiere in every sense of the word, as this was the first time that the European hymn has been played to welcome a guest to plenary here in the European Parliament. (Applause)
 May I take this opportunity to mention once again today the historic significance of the enlargement of the European Union in 2004. It took over 60 years to bring your country back into a free and democratic Europe and unify our continent. We live today in peace, freedom and democracy. Our citizens enjoy prospects that our forefathers could only have dreamed of. We must and should rejoice in that. It is true that today the European Union faces new and serious challenges. Even the people of Latvia have come to feel this quite clearly, for example as a result of the financial crisis, which has also hit your country hard, Mr President. The gas crisis between Russia and Ukraine is also giving the citizens of Latvia justified cause for concern. It is precisely in times of crisis that we understand the value of membership of a European Union based on the principle of solidarity between its peoples. It is precisely in this time of crisis that we all feel the need for community and cooperation between our countries and the European institutions. Together we are stronger, together we can defend our interests and values better throughout the world. That is also why the European Parliament hopes the Lisbon Treaty, which gives the European Union a stronger capacity to act to overcome these serious challenges, will shortly enter into force. In this respect, the European Parliament elections due to take place in June this year are immensely important, because we want to push ahead with the success story of the European peace and unification project together, in a democratic European Union with a European Parliament with codecision powers in nearly every area. I truly hope that the citizens of Latvia – and of all the other Member States of the European Union – will understand that their vote is important because it gives them European powers of codecision and in this sense will turn out in force during the forthcoming elections to the European Parliament. Mr President, it gives me great pleasure to invite you now to address the European Parliament. May I warmly welcome you once again to the European Parliament. (Applause)

Mr President, when the regulation on security features and the inclusion of biometric details in European passports was adopted in 2004, the Member States did not envisage any derogation from the obligation to provide fingerprints. Current experience shows that the existing technology still does not ensure that the fingerprints of children under the age of 12 are reliable enough to allow them to be used as a security feature in passports. I therefore welcome the compromise found with the Member States to set 12 as the age limit for the collection of biometric data, and which includes a clause for revision in three years. On our side, we have accepted this derogation for those Member States that have already adopted legislation for children over the age of six. The use of this type of data would only be acceptable if it truly offered protection to our children. That is not yet the case. We remain, however, open to any positive changes in the technology in this field. Our priority is to ensure the safety of children travelling alone to avoid kidnapping and trafficking of children. The inclusion of this data in passports gives a false sense of security as it does not prevent a child from crossing a border without parental consent. The compromise found with the Member States will allow the Commission to present a report on the requirements for minors travelling alone across external borders. This report will thus allow initiatives to be proposed that will guarantee a European approach to the rules protecting minors when they cross external borders of the Member States. Finally, the biometric data in passports must only be used to verify the authenticity of the document and the use of sensitive personal data such as biometric details is only acceptable in conjunction with strict data protection rules.

 President.  
– The next item is Question Time (B6-0001/2009
). We are going to deal with a series of questions addressed to the Commission.
 President.  
–  Subject:	Ten years of the euro In light of the recent celebrations to mark the tenth anniversary of the adoption of the euro, can the Commission comment on the key lessons learnt in terms of the coordination of fiscal policy across the euro area, especially in light of the recent financial and economic crisis?
 President.  
–  Subject:	Collapse in dairy prices on the EU market According to a Commission working document dated 21 November 2008 on monitoring price trends, annexed to the communication on food prices in Europe (p. 9), between October 2007 and October 2008 the price of butter on the EU market fell by 30%, while that of powdered milk decreased by 40%. Both prices thus appear to be descending unstoppably towards the intervention levels. Does the Commission believe that the content of its proposal drawn up a year ago on raising the milk quotas, as approved by Parliament and the Council, should be maintained unchanged in the face of these market trends? Does the Commission believe that the limits existing under the current rules as regards intervention for powdered milk and butter are likely to be sufficient to prevent disastrous consequences for farmers’ incomes, as in a region like the Azores where farmers’ activity is totally dependent on the market in dairy products such as those mentioned?
 President.  
–  Subject:	Microcredits In May 2008 Commissioner Mariann Fischer Boel proposed reallocating EU funding that was previously used for export subsidies, price support and the storage of surpluses to microcredits, to enable farmers in the developing countries to buy seed and fertiliser. Microcredits are unquestionably a major aid in combating poverty and an instrument for achieving the millennium goals. Back in April 2008 Parliament called in a Written Declaration for more resources to be released for microcredit projects. What practical action has the Commission so far taken to follow up that proposal?
 President.  
– Mr Allister, I was not at all aware that you had a question to ask. If I had known, I would of course have given you the floor.
 President.  
– I am sorry, according to my staff, no one saw you.
 President.  
–  Subject:	Reforming the budget The outcomes of the Commission’s public consultation on ‘Reforming the budget – Changing for Europe’ called for the Commission to enhance the effectiveness and efficiency in the delivery of the budget by increasing transparency and public access to it. In addition to this the recent publication of the Court of Auditors’ Report 2007 made various recommendations in terms of cost/risk balance, monitoring and reporting, simplification of instruments, and improving the information and control provided by Member States. Can the Commission comment on what steps it will take to address the main results of the public consultation and the Court of Auditors’ Report in terms of increasing performance and minimising administrative burdens?
 President.  
–  Subject:	EU budget reform Is the Commission satisfied that the recent public consultation ‘Reforming the Budget, Changing Europe’ reflects the view of the majority of European citizens; or is the ‘one message’ gathered from ‘hundreds of voices’ really reflective of the whole of EU opinion? What are the key conclusions that can be drawn and what does the Commission consider will be the big shifts in EU spending in the future? Specifically, what does the Commission expect to be the key reforms of spending on agriculture?
 President.  
–  Subject:	Cybercrime With ongoing advances in technology and more and more people using the Internet, it is becoming increasingly difficult to police the Internet. What is the Commission doing to fight against cybercrime at EU level?
 President.  
–  Subject:	Terrorist threats We saw last November the terrorist attacks in Mumbai, where many EU citizens’ lives were threatened. In light of the Madrid and London bombings in 2004 and 2005 respectively, it is clear that we are under threat from similar attacks on the EU. Can the Commission tell us what we are doing to strengthen and enforce information exchange between Member States’ police forces to respond to such attacks?
 President.  
–  Subject:	EU immigration policy Given that EU immigration policy should have a major humanitarian element and guarantee respect for human rights; that it should help promote integration measures rather than repressive measures, and likewise measures designed to put the rights and obligations of immigrants on an equal footing with those of nationals and to encourage cooperation between the Member States and between the latter and the countries of origin; that it should promote solutions which strengthen intercultural dialogue and respect for differences, for minorities and for freedom, and whereas the French Republic has already signed protocols with various African countries, specifically Congo-Brazzaville, Tunisia, Benin, the Mauritian Islands, Senegal and Gabon, with a view to encouraging development and the possibility of legal immigration, what back-up and support has the Commission provided for those Member States which wish to initiate such processes?
 President.  
– Questions which have not been answered for lack of time will be answered in writing (see Annex
).
 President.  
–  Subject:	Opening up of ‘closed’ professions In pursuit of the single market objective of the free movement of persons, goods and services, the Commission is encouraging the opening up of ‘closed’ professions in those Member States where they exist, which in general terms is a move in the right direction. Are there cases in which the closed professions could remain so, provided they successfully serve society as a whole by providing services without creating problems? What are the possible negative repercussions of opening up some closed professions? Has the Commission carried out studies into the impact on local communities, particularly in regions with specific features (e.g. mountain and island regions, etc.)?
 President.  
–  Subject:	Credit rating agencies The Commissioner responsible for the internal market and services, Mr Charlie McCreevy, recently stated the following in connection with the regulation of credit rating agencies. ‘I want Europe to play a leading role in this sector. This proposal goes further than the rules existing in any other jurisdiction. These very exacting rules are necessary to restore the confidence of the market in the ratings business in the EU.’ Will the Commission say why it did not propose the adoption of a more exacting regulatory framework at the stage preceding the financial crisis?

 Mr President, Commissioner, many of us here have just had the pleasure of hearing you announce a number of positive developments that have never been mentioned before, and which will no doubt appear in the communication from the Commission to the European Parliament and to the Council, which we look forward to receiving. However, your response gave the impression that there was no complete recognition of the fact that events are snowballing. First of all, the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change, with a scientific consensus which is now shared, has told us that the Arctic faces greater threats than those imagined only four or five years ago. The living conditions of the Inuit people are under threat, and biological diversity is in danger. Many species, including polar bears, are also threatened. Secondly, this summer, for the first time in several millennia, the Arctic sea route was navigable from the east and west. That has never happened before. We have also had the recent announcement of oil slicks, degasification and oil damage in the Arctic. Thirdly, my fellow member from the PPE has just this instant reminded us that a Russian submarine planted a Russian flag at the North Pole. What was this supposed to mean? Russia is claiming the expansion of its maritime zone to include its entire continental shelf. That represents 38% of the entire surface of the Arctic. It is a terrible situation because it is the prelude to the militarisation of the Arctic. The only way, Commissioner, of blocking this procedure, which is being examined by the United Nations Commission on the Limits of the Continental Shelf, is to commence negotiations for an international protection treaty. This has never been mentioned before. With Greenland and Denmark, the European Union has one country that borders the Arctic region and two other countries that are situated in Arctic territory. We have close ties with Iceland. The European Union has the power to ask it – and I believe that there is an urgent need for this, both in the interests of security and in the interests of the policing of shipping and climate preservation – to continue initiatives which could produce surplus energy. We need to begin negotiations now for an Arctic protection treaty, as there is for Antarctica. I know this because I was one of the sponsors of those negotiations. It is with this in mind that I propose swift action. There is no time for delay. This has to happen before the UN committee finishes examining Russia’s claim.
 Michel Rocard,  
draftsman of the opinion of the Committee on Foreign Affairs
. – (FR)
 Madam President, Mr President-in-Office, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, the Committee on Foreign Affairs, which I represent as draftsman, is in favour of all these efforts. It is concerned about Africa and it supports everything that has been said. It only wants to know whether we are really bold enough for the task. What we cannot write, although our report suggests it and indeed I am able to say it, is that when it comes to Africa there is a lot of politically correct and asphyxiating hypocrisy that has to be got rid of before we can really achieve our objectives. As regards enabling Africa to develop by allowing its products access to our markets, it must be remembered that some forty African countries have nothing whatsoever to export. This slogan is quite simply dishonest. Not a single African country is self-sufficient in foodstuffs. They have to import to eat, while exports from here and from Brazil are killing off the local subsistence agriculture. We have to help Africa to protect itself. This is the message that we have repeated in the report. Of course corruption acts as a destructive blight on Africa. Yet this problem is endemic in extremely poor countries. We therefore need to start with the big fish and focus on them. This means the usual well-known suspects, even if they are ministers, and those on our own side who engage in bribery. Small-scale corruption will only disappear with economic development. Let us not start accusing them of the very same things we were doing a few centuries ago, for our expansion and development too were based on corruption. Finally, a dictatorship cannot become a democracy even with the help of trade and foreign aid. However, it can become an enlightened despotism. Putting an end to torture and abduction, allowing freedom of expression and establishing the independence of the courts and their control over the police all have to take priority over the pluralist elections that are organised simply to please the West, while all the time they are abducting people and murdering journalists and election candidates. The conditions that we impose should take account of these factors. There is still much to be said on this subject.
 Michel Rocard  (PSE

 Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, I am sorry that the Council is not represented in our debate this evening because for once it is our main contact. The atmosphere here is euphoric, everyone is in agreement and tomorrow we are going to vote – by a crushing majority, I think – for the ratification of this amendment to the TRIPS agreement, which is supposed to provide and should provide better access to medicines for countries that are not sufficiently developed and do not have a pharmaceutical industry that allows them this access. What happened during the long debate we have had on this, is that Parliament was a little more doubtful than the Commission about the efficacy of this system. I believe – and I would like to thank the Council here for having listened to Parliament more than the Commission, for once – that this is what led to the statement distributed on Monday morning, thanks to which we have accepted that an agreement between us enables us to make this small step forward. It is an improvement, but it is an improvement the inadequacy of which we are aware of and regarding the effectiveness of which we have a few doubts. These few doubts need to be removed by the stringency with which the Member States and the Council apply the recommendations. I am delighted, however, by what has just been said by Mr Mandelson, who has himself announced a group of experts to find other measures, and an evaluation of these measures, and I think we will be discussing these matters again once we have seen whether the effectiveness meets our expectations. In any case, I am pleased about the positive conclusion to this necessary stage, even if it does not go far enough.

Mr President, I think this amendment is superfluous in the light of the letter received by the United Nations from the Government of Chad on 11 September 2007, expressing the Government’s agreement. I have here a photocopy of the letter and I quote: ‘the Government of Chad welcomes the new recommendations of the Secretary-General of the United Nations, contained in his report of 10 August 2007, with a view to the deployment of an international presence in eastern Chad in order to contribute [...]’ and so on and so forth. The amendment thus serves no purpose. The agreement is in writing and is accessible to anyone who wishes to read it. I am quite taken aback because I sent a copy of the text to Mr Gahler. I therefore propose that we vote against the amendment.

Madam President, Commissioner, Mr President-in-Office of the Council, I am satisfied with this draft resolution and with the decision that it upholds and I would also like to say something else: when man’s brutality leads to tragedy and suffering on the scale that we have seen in Darfur, then our conscience demands solidarity. I am profoundly pleased that the European Union is responding to the appeal made by the Secretary-General of the United Nations. Many Members and diplomats, including my friend and colleague Mrs Gomes just now, have stressed that this operation must under no circumstances be allowed to look like an opportunity to support French interests or to extend France’s military presence in the region. I hope that I am surprising no one when I too give my vigorous support to this view. Speaking as a former Prime Minister, may I say with some conviction that if France is still present in this region it is simply because of her significant historical heritage, where the burden of colonialism has been such that a policy of solidarity with the people is needed to try to help them regain peace and stability and to herald the start of effective governance. France no longer has any strategic or economic interests in these regions and I am one of those who would have preferred to see us withdraw a long time ago: that would have saved a lot of money and would really have been in our own interest. Even the uranium resources of the Niger do not constitute a strategic interest of kingly proportions, but simply require sufficient peace and stability so that these deposits can be made accessible to everyone and a competitive market can be established. This then is essentially a European peacekeeping operation, not a French one, and that is the way it should be. I would add a word of warning, however: this vision will only be made reality if a large number of European Member States agree to send troops. It would be damaging if the spirit of solidarity, which for historical reasons has placed greater demands on France than on others to the extent that we have the largest contingent, were to be turned by your absence into a climate of post-colonial suspicion. That would be senseless and I would take great exception to it. Let me end with the following remark. The oral amendment tabled this morning by our fellow Member Mr Gahler is for once – sadly for him – not relevant. The Republic of Chad, by way of its Foreign Minister, gave its agreement in principle to this operation in a written communication that was sent to the Security Council several days ago. I have a photocopy of this document here and I will be happy to make it available to Mr Gahler.

 Mr President, I should like to commend the willpower of the Minister and of the Commissioner: I know what it is like to attend debates without being able to leave the room, and I hope they will not be too bored. I come now, with this debate, to a topic that is rather a new one for us. The title of the report is not appropriate. It is not so much about the European Union’s relationship with reforms in the Arab world as about a relational process of the European Union with the Arab world for the purpose of facilitating reforms. For the sake of speed, I shall set out my comments as a number of points. The first point, as you all know, is that all is not well in the various Arab states. We all receive vast amounts of information and hear complaints about failure to observe human rights, about often dictatorial governments, about huge, scandalous financial inequalities in the various countries and about the lack of economic take-off, even in places where there is oil. There is indeed a malaise in the Arab world. A Lebanese Arabic writer even spoke about an Arab malaise. Behind this malaise, there is a long history of humiliation: colonialism, independence, lack of control of resources, of oil in particular, intellectual decline and, as a result, a corresponding rise in religious fundamentalism. My second point is that it is in this context that belonging to the Arab world is perceived in most of these countries as an awareness of identity, a search for collective empowerment. That developed in the second half of the 20th century and particularly towards the end. Now, it is the League of Arab States which, internationally, is taking a stand on behalf of the different States and is being respected. It is the League’s resolutions that have brought about some progress in what is called the Middle East peace process, which is still not a peace process but from which it is hoped some results will emerge through the Arab League Summit. There is also, thanks to the media, something of a growth in Arab public opinion that is much more homogeneous than the diplomatic positions of the various States. It is also at the pan-Arab level that many intellectuals, especially Egyptians, but also Lebanese, even Algerians, pitch their message, rather than within their national context. Finally, it has to be said that the Arab League has never had to deal with religious problems. They are referred to the Organisation of the Islamic Conference, which is a different world. Arab identity is a secular concept, which can make our relationship easier. My third point is: how do we, the European Union, deal with this Arab identity? By ignoring it. We have a strong, dense relationship with Iraq, and talk about it a great deal. We deal with the Israel-Palestine conflict, making very little reference to the preceding one. We speak about Algeria. We have strong bilateral relationships with Algeria, Morocco, Tunisia and Egypt, too. In short, we have relationships with all these countries that are of the public, state, bilateral kind, but we ignore the fact of their Arab identity. The question that this own-initiative report puts to the Commission and to the Council is this: is there not good reason to move away from that and to do a bit more, in the light of the observations I was making in my second point? There is now an intellectual life, a political life and a diplomatic life in the Arab world at the level of its community. Is it not in the European Union’s interest to establish relations at this level also? The numerous standstills that we find in the Arab world, which are of course economic, financial, political, institutional and religious, are also to a large extent intellectual and cultural. It is through intellectual and cultural relations that other relations will develop, and the purpose of this report is to suggest that we take note of that. Firstly by recognising that Arab identity is compatible with democracy and with modernity, even if the facts do not demonstrate it. There is, intellectually and politically, and in the speeches of the League, a real possibility. It is, moreover, the Arab League which, by slightly forcing the hand of many of its Member States, has produced an Arab Charter on Human Rights. We all know that it is not a great advance, that it is well behind our own European Convention on Human Rights and the Universal Declaration on Human Rights. Nonetheless, it is real progress compared with the situation we had a short time ago. And then, in the face of the great contemporary problem of the fight against terrorism, I think that we all wish to reach a relationship of complicity and alliance with the Arab nations against extremists and killers, rather than to condemn them all and to make this fight impossible. It is in this context that the report suggests that we, the European Union, should strengthen our relations with everything that has a collective character in this matter: of course, the League of Arab States, but also, why not, the Gulf Cooperation Council and even the Arab Maghreb Union, if it were to be revived. Through these bodies, it is possible to develop a network of cultural and intellectual relations and to organise discussion seminars, which will bolster our support for the reforms. This report, Mr President, is somewhat subtle. We are extending the hand of friendship to countries about which there is seemingly much to criticise. Our amendments debate will be between the extremism of the condemnations and the moderation of the hand of friendship which, while indeed recognising that there are strong criticisms to be made, would prefer to keep quiet about them as long as this hand of friendship can contribute to a process of reform that we all need.

Mr President, Mr Gloser, Mr Verheugen, in only two minutes, I shall not be able to reply to everybody. I should like first to stress the importance that has led four of our speakers not to deal with the subject directly but to remind us that, before this topic, the unresolved tragedy of the Israel-Palestine conflict, the non-recognition of the new Palestinian Government and the different obstacles that we put in the way, hinder good relations between Europe and the Arab world. They are right. That was not my point. I wish to support this point of view very forcefully. I have often supported it on other occasions. I would draw your attention to the fact that therein lies the key. I should also like to commend the great understanding of the report’s approach, which has been as evident in Mr Gloser’s speech as in that of the Commissioner, Mr Verheugen, and I do not think that his successor will say otherwise: there exists a convergence of thinking between a parliamentary approach, which I represent here, and the perception of the Council of Ministers, as well as that of the Commission. For me, that is absolutely essential. To our colleagues on the different benches, I shall simply say that the contribution made by Mr Busuttil’s, who supports the idea of partnership, seems important to me. I would say that Mr Cappato is right to emphasise that we wish, through all these efforts, to engage with civil societies, to engage, ultimately, with individuals, of course, but we cannot engage with individuals alone, we have to do so through institutions, the media, etc., and that is indeed the approach of this report. Mr Tajani focused on reciprocity. I too am concerned about reciprocity. I should like to point out that the intelligence of our approach will depend on our ability to adjust reciprocity according to the inequalitiy of the levels of economic and cultural development. The point is to support a process that must bring Arab countries closer to the values of our democracies, without pretending and without accusing them of not sharing these values from the beginning of the process. That is what brings me, as Mr Cappato well knows, to defer certain amendments, not because I disagree with some of the criticisms, but rather because I disagree that it is opportune to bring them up now, at a time when we are engaging in a process of holding out a hand to help people who are way behind us when it comes to respect for human rights. A support process does not presuppose that the problem has been resolved in advance. We will not increase our demands. I would even be tempted, in this spirit, to encourage voting against an amendment tabled by my own group. We have discussed it fully. My group is inflexible on some intangible principles for which I have been fighting for 50 years. In this matter we must progress more moderately. I propose that we use subtlety in our diplomatic relations. In politics, subtlety is rare, but I am suggesting it all the same. (Laughter)

Mr President, Commissioner, there are not very many of us in this Chamber, which does not mean to say that we are not deliberating serious issues – far from it. I am going to address you on behalf of three political groups and of even more than that, just as my fellow Member and friend, Mr Lehne, also did. Commissioner, this debate is due to the initiative of the European Parliament and it was born out of our desire to respond positively to your consultation. We thank you for it and we congratulate you on it. After the difficulties that we encountered concerning the patentability of software, we were pleased that the Commission – with you yourself acting as intermediary - is launching a procedure aimed at restarting discussions and preparatory work on the European patent. Commissioner, we clashed swords; we disagreed on several points. I have just listened to you extremely carefully. I can say that I agree with virtually everything you just said. I totally agree, but there is one argument that you have not mentioned, and, because of your silence, that is the one that I am led to wonder about and that, while we are still without a solution, currently leaves those that I represent in a rather negative state of uncertainty. Let me explain myself a little more. All of us in this Chamber, as Europeans, want the Community patent. I have that in common with my fellow Member and friend, Mr Lehne, who just spoke with his customary eloquence. We all know that this patent has come up against enormous difficulties and that it is at a standstill. The main reason for this standstill is language-related. In reality, the four factors causing this standstill are the language problem, the cost problem, the problem of the legal consistency of the judicature and the sovereignty problem - the one about which you have not spoken. I truly believe that the real means of breaking the political, cultural and intellectual deadlock at the Council regarding the European patent is mainly connected with solving the language problem. Unlike my fellow Member, Mr Lehne, I am not just a European Member who is in favour of Europe; I am also French. Nobody is perfect, you will forgive me for that. I should like to state in this House that I believe that the ratification of the London agreement – something that my country has not yet officially endorsed, although I advise it to do so – would be an opportunity for us all to overcome our linguistic arrogance and the hostility that it creates and to learn to live together, in the knowledge that one language dominates the others worldwide. We may not like it, but that is how things are; it is convenient. That is what would potentially break the deadlock on the start of plans for a Community patent. We would therefore agree to the resolution resulting from these debates saying so. The second problem is one of cost; I will hardly touch on it, except to say that three-quarters of the cost factor are language-related – that is the problem that I am going to address – and that the remaining quarter is modest, that the EPLA probably needs to be improved and that it is outrageous to think that we might see the ratification of an agreement that many experts say would increase costs. We do not need that. The only problem about which you have not spoken is that of knowing which legislative sovereignty will define and develop over time the field of what is patentable and what is unpatentable. This Parliament will be extremely sensitive to anything to do with the patentability of living matter, which is a significant problem for civilisation. Moreover, as regards software, we cannot ratify the EPLA, because the EPLA gives a professional group of judges a partly international, partly European function: that of making changes to the case law as they see fit, without any legislative control or sovereignty having a bearing on their actions. This is what we do not accept: the idea that European sovereignty will play no part in defining the scope. Therefore, since the EPLA is a body of autonomous jurisdictions blocking and holding up the implementation of the European patent, we reject the EPLA and we advise you … (The President cut off the speaker)

Mr President, Commissioner, for 30 years now, the wealthy countries have been unable to fulfil the commitment they made before the UN to increase their development aid to 0.7%. This is a scandal, and we are all here to search for new ideas. I find it very regrettable that the Commission should have so few of them, and that the communication that you have been asked to read should be so flimsy. You did not even mention the British idea of a tax on the movement of capital. You only mentioned a French idea of a tax on the movement of aeroplanes. In this quest for new ideas, allow me to propose another one to you. I believe that it was in its document issued in April 2005 that the Commission proposed the idea of a global lottery. Mr Michel, whom I myself questioned during a sitting in this very Chamber, acknowledged that this was an option. You did not even take it up. Commissioner, I think that the option of a global lottery is easier to follow through than many other options. The World Food Programme, which took up this idea with the aim of looking into it further, concluded that, on the basis of an estimated minimum of 1% of our countries’ turnover being spent on each draw, four draws per year would raise an annual sum of USD 400 million, which the World Food Programme proposes allocating to the measures aimed at preventing children in the world from starving. Why did not the Commission put its own stamp on this idea? I take no pleasure whatsoever in searching for a solution outside our budgets: our countries should be quite serious about doing what they say they are going to do, but given that they are incapable of keeping their promises, this new idea at least has the virtue of not bothering anyone and of being unrestricted, if, in each of the Member States, it is the legislative authority that allocates this share of the profit to the World Food Programme instead of to the local State authorities. Setting up a global lottery is an easy thing to do. I therefore suggest to the Commission that it take the initiative in setting up the lottery and firmly encourages our Member States to implement it.

 Mr President, Commissioner, the absence of peace in the Middle East is having increasingly dangerous consequences: threats to destabilise the Palestinian community and risks connected with Iran’s aggressive behaviour, scarcely tempered by anxieties about Syria. I appreciated the relative optimism of your opening words, Commissioner, but I think that things which go without saying are better said and I would like to help strengthen the grounds for optimism. The media are taking the view that, in the present situation, the disappearance of Ariel Sharon presages disaster and that the outlook is quite frightening. Indeed, Sharon seemed to be the only person capable of seeing through the astonishing process of unilateral partition that he had devised as a preparatory stage to peace. I really would like to stress that this is no time to panic. Contrary to the impression given by the media, great men do not make history on their own: institutions and situations have their part to play. On the Israeli side, there have for a very long time been two political obstacles to any prospects of peace. The first is that in the eyes of many Israelis and of Ariel Sharon, all processes of the Oslo, Taba or Geneva kind fail to take adequate account of the imperative of Israeli security. The second is that Israel’s largest right-wing group, Likud, has never, ever, in any way agreed to make the slightest concession whatsoever on its vision of Israel’s future, a vision of Biblical Israel, ‘Eretz Israel’
 or ‘Greater Israel’, on the pretext of exchanging land for peace. Before he was taken ill, Ariel Sharon had removed both those obstacles. He had removed the first one by making visible and beginning to carry out a plan aimed at achieving peace gradually by partition. Many of us in this Parliament, Commissioner, do not like that plan. Too much violence, not enough talks, and a Palestinian state much reduced in size into the bargain. It is the only plan there is, however, and it has won over many Israelis, because it was the first to marry the absolute imperative of security with the prospect of peace. The second obstacle was removed because Ariel Sharon had the extraordinary courage to break with Likud. Even if Sharon has gone, a large new party has been born representing a section of the Israeli right that is willing to move towards peace because its mind has been put at rest. Tomorrow, that party may be the dominant force in the Knesset and join with other forces from the centre and the left. The party’s doctrine and that of its leader Ehud Olmert are not focussed on negotiation, but only on withdrawal from the occupied territories. We know that. Nevertheless, Commissioner, the partisan mechanics of the Knesset can only move in the direction of deepening the split with Likud and of rapprochement with the parties of Amir Peretz and Schlomo Ben-Ami: Sharon or no Sharon, the necessary break has been made and the inevitable will follow. The Israelis sense this and are showing it in the polls. Not only must we not over-dramatise at this time, we must stand firmly behind this process, because even though the Palestinian community is strongly influenced by Hamas it will quite obviously follow. Peace, Commissioner, is today’s promised land and Moses, too, died before he could enter it. (Applause from the left)

Mr President, Commissioner, unlike the previous speaker, I, like many of us, remain convinced that Turkey’s accession to the Union is essential for guaranteeing reconciliation, peace and security in the entire region, for contributing to the effort to make it a democratic and developed country and above all, perhaps, for demonstrating to a Muslim country that, if it respects human rights, there is a place for it in a Union of democratic countries. The task, however, is a very difficult one, as this debate shows, since hostile forces exist that are gaining ground and striving to see this process end in failure. Mr President, Commissioner, what we have here is a textbook case illustrating the political difficulty involved in taking decisions that are burdened with complications in the short term and whose positive results it will only be possible to appreciate in full 10 or 15 years later. That is why I urge you to grant a great deal of importance and to devote a lot of time to the task of explaining. You have to publicise the difficulties, of course, such as this unilateral Turkish declaration on Cyprus that has just been mentioned, as well as the recent cases of people being sentenced for their opinions. Yet, we must also emphasise the progress made and the reason for the delays. With this in mind, I cannot but believe that the declaration on Cyprus, which we regret, is a response from Turkey, long-awaited by its people, to the refusal of the UN draft by the Greek Cypriots. That does not excuse anything but does help us to gain a better insight into events and, above all, urgently to inform the UN of the need to step up its work and to resume its mediation. Furthermore, we must, above all, lay a great deal more stress than at present on the meaning of the academic conference held in Istanbul only recently on the Armenian issue. It is a taboo that has finally been broken, and it has taken a very firm commitment from the Prime Minister to make this happen. This does not mean that, from now on, Turkish public opinion is prepared to recognise what took place, but at least it is the start of a crucial stage towards such recognition. Mr President, Commissioner, the process will fail if the negotiations that you are conducting and the progress that they give rise to are not mentioned. Give descriptions, explain yourselves – you need to fight on two fronts: that of your Turkish partners and that of European public opinion. Fight on both of them and never fail to do so!

Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, there is every likelihood that this Parliament will shortly reject the proposed Directive on the patentability of computer-implemented inventions. All our major groups, and even – I beg their pardon – the smaller ones, have taken this decision, albeit for contradictory reasons. I have neither a mandate nor any official capacity here to comment on those reasons. However, this convergence has a common significance. On the merits of the question, we are split roughly 50/50, making the result totally unpredictable with a relative majority, and with a bilateral impossibility of achieving a qualified majority. Each of our parliamentary groups prefers to reject the text rather than to adopt the other’s opinions. Above all, however, there is a collective and unanimous anger on the part of the entire Parliament at the unacceptable way it has been treated by the Commission and the Council. (Applause)
 A total and cynical contempt for the choices made by Parliament at first reading. A total absence of any consultation by the Commission in drafting the text for the second reading. Repeated attempts even to stop discussions between Governments within the Council itself. As a matter of principle, this is scandalous enough. The crisis in Europe today has a lot to do with the deficit of democracy, an area where the Council has an overwhelming responsibility, as it has proved amply on this issue. Let us hope that this rejection is a lesson to it! (Applause)
 On the merits of the issue, the state of opinion, as reflected here, clearly shows that the problem is not yet ripe for a decision. Only with a more in-depth debate could it have matured into a wider consensus. On this vital and highly challenging subject – with several tens of billions of dollars at stake each year – a collective awareness is clearly beginning to emerge. In that context, rejection is a message directed at the European Patent Office. The European Parliament has refused to ratify the recent judicial errors by extending the scope of patentability to certain software programs. If these errors were to continue, it now seems clear that a parliamentary majority would emerge to put a stop to them.
 Michel Rocard (PSE

rapporteur.

 Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, we are in the final stages of a long and fine parliamentary battle. I have to remind you what is at stake, although five minutes is an absurdly short time for such a complex problem. There are three issues. The principle of the free movement of ideas, respect for competition and the rejection of the monopoly effect of patents, and finally the protection of individual inventors and small and medium-sized companies against the overwhelming might of a few very large corporations. Everyone here wishes to clarify the law and believes that a directive is needed. No one here wants all software to be patentable. So, there should be no problem, except for the fact that a recent development, scarcely more than 20 years old, has complicated matters. In the earliest days of the IT industry and when the first computer software was developed, no one ever thought of patenting it. Silicon Valley, Mr President, operated on this basis and developed for 20 or 30 years without patents. Software was protected by copyright, which was quite sufficient. Then, from the US, where there is no law on these matters, the idea emerged of extending patentability into this area. The starting point is the idea that the immaterial is not technical and that everything that connects to the material world and that uses matter, energy or tools is patentable. To be patentable, something must be new, inventive and capable of industrial application and must make a technical contribution. Everything that is a carrier or handler or that presents information to a software program which then processes it or that extracts the results of the software program's calculations in order to transfer them to the real world via a moving component or a signal – all of this is patentable, while the software program itself is not. Later on, software programs were embedded inseparably in an invention in which carriers, software and handlers were again linked and inseparable. Then, inventions appeared in which only the software was new, while the carriers and handlers were old. We have therefore seen a number of courts and certain national patent offices, as well as the European Patent Office, committing the error of considering everything as technical, with the result that there are now 200 000 patents of this type, or more, in the USA, and 30 000 granted by the European Patent Office, notwithstanding Article 52, paragraph 2 of its basic charter, which stipulates that software programs are not patentable. The abuses are well known and must not be forgotten: patents have been issued for teaching methods, commercial methods and guides for surgeons. In all these cases, if the software programs had been free, the whole of Africa could immediately have benefited from them, for instance in the fields of teaching or medicine. However, they are patented in the US, with the result that they are extremely expensive and out of the reach of the modern world. We have all condemned these abuses, including those of the European Patent Office, but its error has meant that the dividing lines are not clear. Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, you are being asked to go back to first principles and to the law. However, some of our most prestigious industrial companies have not understood what we are doing. They are afraid of losing their protection, which we can understand in the short term, because the removal of protection will disturb the equilibrium in some areas. What do the largest companies do today? They swap portfolios of patents among one another to avoid the drawbacks of patentability suffered by anyone unable to take part in this game – namely anyone not as large as they are. Legal costs in all these companies’ research and development budgets are increasing relentlessly, and now exceed 20% just about everywhere. Two thirds of patents in force in the European territories are American or Asian, not European. Finally, when Siemens, GEM PLUS or Alcatel sell their mobile telephony divisions, these divisions go off to Asia, taking their patents with them, thereby depriving Europe of any chance of developing in these areas. We therefore feel, Mr President, that, in the long term, the defence of our European industry is better served by liberty and by freedom of access than by patents. Moreover, China is training 2.5 million IT professionals every year. How can we face up to this challenge? The best way is freedom. Our leading industrialists should have grasped this, instead of which they have tried to use ridicule. What is more, this debate has given rise to a number of insults. For instance, it is a ‘man of the Middle Ages’ addressing you now. This is an indication of just how weak their position is. Our industrialist friends should admit that, just because an error has occurred, there is no reason to adapt our principles and law to fit in with it. Turning now to the final problem, the TRIPS Treaty, ADPIC in French, can be interpreted in two ways. Either all software programs are patentable, in which case there is no problem: they all fall within the TRIPS (ADPIC) Treaty and WTO panels, but that is not what we want. Or alternatively, no software program is patentable: they all fall under the international laws of copyright. They also depend on the WTO panels, but with other rules. In the second case, we are also complying with the TRIPS treaty, although we are aware that the only thing prohibited by that treaty is the grey area. If there is a difference of opinion as to why a particular piece of software is patentable, the dividing line has ceased to be effective and the situation where ‘everything is patentable’ is possible, or at least is permissible. Ladies and gentlemen, you are being invited here to reconcile principles, the law, consistency and clarity and merely to ask our major industrialists to make an effort to adapt – an adaptation which everything suggests will be much less painful than they believe. (Applause)

Mr President, as a French citizen I feel bound to begin this speech by rejecting the comments I have just heard from one of my fellow citizens. The demise of a draft Constitution is not the end of all the Treaties binding us together! Europe has done enough to earn the right to send a collective message. Laschet, my congratulations on your good report! If there is any abuse of power – that was indeed the word used – it is by taking the salary of a Member of the European Parliament and then biting the hand that feeds you, ignoring all the efforts we have been making for sixty years. (Applause)
 Mr President, Minister, Commissioner, I support this Laschet report. In these dark days for Europe, I am happy to see this rare moment of convergence between the Council, the Commission and our Parliament. I am pleased to commend the excellent report of a colleague who, rather more than is customary, took the views of his colleagues into account, and I am ashamed that there are only 25 of us at this sitting, a fact which hardly enhances the credibility of our debate. Mr President, I should like to give you a message for the Presidency. We can try to reform the United Nations, but it would be better to start by reforming ourselves. I am certain that the 700 or so colleagues who are absent are not merely enjoying a siesta. They are at work in their offices. Our work is badly organised. We need one or two major debates in plenary session each month in this building and, apart from that, everything should be discussed in committees. These debates should be dignified affairs. It is impossible, with only a couple of minutes available, to make an analysis or express a line of thought. I would therefore say, Mr President-in-Office of the Council – begging your pardon for representing a Parliament of which I am basically a little ashamed – that my main concern is that by defending this good report and all the good work we do together in Europe, you might be aiming at the wrong target. There are too many responsibilities, too may targets. It is true that Europe has its reasons for wanting a seat on the Security Council. It is true that the time is not ripe and this is virtually out of the question at present. I would advise you not to waste too much time on it and to focus on what is reasonably possible, on what would generally make a difference and on aspects where our work, and in particular the Laschet report, can be constructive. I would quote Article 2 and chapter VII on the transfer of the right to invoke the Charter to regional organisations. This is a great innovation. I would also cite the transformation of the Trusteeship Council into a Council for Failed States. Finally, I would mention the introduction, in Article 17, of a reference to global public goods. As I have overrun my allotted time, I will stop here. This is all absurd; we are all saying more or less the same thing. Do not aim for the wrong target. Concentrate on the innovative aspects – and only on them – and we shall have done a good job. (Applause)

Mr President, Commissioner, one minute is not enough for me to talk about the unease that is gripping the world of Internet users regarding the procedure for adopting the directive on the patentability of computer software. The Luxembourg Presidency did not have the right to refuse passage from point A to point B; adoption at point A – 
albeit following a debate, with one vote against and three abstentions –
 is almost unprecedented. This image is disastrous. We have Internet users who are saying that they will use this as a reason to vote against the Constitution. This is stupid and dangerous. There is, however, also and above all the question of the merits. We have listened to you and, once again, we agree with the vocabulary and the written text. We should not just patent anything! We should limit it. Having said that, in the draft directive there is still no clear distinction between what is patentable and what is not. I would therefore like to ask the Commission the following question: do you or do you not think that a clear distinction between what is patentable and what is not is essential to this text? If so, do you think that the only possible distinction (as we do not know of any other) is whether or not energy or materials are used, as the reference to the technical contribution is tautological and allows anything to be patented.

 Mr President, Commissioner, High Representative, I should like to thank you for your excellent introductory remarks and for all of the congratulations that you have addressed to me. I was proud to do this work and one of the things that I can say about it is that we were extremely well received by both sides. Europe was most welcome, even from Israel’s point of view, I must say. If I run over time, I shall miss my train; I shall therefore be brief and I should be grateful if you could forgive my rudeness because I do not have the time to listen to your responses. All I can do in the rather ridiculous amount of time that we have for debates is to point out the crucial points that should continue to be the focus of your attention. Firstly, the forthcoming elections in Palestine will be considerably less straightforward than the previous ones, in which there was effectively only one candidate, no real battle for power and no Hamas candidate. This time it will be different, both for the municipal and for the legislative elections. The elections will be fiercely contested. I hope that the Palestinians can be persuaded to abandon the use of the civil identity register and that the municipal elections are monitored as closely as the subsequent legislative elections; this is important. Some have said, I understand, that this is a window of opportunity and a ray of hope. The main element of that ray of hope is based on the undeniable quality and depth of the Palestinian people’s democratic will. My friend Mr McMillan-Scott said this straightaway. He is right – this is a choice to pursue peace, as well as a choice to pursue democracy. We are less sure about the other side. Mr Sharon’s decision to pull out of Gaza is to be applauded, but I should like to draw the House’s attention to the fact that, from our point of view and that of the roadmap, there is no link in Prime Minister Sharon’s rhetoric between Gaza and the rest, and he offers no guarantee that, after Gaza, he is considering the West Bank and Jerusalem. This is an absolutely key issue. My second point concerns the eradication of terrorism. There is much that we can do. Mr Sharon is right to set demands, Mahmoud Abbas is right to set about doing this and is doing so with courage. He is sociologically under an occupying foreign force, so it is impossible to eradicate terrorism completely. I feel that Mr Sharon, an experienced general, knows what he is talking about; he knows that by demanding an end to all terrorism before any talks can resume, he is asking the impossible so that he can be sure of not getting it. Perhaps he needs to be told that terrorism will be eradicated from Palestine when, as one people, the Palestinians will be able to hope for a different life. This will involve the economy, opening the borders, trade, work, creativity and a political perspective. These are the conditions, and I feel that it is our duty, as well as that of the international community, to remind him. I should also like to point out that, until now, nothing has contradicted the tragic analysis made by an eminent Israeli academic in a book that you know well, High Representative, because I lent it to you. According to this academic, Mr Sharon respects the Palestinians, does not want them to die of hunger, but is engaged in demolishing any collective identity and, in his heart, rejects the idea of a State. We should take this analysis further in our speeches and our work, in order to put pressure on him. My last message is that I do not believe that either in Israel or in Palestine will a political authority have the legitimacy to convince people of the need to sacrifice certain symbols for peace, be it Jerusalem or the right of return, while the religious authorities themselves fail to preach peace and the sharing of those symbols based on consensus. Without that, we shall achieve nothing. Please tell them that from us.

 Mr President, I should like to propose an oral amendment to Amendment No 71, as it mentions certain facts with which not everyone is familiar. On behalf of my group, I should like to suggest replacing the phrase ‘the re-opening to pilgrims of the Armenian National Mausoleum in northern Anatolia’ – in which the word ‘mausoleum’ is an inaccurate translation – with the phrase ‘the re-opening to pilgrims of the ruined Armenian churches of Ani, near Kars in Eastern Anatolia’. None of our Armenian friends were aware of this place or of its opening to pilgrims. The same can be said for the second oral amendment I would like to propose. There is doubt as to whether Turkish historians are in fact keen to carry out research into the genocide, and I therefore propose removing the reference to ‘Turkish historians’ in the plural, and merely including the name of the head of their school, or ‘Halil Berktay’, the Turkish historian who has done a great deal to further our knowledge of the Armenian genocide. Ladies and gentlemen, many of you have said that you were unfamiliar with this name, and that the amendment was out of place, but you should now be aware that it is a reference to Halil Berktay. The rest is to remain unchanged, as these were merely clarifications.

 Mr President, Mr President-in-Office, Commissioner, I should like to start by saluting Mr Eurlings and thanking him for the high quality of his report and the spirit of openness that he showed throughout the process of compiling it. The report has been substantially modified by the Committee on Foreign Affairs, but as it now stands here in the plenary, it recommends opening accession negotiations with Turkey without undue delay, and recalls that the objective of these negotiations can only be accession and nothing else. These two points are in line with what the majority of my group wants. That is why a large number of us in the Socialist Group will be voting in favour of it, unless one of these points is called into question by an amendment adopted in the sitting. In any case, it would send a very strong message to Turkey if this report were to be adopted by a substantial majority. I should like, Mr President and Mr Eurlings, speaking in a personal capacity, to express two regrets about the nature of the debates that we have just held. The first concerns the tone of our spoken and written comments. The twentieth century was a very violent one for Turkey. The evidence of this is plain to see: in Cyprus, in its relations with the Armenian and Kurdish peoples and also in the prominent role played by the army and the police in the internal socio-political organisation of the country, where they remain all-powerful. We are all aware of this. In the same way, many nations that are now members of the Union have also experienced totalitarian, fascist or communist governments or governments guilty of collaborating with an occupying power. Building the Union is a process of reconciliation with all of this. The prime reason for opening accession negotiations with any country is to set such a process in motion, and this will only succeed if there is a minimum of confidence in the effectiveness of this process both within the Union and in the candidate country itself. In fact, these insistent, sometimes aggressive and often repeated reminders of some of the blackest events in recent Turkish history are inspired more by suspicion and hostility than a desire to start a process of democratic consolidation and reconciliation between all peoples on the basis of an established historical reality. That is enough: we have gone too far. When France and Germany began their process of reconciliation by building the Community, they were very careful not to highlight quite so harshly all of the grounds that they might still have had for conflict with each other. In the same way, Spain, Portugal and Greece also joined us after black periods of fascism. I do not remember our requirements for tidying up penal codes and changing the attitudes of the police being quite as harshly worded as they are today. I only hope that Turkey does not see this as a cause for tension and think that any offence is intended, as this is not the case. But we are taking a risk. My second regret relates to the subjects that we have debated. Basically, we have only discussed our own internal or bilateral affairs and the clear, tricky and obvious difficulties, the undeniable difficulties presented by this accession. We have hardly mentioned the future and the largely positive possibilities opened up by the prospect of this accession. As a result, these aspects are not adequately reflected in the report. The enlargement of our market to encompass a market of 70 million consumers, in a country where the economy has been growing very rapidly for the last six years, will strengthen the Union considerably, and let us not forget that growth in Turkey will help to alleviate substantially the concerns that some of our nations have about migratory movements. But above all, by opening up to a country that is secular but where the majority religion is Islam, the Union would make a major contribution to peace and mutual understanding between peoples in these times of increasing tension, aggravated mistrust and conflict between Muslim and Christian countries. This contribution, over and above its symbolic significance, is of major strategic importance. That is the reason for our support. It would have merited greater emphasis.

Mr President, Mr Tajani, ladies and gentlemen, the two principles that have guided my work since the start of this process have been ensuring that all modes of transport are on a more equal footing with regard to passengers’ rights – which is an objective that the Commission and the European Parliament have set themselves – and ensuring that these rights are clearly enshrined in this text. In the latter instance, special attention was paid to people with restricted mobility, since the maritime transport sector was in fact lagging behind somewhat where these people were concerned. The general spirit of the text is that people should be able to travel in Europe without being subjected to the whims of the companies concerned, and should be able to demand a minimum level of service and a minimum level of information and, lastly, that persons with restricted mobility should be able to benefit from the same quality of rights as other European citizens without their being penalised twice over. The content of the version adopted in committee on 31 March would appear to be acceptable to everyone. This is, firstly, because the rights of persons with restricted mobility are being increased. Should this text be adopted, it will no longer be possible to refuse persons transport on the grounds of their disability, except, of course, for reasons linked to boarding conditions, to respect for their dignity and to the technical elements of the vessel. Furthermore, assistance must also be provided for persons with restricted mobility, and this, from the time of booking; today, thanks to the Internet, there is a need for return journeys and official information. This has therefore been dealt with in the text. Lastly, information on passengers’ rights must be standardised and provided in accessible formats, as happens today in the rail and the aviation sectors. When it came to the rights of all passengers, we felt it was important for compensation in case of problems also to be harmonised at a higher level, on the basis of what is being done in the aviation sector. As a result, passengers subject to delays and cancellations will be able to receive as much as a full refund, with a scale of refunds calculated according to the problems encountered. Information should be clear and accessible, which is often a problem in the transport sector. We see it all the time: people not having enough information, not knowing why the boat – in this case, but it could just as well be the train or plane – is not departing, or why there are delays, and we wanted to improve these methods of information provision. Lastly, complaints management must be better organised. Indeed, making a complaint when problems arise is a complicated business, and this text is designed to simplify the procedure, both at Member State level and for individual citizens. The role of the national bodies that will manage complaints has also been addressed, and it has been defined better. Finally, urban and suburban transport services – I refer in this regard to Mr Albertini’s beloved vaporettos in Italy, in Venice – shall be excluded from this text, since they do not fall within the scope of major transport services. Moving on now to cruises, and their place in this text: I would remind you that cruises are an extremely important type of holiday today, and that their target group includes both elderly people and disabled people. This is why cruises are, of course, integrated into this text, not only with reference to the Package Travel Directive on which the text depends and which is a 1991 directive, but also with an assurance that consumers will receive the same level of treatment. The definition of force majeure
 – which represents grounds for a possible refusal of transport – is put forward, and, on this issue, we have worked on a consensus amendment, which we have produced jointly. I would however remind you that in the aviation sector, today, the Court of Justice has often been obliged to take decisions due to cases of force majeure
 not being defined well enough. Thus in this text we have tried to address problems linked to maritime transport. I am referring to tides, winds and storms, which are also par for the course with maritime transport and which had to be considered. To conclude, the responsibility of ports to provide assistance has also been the subject of debate. This is a text on passengers’ rights; it is not a text … (The President asked the speaker to conclude)
 ... and so, with arbitration between the ports and the carriers having been carried out, this is the sum of the text. I know that Mr Jarzembowski is going to table his amendments, so I shall reply in the two minutes that I have left.
 Michel Teychenné,  
rapporteur. 
− (FR) 
Mr President, first of all I should like to refer to the amendments tabled by Mr Jarzembowski, who was telling us just now that we need to be reasonable – I believe that the important thing about this text is that it is in fact reasonable. Is it reasonable to want to do away with the obligation for carriers to train staff who are in contact with persons with reduced mobility? Is it reasonable to abolish compensation for lost equipment, especially wheelchairs for persons with reduced mobility? Is it reasonable – and Mr Rack, who was here just now, pointed this out, and I thank him for his speech – to avoid reimbursing passengers, a practice that happens everywhere, and especially in the United States, in particular when departures have been cancelled and when no information, or alternative transport, is provided? Therefore those elements in your amendments do not seem reasonable to me, and I was anxious to say so. For the rest, I believe that there is a consensus. It was evident from all of the debates. I should like to thank the Commission, the Council, and all of my fellow Members who have worked on these issues in an excellent frame of mind, because we understood that there was an extremely important issue at stake for the people of Europe. I therefore believe that, tomorrow – and here I appeal to the Group of the European People’s Party (Christian Democrats) and European Democrats: your amendments are not reasonable – we must vote in favour of this text, and we must send out a strong signal at a time when Europeans sometimes doubt Europe. As Mr Tajani was saying, we must send a strong message to these 500 million citizens telling them that their needs as Europeans are being taken into account. That is what I wished to say.

 Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, the package on which we will be voting tomorrow would have come to nothing without the will of the European Parliament, and I would like to take this opportunity to pay tribute to the work that has been done. If the European Union creates a legal instrument that, as I hope, will make it possible to prevent disasters such as the shipwrecks of the Erika
 or the Prestige
 and finally to make the polluters take responsibility, it will be thanks to the European Parliament’s perseverance in the face of the Council’s timidity. There is no point in reminding you of the resolve that has been required in order to bring the reports by Mr Savary and Mr Fernandes to the table. This is a political victory for the European Parliament, and it is also a victory for steadfastness and working together. Thanks to this ‘maritime safety’ package, the Member States will finally have to fulfil their obligations in the International Maritime Organisation and, in particular, carry out technical audits before issuing a flag to a ship. Another consistent step forward is the requirement for ships to be insured by financial guarantee certificates, which will put real responsibility on their charterers. If Parliament adopts these texts tomorrow, the European Union will be showing that it has provided itself with an effective tool to fight against waste ships and against criminal charterers and owners, and it is to be hoped that the environment and the health of our fellow citizens will benefit. Finally, I would like to pay tribute to the work that has been done in this field by Mr Tajani, who is here today, and the rapporteurs on transport law, because we have now embarked on the final stages of the process on maritime law with the aim of covering all transport in Europe. It is therefore in relation to that work, which has seen a real delay in maritime transport, that, I hope, Parliament will also be able to round off an important strand on maritime transport during this session or, at any rate, as soon as possible.

The social economy needs more than ever to have a specific legal framework and Mrs Toia’s report is a step in the right direction. The European Commission has withdrawn two proposals intended to put in place statutes for European mutual societies and associations. At a time when the cracks in the capitalist system are obvious, it is odd to withdraw proposals that promote alternative and effective types of economic organisation. Founded on principles of mutualisation and interdependence, the social economy advocates a new concept of business practice that is more human and breaks with the capitalist approach of the simple pursuit of profit. It has been expanding successfully in recent years and today represents 10% of businesses and 6% of jobs in the European Union. The Commission’s attitude may be deplorable, but nonetheless we can feel pleased about Parliament’s vote. The call for the characteristics of the social economy to be taken into account in the framing of European policies is to be welcomed, as is the demand for reactivation of the specific budget heading.

Thanks to this report, the European Parliament is reaffirming its commitment to fundamental rights, such as the right to dignity. It is unacceptable that, within the European Union itself, the reception conditions of migrants and asylum seekers are not exemplary. The detention centre visits by MEPs between 2005 and 2008 have enabled this report to be drafted, under the leadership of Mrs Roure. The report reveals the extent of the irregularities in the migrant detention system in Europe, pointing the finger at problems to do with legal advice, medical care, hygiene, promiscuity and information. It is therefore an alarm bell that the European Parliament is today sounding. Member States must take note of this and, where necessary, must apply the existing ‘reception’ and ‘procedure’ directives as soon as possible, or make progress in implementing them.

Although the Economic Partnership Agreements (EPAs) give a great deal of structure to the EU’s relations with the countries of Africa, the Caribbean and the Pacific (ACP), the European Parliament is sending out a very bad message by adopting this report. Europe absolutely must reverse the way in which it negotiates and trades with the ACP countries, if it does not wish to contribute to their ruin. This report validates a system based on an alleged equality between the parties, when the EU is, in reality, the world’s leading economic power, and the ACP countries have a huge amount of catching up to do. There is now an urgent need to adopt an asymmetric and consensual approach that will finally give these states a chance where global competition is concerned. My colleagues from the Socialist Party in the European Parliament and I have voted against the report. Its adoption by Parliament is indeed proof that Europe is governed by the right, and that this must change!

 With this text limiting the production and sale of pesticides, and the accompanying text setting out the framework for their use, Europe has finally achieved exemplary standards for pesticides. Hiltrud Breyer’s report is on the right lines. Whilst allowing low-risk products onto the market, it bans 22 substances deemed to be very harmful. If we are to hope eventually for rational agriculture around the world, we must welcome this advance by the European Union. European agriculture, which makes abundant use of plant protection products, will not be weakened. However, with these texts, the EU will have the most rigorous legislation in the fight against toxic pesticides.
 President. – 
 Before the vote, I have a request from Mr Watson to take the floor to table a procedural motion.
 President. –  
Mr Watson has, in my opinion, already broadly expressed a feeling that is shared by us all.
 President. – 
 Ladies and gentlemen, Mr Cohn-Bendit has the floor, and your behaviour in this matter does little for Parliament’s reputation.
 President. – 
 The chairman of the Committee on Legal Affairs, Mr Gargani, has the floor. (Protests)
 President. – 
 The speeches that have been made may well clarify both the form and content of this matter. Ladies and gentlemen, we have not received notification today of this decision of the Polish Government, which, I might add, is highly questionable. Parliament’s role is to safeguard and protect the parliamentary duties exercised by one of its Members. What I imagine will happen is that the Conference of Presidents will have to debate this issue and that the Committee on Legal Affairs, precisely in the terms stated by Mr Gargani, will be very keen to ensure that Parliament’s independence is respected, and I therefore consider this debate now closed. (Protests)
 The debate is closed. The next item is the vote. (Despite the President’s urgings, the protests continued)
 President. –  
The next item is Voting time. (For results and other details of the vote: see Minutes)
 President. – 
 Very well, since you do not wish to be quiet, I am going to give the floor to the group chairmen who have not yet spoken on this matter.
 President. – 
 Mr Crowley, we could give the floor to any one of the 765 Members of this House to speak on this subject. I have given the floor to the group chairmen, and you have spoken on behalf of your group.
 President. –  
This matter will be referred to the Conference of Presidents. It will be discussed tomorrow morning, and I believe that the great majority of the European Parliament has come out in favour of supporting Mr Geremek. Just the once will not hurt, since I am President, but I too would like to offer my full support. (Applause from the left)
 President. – 
 Very well, Mr Goebbels, we shall ensure that that happens.
 President. – 
 Ladies and gentlemen, it is my pleasure to inform you that, within the context of interparliamentary relations, the Knesset delegation, chaired by Mrs Amira Dotan, chairman of the delegation for relations with the European Parliament, will be visiting our Parliament over the next few days. I should like to extend a very warm welcome to Mrs Dotan and to the members of her delegation. I should like to stress the importance that we attach to this visit. (Applause)
 They are seated on the left, and I extend a cordial welcome to them.
 President. –  
According to the analysis that has been done, Amendment 66 is covered by Amendment 127, which deals with derogations for hospitals. Therefore, we believe that matters have been voted on.
 President. – 
 These amendments, Mr Mikolášik, have been covered by the first package.
 President. – 
 The voting list is established in accordance with the Rules of Procedure, but if the House has no objections, we will do as the rapporteur wishes.
 President. – 
 That concludes the vote.
 President. –  
The seconds that you have saved you have given to Mrs Gill.
 President. –  
I am sorry, but we must move on to the next agenda item. I would inform you, however, that priority will be given at the Strasbourg sitting, in April, to all those who have asked to take the floor today, it being understood that they will have to re-register, for form’s sake. The presidency for that sitting will be told about this, and those MEPs will be put at the top of the list of speakers.
 President. – 
 Mr Stoyanov, I must cut you off there. I should like to know on the basis of which rule of the Rules of Procedure you are requesting to take the floor and on which matter, because, at the moment, your speech is of a somewhat general nature.
 President. –  
I would remind you that Rule 145 stipulates, on the subject of a speaker who takes the floor to make a personal statement, that he ‘may not speak on substantive matters but shall confine his observations to rebutting any remarks that have been made about his person in the course of the debate or opinions that have been attributed to him, or to correcting observations that he himself has made’. Therefore, please refrain from speaking on general matters and come to the point that concerns you, since you have taken the floor to make a personal statement.
 President. –  
You do not have to agree or disagree; these are the Rules of Procedure.
 President. –  
This is not a dictatorship; on the contrary, this is a democracy. We have Rules of Procedure, and they must be complied with. No MEP can make general remarks in this House on any subject of their choosing. Mr Stoyanov, it was my understanding that you wanted to take the floor in order to make a personal statement. That is not the case, and I cannot allow you to continue.

 Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, on 26 September of this year, the European Commission presented its report on Romania’s progress towards accession. It is now for Parliament to give its opinion. This is an important moment, as we are coming to the end of a process that will see the conclusion of the latest wave of enlargement. It is not the beginning of the next wave but, in reality, the end of the fifth wave. It is a time of great historic significance since it signals the reunification of the European continent. I should like, in particular, to take this opportunity to thank the Commission and, firstly, Commissioner Rehn who, throughout this process, has done some very painstaking and very rigorous work and with whom we have enjoyed smooth and excellent cooperation during the last two years. Moreover, my report does not neglect to congratulate him. I would also thank most sincerely all those fellow Members who have significantly helped improve and supplement my previous reports. I would thank, in particular, my colleagues not only in the Committee on Foreign Affairs but also in other bodies of this Parliament for their often pertinent comments and suggestions. This report is in the spirit of the previous reports since it is couched in terms that are meant to be positive, encouraging and open while remaining, I hope, tough, yet balanced. It also follows closely the conclusions of the Commission in its report of September 2006. As I see it, matters are clear. Romania was not ready in 2004. Since then, it has made considerable efforts, putting in place an impressive series of modernising reforms. It was important to emphasise this, and I wish to follow Mr Van Orden’s lead by, in turn, warmly welcoming Romania, as he, for his part, welcomed Bulgaria. In essence, this is a short report that focuses on two points in particular: the accession date and the support and verification measures envisaged by the Commission. The report is structured around six main issues. First of all, the report pays tribute to the Romanian authorities for the considerable progress they have made since the beginning of the process. Everyone agrees that the efforts at reform engaged in by the Romanian Government and authorities have been extremely significant. It was therefore necessary to underline this in our resolution. In September of this year, the Commission went on to recommend that Romania join the European Union on 1 January 2007. My report supports this conclusion, for which I had, moreover, been hoping and praying for some time. The wording also emphasises that, in the areas identified as problematic by the Commission’s May report, substantial progress has been made. It also notes that three areas were identified by the Commission in September as ones in which additional progress needed to be made. These were reform of the justice system, the fight against corruption and – to a lesser extent, I think – the absorption of Union aid in the agricultural sector and from the Structural Funds and the application of the acquis communautaire
 in certain areas of food safety. Fifthly, my report supports the Commission’s proposal to introduce mechanisms to verify and support progress in these areas on the basis of a list of identified objectives. Such measures were applied during the previous enlargement, and this for the benefit of all the parties. It is not, therefore, a question of stigmatising or isolating Romania but, rather, of supporting it in its efforts to consolidate the reforms under way. Sixthly and lastly, my report urges the Romanian Government to take all the measures necessary and to make full use of the time remaining before accession so that recourse to the safeguard clauses might be avoided. That, ladies and gentlemen, is the general structure of the report. Only five amendments have been tabled for plenary, reflecting, I believe, the broad consensus that has emerged in relation to this document – a consensus we sought within the various committees. I now turn to some of the positions adopted by my group. My group will not be advising Members to vote in favour of Amendments 1 and 2 by Mrs Gibault and Mr Cavada. These amendments do, however, reflect a statement signed by more than 400 Members, including myself. On a personal basis, I shall, therefore, vote in favour of them, but my group’s position will be expressed through a free vote. My group will support Amendment 5 by the Confederal Group of the European United Left/Nordic Green Left on the efforts made by Romania towards accession and will vote against the same group’s Amendment 4, which is already covered by the report. Where Amendment 3 is concerned, my group will abstain. Here, then, are the fruits of work that I have been doing for only two years – a period shorter than that of Mr Van Orden’s involvement – and that had, moreover, been begun by others, notably by Mrs Nicholson, who preceded me as rapporteur. I am submitting the results of this work to you with some satisfaction because, in essence, I have always championed the same position over the last few years. We have a common destiny. Romania’s and Bulgaria’s place is in the European Union. We have to move forward. We needed, therefore, to be sympathetic, but firm. I believe that Parliament’s position, which closely resembles that of the Commission, was the right one to adopt because it has allowed the necessary reforms to be carried out and because, at the same time, it enables our common objective to be realised, namely the accession of Romania and Bulgaria on the date specified. I think that we must welcome this event as one more staging post on the way to the reunification of Europe. I hope that the consensus for which we have all worked will be reflected in an unambiguous vote by Parliament. I should like the message received by Romania tomorrow to be a positive one, delivered loudly and clearly and, if possible, by a substantial number of people, whereupon Romania should receive a warm and sincere welcome.

 Pierre Moscovici (PSE
). 
 – (FR)
 Mr President, Mr Barroso, Mr Rehn, firstly, I should like sincerely to thank Mr Rehn, whose work as Commissioner for Enlargement is appreciated by us all for its rigour, good sense and thoroughness. Thanks to him and to the work he has done, cooperation between the European Parliament and the Commission and between the European institutions and the Romanian and Bulgarian authorities has been effective and fruitful. The process of Romania’s and Bulgaria’s accession is now reaching a crucial stage: that at which our institutions have to take a decision confirming or, instead, postponing the date – initially set at 1 January 2007 – on which these two candidate countries are to join the European Union. I endorse the spirit of Mr Rehn’s report. As in the past, the tendency is to favour accession in 2007, but accession subject to precise conditions. I have been pointing out for many months that our friendship for Romania and Bulgaria and our support for the process of their accession always goes hand in hand with a precise demand, namely that there be respect for the criteria and for the reforms needed if the countries concerned are to move towards accession. However, I would go further than Mr Barroso and Mr Rehn regarding the judgment to be made today concerning the outcome of the efforts made by these countries to respond to our demands. Indeed, I firmly believe that, only seven months before the anticipated accession date of 1 January 2007, it is our duty finally and clearly to confirm this date or say that it no longer applies. Moreover, I am now, unlike Mr Cohn-Bendit, entirely convinced that this date should be confirmed. In expressing a more precise opinion on Romania in my capacity as European Parliament rapporteur, I have on several occasions had the opportunity to state that, in my opinion, the postponement clause should only be regarded as a last resort and emergency measure. I have on many occasions pointed out in this Chamber how dangerous it would be for us to trivialise this clause or to use it as a pretext for drawing attention to a variety of real concerns and one-off causes of dissatisfaction, so rather losing sight of the overall picture. I do not think that that is what is happening now. The Commission’s report emphasises that Romania now satisfies the political criteria and those to do with the market economy and that the acquis communautaire
 has continued diligently to be applied, although, admittedly, there remain a number of points in relation to which the country will have to make further progress. The Commission’s recommendations in this connection are valuable and must be put into practice. However, the report published today leaves me feeling certain that the country’s current situation is not so significantly wanting that a measure as radical as a postponement of the accession date would be the appropriate response. As for less serious concerns, the oral question that I submitted together with Mr van Orden and Mr Brok was designed to promote the other safeguard clauses of a quite different, and clearly less dramatic, nature. They offer the possibility of more continuous, sustained yet still very stringent monitoring, if need be accompanied by sanctions during the first three years following Romania’s accession to the European Union, and it would be the job of these clauses to respond to the various concerns that might remain regarding specific points. I also think it important to emphasise now what the cost would be of hesitating too long about giving a clear yes or no to Romania’s accession on 1 January 2007. May was set as the deadline by which the European institutions had to take a decision on the date for Romania’s and Bulgaria’s accession, and that seemed wise to me. I still think it is wise. Postponing accession would present practical problems. The time allocated to ratifying the accession treaty would be restricted and would perhaps even be too short. The debate on enlargement would become still more tense. That is why, while keenly appreciating the rigour of the work done by the Commissioner for Enlargement and while concurring with his analyses and demands, I propose that we proceed on the basis of this work and of the very encouraging results that he emphasises and finally formulate our clear agreement to, and support for, Romania’s accession on 1 January 2007 on the conditions specified by the Commissioner. (Applause)

Mr President, Commissioner, the process of Romania’s and Bulgaria’s joining the European Union has now reached a crucial stage, that of the decision that our institutions must take in order to confirm or postpone these two candidate countries’ date of accession, which is scheduled for 1 January 2007. Following the exchange of opinions that we had with Mr Rehn during April’s plenary, my fellow Members, Mr Brok and Mr Van Orden, and I thought that it would be helpful if Parliament were to keep itself informed, on the one hand, of the arguments put forward by the Commission in terms of setting the date on which these two countries will join and, on the other hand, of the nature of the monitoring process of which their reforms are, and will be, the subject. From this perspective, the role of the European Parliament, that of the rapporteurs, and my own role as rapporteur for Romania could be supervisory roles that I would describe as rational and fair, in the context of which we will fully exercise our right to inspect. That is why, three weeks prior to the presentation of the Commission report on the state of progress of reforms in Romania and Bulgaria, we have come to an agreement to submit this oral question, and to do so in the spirit that Mr Brok was outlining just now: far from wishing to give a premature verdict on the two countries’ membership, we simply want to put in practice  to implement  Parliament’s right to be informed by the Commission of the latest developments in the monitoring process. It is in this spirit of openness that we are submitting this question, which is focused on points that are the subject of genuine concerns and of in-depth debates, as borne out by the previous progress reports, particularly in the crucial areas of justice and of the fight against corruption. I believe that, in the context of the support that we are giving to Romania during these months of accelerated reforms, we are establishing two important notions  the rate and consistency of the progress made  while remaining aware, however, that there is no such thing as a perfect political system and that a significant amount of progress has already been made. The fact remains that we are not weakening in our resolve. Our concern remains one of knowing whether or not the Commission – and this is indeed the crucial question – has discovered, throughout recent months, exceptional reasons for alarm that should be brought to our attention. I do not wish to anticipate the report - that is not the aim of our debate - but I will say that, from a personal viewpoint, it seems to me that the Commission has not made such a discovery. There obviously remain points on which Romania ought to continue to make progress. That being said, the country’s current situation and the speech  relatively optimistic in this regard  made by Mr Rehn during the plenary session at the beginning of this month do not appear to reveal any major weaknesses that should be addressed with as radical a measure as postponing the date of accession. Allow me, moreover, to point out that a decision such as this could have a harmful effect on the Romanian authorities’ and people’s motivation to press on with the vast reform programmes that have already been embarked on, while accession – provided, of course, that we decide that it does not present any danger – would make it possible to stay within this virtuous circle. It is from this angle that the postponement clause must, in my opinion, be considered. Its aim is clear: it provides an antidote to a significantly dangerous situation. In my opinion, it would be dangerous to overuse the postponement clause or to use it in order to voice various concerns, which are certainly understandable but which call for a different response. With regard to less radical concerns, the aim of our oral question was to highlight the other safeguard clauses, which are of an altogether different nature and are much less dramatic. They offer the possibility of continuous and more flexible supervision during the first three years following Romania’s accession to the European Union. It would therefore fall to the Romanian authorities to address the various anxieties that could remain in relation to specific points while keeping in mind two crucial points: not only that of respect for Romanian sovereignty, of course, but also that of the demands attendant on accession to the European Union. (Applause)

Mr President, President Mitterrand used to say that there were two ways of doing politics: the clerks’ way and the cooks’ way. If I mention these two options, it is with the accession process of the countries of the former Yugoslavia and of Albania in mind. Listening to and reading the positions adopted by the Commission and by my fellow Members, I rather feel that it is the profession of clerk that they identify with, with their strict, scrupulous noting of the chapters accomplished, and their adding, where necessary, of additional stages such as bilateral problems between Slovenia and Croatia. I believe that we are making a fundamental mistake. In the case in point, it would be better to identify with the cook, so as to marry delicately and subtly the ingredients and the cultural diversities, to spice up the dishes, and to benefit from these new countries and all that they offer in terms of enriching our Europe. Europe remains an ideal of respect, tolerance and diversity; it remains a force for peace, especially for the Western Balkans; and it demands a shared vision, a vision of a common destiny. Nothing would be worse in this period of major economic crisis than for us to withdraw into ourselves and take refuge in a panic-stricken fear of others, of foreigners. Let us remember the approach of Europe’s founding fathers and let us apply it to these countries of the Western Balkans.
 Pierre Pribetich  (PSE
). 
 – (FR)
 Mr President, stability and prosperity in the Balkans, that is one objective – that is the objective – because behind all this is the question of peace in our area. Yes, the accession process is a tool, but it should not slowly turn into Penelope’s shroud, where we unravel at night that which we have woven during the day. The Balkans’ natural vocation is to join the European Union. That is a clear political will; that is a light which, especially for the people, constitutes a signal. I am not talking about enlargement, but what is needed, above all, is to encourage the integration of the countries and the regions in the Balkans. Yes, we need to show that we are demanding, that we demand democracy and justice, but to use these demands continuously to reject integration is, in my view, a basic political error. I cite as proof these issues, among others, of bilateral conflicts. We have to agree – and this appears in the report – a process for settling bilateral problems, but without for all that blocking the accession process. That is one way to build and to rebuild our European Union, enlarged to include all the Balkan countries.

Mr President, Commissioner, as symbolic as it may be in this institutional triangle, we are all the same witnessing with astonishment today an essential act of the European Parliament – the discharge – taking place, and one key participant is missing. Indeed, I am thinking, ladies and gentlemen, of the visitors who are witnessing this scene in which some speakers are saying that extra-budgetary accounts exist, which cannot be made public – meaning that they cannot be dealt with transparently – and in which the Council is not here to testify where necessary to difficulties or to other circumstances. I believe that as MEPs we cannot accept this state of affairs, this deplorable absence of the Council, and we can only protest and in particular approve the suggestion made by the chairman of the Committee on Budgetary Control, namely to postpone this discharge, because, otherwise, Parliament would make a fool of itself by validating accounts that it does not know about and has not had the opportunity to inspect. Frankly, Mr President, the Council needs to pull itself together and be able to provide the information needed in relation to transparency so that it can prevent the Eurosceptics from seizing upon this issue in order to say that we are not transparent and that we are committing errors, especially where democracy is concerned.

Mr President, we have whiffs of Islamophobia in the speeches of a populist extreme-right leader in the Netherlands; we have an increase in attacks against the Roma in the Czech Republic; and we have unspeakable, intolerable remarks by the Iranian President concerning the creation of a racist government in Palestine, alluding to the creation of the State of Israel in a UN conference on racism, intended primarily to promote tolerance and diversity. How could our Parliament, aside from showing indignation, not send a strong and symbolic message to promote that diversity, and the tolerance required in a globalised world, by forcefully condemning such remarks? How could it not call on the European Council and the Commission to send a solemn warning to states that subscribe to this aggressive logic, and even voice it, since history has taught us all too often that actions are unfortunately never far behind such remarks? How, during this sitting, Mr President, could our Parliament remain silent in the face of such racist, xenophobic attitudes, in a context of economic crisis in which the withdrawal of nations into themselves, protectionism, is sadly sprouting like seeds in spring?
 Pierre Pribetich  (PSE

Mr President, in 22 pages of European Council conclusions, only one tiny phrase addresses the problem of the future of the automotive industry, of a European industrial policy. Is this a practical response to the expectations of 12 million workers in the sector and to the concerns of 6% of the European Union’s working population? Is it a match for what is at stake? There is no proposal for a European plan, no prospects for the automotive industry, and no will to coordinate national policies. On 19 November 2008, I took the floor in this House on behalf of the French socialist delegation to question all of the European stakeholders responsible. I expressed my wish for a new car deal and for a solidarity-based, structured, swift and effective industrial policy in the short, medium and long term that would provide a coordinated response from the Member States and the Union. Four months later, following a joint resolution by several groups, we are again laying emphasis on the future of the automotive industry. What is stopping you from reacting, from acting, from rising to this challenge before it is too late? This is not rhetoric, Mr Topolánek, this is a call for action.
 Pierre Pribetich  (PSE

 – (FR)
 Madam President, ‘when words and actions go together, they create a beautiful harmony’. In saying this, Montaigne was undoubtedly thinking of the words and actions of politicians. Here, in cohesion policy, we must strive for this harmony. Inspired by our desire as Europeans to look on the European town as a key focus for the development of our societies, we have been given points to think about and promises to keep concerning general population decline, lack of jobs, urban pollution, reduced mobility within towns and housing that is unsuitable for sustainable development. These are all crucial challenges we must take up to make our European towns attractive, competitive and pleasant places to live. To mitigate the problems, our words must therefore be in harmony with our actions. That is the essence of the urban dimension of cohesion policy: coordinating performance and credit, harmonising them and making them effective for the new programming period. In conclusion, we have two commitments: the need to provide substantial and clearly identified financial resources to meet the Leipzig goals and, lastly, the need to see our towns cooperate with one another in order to face world competition using the wealth and diversity of solutions within our European area.
 Pierre Pribetich  (PSE

 Mr President, I should like to begin by congratulating my fellow Member, Mr Szymański, for his balanced report on the review of the European Neighbourhood and Partnership Instrument. Let us remember that the main objective of this report is to avoid the emergence of new dividing lines, or worse, splits, between the enlarged European Union and its immediate geographical neighbours, but also to enhance the stability and security of the area under consideration as a whole. Spreading peace is an oft-repeated desire but one that, very often, is hindered along the way by the reality of hatred and intolerance. Consequently, the proper functioning of this policy determines, in part, Europe’s international geopolitical standing. How can we effectively review this neighbourhood and partnership instrument? The main point can be summed up by just one word: ambition. More ambition, indeed, in dialogues with civil society and local authorities, to enhance their involvement in the conception and control of the implementation of this instrument. More ambition in aid support, with the aim of enhancing administrative, local and regional capabilities in neighbouring countries and, also, of promoting exchange programmes for civil society. More ambition in the areas of democracy, the rule of law and human rights. This budget support, however, must be subject to a selection process so as to make it accessible only to those who can make use of it, with a country-specific approach, under political conditionality, without forgetting to improve evaluation of policies. It is also imperative to clarify the relationship between European neighbourhood policy, a framework policy par excellence
, and regional initiatives, such as the Black Sea Synergy, the Union for the Mediterranean, and the future Eastern Partnership. Indeed, by reducing policies to increasingly limited geographical areas, we run the risk of losing the overall direction, visibility and transparency of the neighbourhood policy that the European Union wants to pursue. That is the price at which we will enhance the Union’s cohesion and synchronisation, our dedicated budget will be deployed, comprehensively, in the desired directions, and the European Union will, at last, fully assume its role as a centre of stability.

Mr President, overcoming the tensions of the past and making every possible effort to stabilise the Western Balkans can in fact depend only on the latter’s overcoming its own history. This supremely symbolic act of proposing this European day of remembrance, on 11 July, is part of this process and pursues several objectives. Firstly, it pursues the objective of paying tribute to all the victims of the atrocities committed in Srebrenica and to their families, and secondly, it pursues the objective of reminding all of the citizens and peoples of the need to be vigilant and of the fact that the powerlessness of States to act inevitably leads to such atrocities. It also pursues the objective of pointing out that the European Union should provide itself with a true common defence and security policy, so that it can intervene in the name of the principles and of the values that unite us and that guide us. Lastly, it pursues the objective of repeating to the countries of the Western Balkans that it is their natural destiny to join us soon, but that this implies their cooperating openly, at all times, with the International Criminal Tribunal, in order to bring war criminals to justice. This is our message, this is Parliament’s message to the current and future generations, so that time does not behave like rust, eating into memories, but, rather, so that it brings memories back to life.

 I voted in favour of all the amendments proposed by my colleague from the Socialist Group in the European Parliament, Mr Cercas, to defend social achievements in Europe, and the following three issues in particular, which I consider to be fundamental. Limiting the working week to 48 hours is an imperative that we have defended tooth and nail, since it prevents Member States from imposing upon their workers working conditions that do not respect their fundamental social rights. With regard to keeping on-call time as working time, the same applies to the health and safety of care workers, but also firefighters, other sectors subject to on-call time and all European citizens. Promoting the reconciliation of professional life and private life is the last achievement, but not the least. It enables our fellow citizens to achieve a balance that is essential for their well-being. I promised, along with my colleagues in the PSE Group, to defend the social rights of my fellow citizens. This is a resounding victory for European Socialists against the European Council’s proposals, which were deemed unacceptable. As my colleague Mr Cercas put it, we are giving them a chance to rectify a poor decision.

Mr President: ‘When Europe meets a good idea, they go around the world together’. By giving this quote by President Mitterrand, I wanted to point out that this climate change package is an opportunity, a real chance for the development of our territory. The CO2
 regulation for new cars that is part of this approach is the result of a compromise, as our colleague, Guido Sacconi, said, whom I congratulate. As with any compromise, we can look at it as a glass half full or a glass half empty. However, the target of 95 grams of CO2
 per kilometre by 2020 perfectly fits with the technological revolution, the ambition and the philosophy that we want to see emerge in industrial policies for the vehicle sector, which is being seriously affected by the crises, and it gives perspective on the compromise. However, this industrial situation requires several ingredients: the financial capacity of the Union to invest, to create a real European adjustment fund for a non-carbon economy, in particular in the vehicle research sector, and to bring together the employees of the sectors concerned through the creation of a consultative committee on climate change, in order to give direction to the social dialogue. The crises and the demands of the fight against climate change mean that we urgently need to generate new industrial policies based on this capacity to anticipate, to manage the social dialogue and to develop employment. ‘A wise man cures ambition with ambition itself’. The MEPs from the Socialist Group in the European Parliament therefore remembered … (The President cut off the speaker)

 Mr President, to recognise the key role played by small and medium-sized enterprises and to support them wholeheartedly against the problems that can hamper their growth, that is the declared and ultimate aim of the Small Business Act. As you know, small businesses play an undeniably crucial role in the European economic landscape. This invaluable support for building enterprise, the spirit of enterprise in Europe, is sanctioned by the principle introduced by the Commission: Think Small First. Who can be opposed to this? What does it mean? 99% of all businesses are now affected by this ambitious plan. The two most important things in any company do not appear in its balance sheet: its reputation and its people. Why have I chosen to quote Henry Ford? To say that while we are going to make life easier for SMEs, employees remain at the heart of enterprise, that the Small Business Act must also be a chance to promote the place of employees in the way these businesses are managed. Indeed, the Small Business Act should be a breath of fresh air within these companies bringing better recognition of their position, better consideration of their aspirations and that under no circumstances must we allow a ‘light’ Small Business Act with regard to labour law.

 Madam President, what should be our strategy to overcome this crisis? Right now, the facts are before us. The crisis is affecting all manufacturers and there is a knock-on effect hitting the 12 million European citizens who work in the automotive industry. We must think, first and foremost, of these workers and their families and we must make it our priority to protect them by answering this troubling question: what is the strategy needed to overcome this crisis? A fast and effective united and structured industrial policy for the medium and long term, a ‘new car deal’, a coordinated response by Member States and the Union that will be equal to the situation. I hear, in this Parliament, the old dogmatic views of outdated liberalism resurfacing: no help, no subsidies, competition, nothing but competition. Ladies and gentlemen, the time has come for regulation, for public action. We therefore need a new car deal, an ambitious and intelligent plan for the automotive industry, first of all to save jobs and develop employment in Europe, with support for training. Then, to speed up the technological change of these enterprises to clean and intelligent vehicles, with the resolve to revive demand, by simplifying the renewal of old cars on the road, which are generators of pollution, through the creation of a European environmental bonus. In short, Europe must act and must not fail to respond. It must act and not be silent and take no action. We must act and act intelligently to support this transformation.

Mr President, Mr Vice-President, Minister, ‘it is high time to rekindle the stars’. I wanted to begin my speech with this line from a Guillaume Apollinaire poem, to emphasise the importance for the European Parliament of relaunching its space policy. For more than thirty years, the European Union and its Member States have worked together in financing, drawing up and developing space policy. Alas, this policy has progressively lost its luminescence and radiance. It is true that in 2003, the foundations of a European space policy were set out by the EC-ESA framework agreement. It is also true that the ‘Space’ Council of 22 May 2007 was in line with the political continuum of this framework agreement. However, the light emitted by this star remains insufficient. For Europe’s independence, its role on the international stage, its security and prosperity all come together to make this major policy an incomparable trump card for an industrial policy that creates both jobs and stimulates growth; an ambitious policy for cultural, economic and scientific influence that is reinforced on the international stage and is an essential vehicle for society to acquire the knowledge that we wish to gain. In the institutional triangle of the Union, and to ensure that this does not turn into a Bermuda triangle, the European Parliament, on behalf of European citizens, must play an important and increased role in the drawing up and definition of this policy. It is high time to rekindle the stars. On 26 September 2008, the Council participated in this act and we want to make our mark on this policy. Of course, this address here and now on behalf of the Committee on Industry, Research and Energy is made in this same spirit. To follow the correct route, it seems to me essential to remember the fundamental elements in the creation of this space policy. Firstly, there is the question of the budget. We call for, from this point onwards, the creation of a specific budget line to reflect and demonstrate our commitment to European space policy. The space industries need sufficient public support to increase their research and development capacity and, quite simply, to remain profitable. International competition is hard and fierce. Whilst the United States, Russia, Japan and even India are significantly increasing their budget dedicated to the space industry, and multiplying public orders, us Europeans are still searching for the appropriate funding to achieve our ambitious aims like others search for lost time. Consequently, what initiatives can the Commission take to improve the contribution to the European space sector, and be not just an actor, but the major actor responding to this growing, global demand, across all aspects of space policy from beginning to end? The second point is the issue of strategic options for those applications linked, on the one hand, to Galileo and EGNOS and, on the other, to GMES, through the prism of governance to create an efficient structure generating a clear governance for a reinforced efficiency across all European space programmes. The final issue is the exploration of space. What is the long-term vision for our European space policy, and for what ends does it exist? Embarking on the long-distance conquest of space is a project for several decades and requires both long-term vision and ambition At this point, I see an echo of the speech made by President Kennedy, focusing the American people on a new uncrossed frontier. Made sacred on 21 July 1969, this step was, without a doubt, in the technological history of our civilisation, the most fabulous catalyst for progress for all space-related and even everyday industries. Give us, in this concert of nations, this long term vision. Here we find ourselves at a milestone on this long journey. Europe is at a crossroads with regard to space policy. Space has, from now on, multiplied its spheres of action and application. From scientific to defence activities, space covers sectors of activity as vast and as varied as environmental protection or the development of SMEs. Let us get closer to users and increase the viability and quality of the collected data. Let us become the leaders in the space market. It is a duty that we owe to future generations to fortify this European space policy and make the vital choices to place into orbit an avant-garde and futuristic Europe for subsequent generations to live in. Space is our new European frontier. The great history book lies open with its dizzying array of blank pages. Europe must not only play a part in it, but be the major actor. Therefore, it is high time to rekindle the stars.

Mr President, they all lived in one of the most cosmopolitan cities in Europe, Sarajevo. Sarajevo was, at that time, the symbol of an open Bosnia, populated by Muslims, Serbs and Croats. Meanwhile, nationalism struck blindly, massacring men and women, and indiscriminately destroying cultural symbols such as the library – the so very rich library – of Sarajevo, a victim of the folly of mankind. That was a very long time ago – 16 years. If I take the liberty of recalling these tragic events, it is in order to assess the progress made, it is to put into perspective this long road towards the Stabilisation and Association Agreement. Everyone should therefore be delighted with this situation. True, 2 500 Eurofor soldiers remain in that country. True, in a country still guided by the fear of political domination by another community, the result of the municipal elections of 5 October is yet another reflection of the domination of the nationalist parties. However, this afternoon’s gesture reflects, on the part of the European Parliament, a sense of confidence and a future in the easing of tensions, a rediscovered cultural diversity, and a willingness to accept the peoples representing such cultural diversity. It is this message of hope that we must remember today, since let us never forget the words spoken by President Mitterrand in this House: ‘nationalism is war’.

Mr President, at a time when our debates revolve inexorably, like whirling dervishes, around the crisis, I cannot resist the temptation of describing the approach of my colleague, Dan Jørgensen, as a circle, but this time a virtuous circle; one, what is more, that is virtuous in its transparency. With public procurement, to encourage the replacement of old vehicle fleets with new vehicles, is to put the economy at the service of the environment; to reduce CO2 
emissions in order to create demand is to put the environment at the service of the economy. This is a perfect equilibrium constructing this virtuous circle on the budgetary level, on the ecological level and on the level of transparency. It is at this price that it will represent a real step forward. In order to do this, we must be guided by two principles: a true assessment of the cost of a vehicle over its entire lifespan and transparent local decision making so that a socially responsible audit of the consequences for the benefit to the environment can take place. Without transparency, we shall have a circle, but far from a virtuous one. I should like to pay tribute to the work carried out by our fellow Member to reinforce this transparency. By making use eventually of all the facts relating to his or her purchases and of a record of achievements emphasising the real goodwill of local authorities in acquiring clean vehicles, every citizen will make the same assessment, will publicly and actually evaluate the reality of these commitments, beyond the rhetoric. In this vein, we can do no better than promote the creation of an ecological label, a visible, legible and understandable label of this ecological quality. In this time of crisis, the European car industry will find that this new demand for clean, ecologically labelled vehicles, far from acting as a brake, will act as a stimulus for development, a challenge to respond to. The economic crisis must in no way serve as a pretext for going back on improving our practice aimed at reducing the harmful effects on the environment. On the contrary, we have an opportunity here. Let us know how to grasp it and create new virtuous circles by thinking of our planet, here and now, but above all of future generations.

 Symbols are to sentiment what allegories are to thought. As colourful as it is, this quotation by the philosopher Alain is nevertheless a clear illustration of what these symbols represent for the European Union today. Listening to the Beethoven symphony or celebrating Europe together on 9 May are precisely the elements we are going to use from now on to ensure that Europe stays alive. They are a concrete expression of the values on which the Union is built, markers that gradually become implanted in the memories of the 500 million Europeans. By inserting this Rule in Parliament’s Rules of Procedure, the work by our colleague Carlos Carnero González, whom I congratulate, is sending out a political message from Parliament to the citizens based on these values, as proven by the opposition of the Eurosceptics. No politics without symbols! Giving Europe an identity through an anthem, a flag and a motto gives the citizens living and working in Europe an opportunity to see themselves as part of a single entity united in diversity. Displaying these symbols at all levels and in all institutional areas will ensure that there is a constant reminder of the values that inspire Europe. I would nevertheless like to stress today that Europe is experiencing a serious crisis of confidence and that we need to go even beyond these symbolic elements and envisage and rebuild together a strong sense of belonging.

 Madam President, the fragility of demand for new vehicles is evidenced by the downturn in Europe’s automotive industry. A leading French manufacturer has just announced 4000 job losses, plus 2000 job losses in Europe. At the same time, despite a 37% increase in profits in the first half, it is still determined to go ahead with the job cuts. On the pretext of rationalisation, there is too much focus on profitability at the expense of and without thought for ambitious industrial policies and, more importantly, without thought for workers. I would like to act as spokesman for these workers, who are the most affected by these measures, who are victims of this situation, and encourage this manufacturer to rethink its strategy and save jobs at the same time. At a time when we face an employment crisis, this should be the main priority. In this spirit, the decision regarding the proposal for a regulation to reduce CO2 emissions from new vehicles must balance different aspects: sustainable development and safeguarding employment through innovative industrial policies at all levels, particularly at the social level.

 Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, as draftsman of the opinion of the Committee on Regional Development, I would sincerely like to congratulate Mr Ortuondo on his main recommendations for the necessary development of European ports. I would also like to congratulate him for taking on board all of our proposals and I thank him on behalf of all my colleagues. Within the EU, the free movement of goods and people is essential for our growth and also demonstrates our solidarity. The goods transport chain – 90% of international trade and transport – requires that each link, each node, is optimised in view of this rate of flow. The 21st century port is not escaping the impact of this new mobility. As a part of the city, it has to be integrated into the sustainable planning of cities, in accordance with the main stated, proactive, objectives of the fight against climate change. As a part of regional development too, it must be optimised in view of the integrated approach in the Leipzig Charter. The European Ports Policy, which we are pinning our hopes on, must therefore respond to this important need as well as to the objectives set in this report, and must thus be integrated into our general approach.

 Madam Speaker, I should like to commend Mrs Trautmann, Mrs del Castillo, Mrs Toia and Mr Harbour for a job well done. How do we reap the full benefits of the digital dividend? That is the question. It is certainly the case that digital broadcasting is releasing and will be releasing frequencies. I deliberately use both the present and future tenses of the verb ‘to release’ in order to emphasise the fact that this change is not going to come in a flash, with a snap of the fingers; this is something that many players seem to have forgotten when arguing their case. In addition, the amount of investment is likely to frighten off many investors before they can even think about recouping this EUR 250 billion providential windfall. The distribution of these constraints must therefore be factored into our policies. I should like to use this rather short speaking time to emphasise the compelling need to establish a European frequency policy in which Parliament will be involved as a major player: as such, it will need to be aware of the limitations imposed by the physics of electromagnetic waves, be mindful of the need for frequency spectrum management and show due regard for the role to be played by standardisation bodies in making optimal use of this scarce resource, whilst always bearing in mind the general interest of our fellow Europeans. I should also like to remind the Commissioner that the roll-out of fibre-optic networks, to paraphrase Jean Cocteau, certainly needs grand declarations of love but it also needs tangible acts of love, accompanied by European funding included in the budget in order to carry them out, to build these broadband networks and to prevent the digital divide in Europe.

 Mr President, our discerning and determined position is eagerly awaited. The United States, due to the wishes of the Russians but also due to the current election period, cannot act as the catalyst of a global political situation in this area neighbouring the Union. We, the European Union, have a unique historical opportunity to build our foreign and security policy and develop Europe through its achievements and experience. We must not waste this opportunity. The necessary condemnations do not offer solutions. Even if Pandora’s box was opened with Kosovo, with a recognition defying the rules of international law, let us return international law and respect for human rights to the heart of the solution. Let us be firm and act politically. Let us adopt a clear, common and firm position towards Russia, but one which is aimed at finding a solution and a partnership, because we should be clear-headed in our approach to Russia in 2008. Let us propose, under the aegis of the European Union, a regional conference on the resolution of the situation and on the future of the partnerships. It is with this determination for a single voice of the European Union that we will minimise the destructive venom of nationalism which always, inexorably, leads to war.

 Mr President, you asked for the opinion of our colleague Mr Leinen first, in order to find out our feelings on this. As my colleague has already said, it is true that this manoeuvre appears to be a little dilatory; in other words forty of our colleagues who, for reasons that are their concern, have not been able to attend this sitting, are trying to use measures and procedures in order to prevent an urgent debate taking place here this afternoon. I really think that perhaps, rather than scrupulously applying the rules, we should look at the spirit of the Rules of Procedure. The spirit of the Rules of Procedure is really to ensure that the people who are tabling this quorum request are at least present so that they themselves can establish that there is no quorum. Otherwise, I find that the request is either a political manoeuvre or it is tactical, but it is dilatory. I would not wish, by strictly applying the law, for us to end up in the position where the urgent debates regularly organised on a Thursday afternoon, which are important, ended up being ‘avoided’, which would not enhance Parliament’s work.

Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, I would like to begin by thanking all of my colleagues, especially Jerzy Buzek for his report. As Aristotle said, ‘well begun is half done’. Actually beginning rather than encouraging a set of salutary objectives will thus be a fundamental step in laying the foundations of the vital commitment to combat climate change. This pressing challenge requires a new definition of the European Strategic Energy Technology Plan based on two redefined pillars: ensuring better, cleaner production with regard to CO2
 emissions through innovative technologies; and using less by decreasing energy use in all its forms and by promoting all the solutions. This basic good sense is unfortunately not sufficiently recognised in our major policies and measures to reduce energy use are not given adequate support in the SET-Plan or in the EU’s major structural policies. Another crucial element is the urgent need to increase both the human and financial resources needed to actually achieve our European goals. When will we at last provide a concrete response to the crucial demand, the formidable challenge represented by climate change? We are lagging behind when it comes to financing research on low-carbon technologies. To use Aristotle’s words again, Mr President, if we begin to provide extensive funding for research into these technologies, we will already have won half the battle in this new world. We will have complete energy efficiency and, in no time, exceptional energy efficiency.

Madam President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, I would first of all like to pay tribute to the report by my colleague Reinhard Rack. This new culture of urban mobility is a true revolution in terms of our way of thinking and travelling. To paraphrase the famous saying by Sieyès on the Third Estate: ‘What is urban mobility in a city? Everything. What has it been hitherto? Nothing. What does it desire? To be something.’ In using these words, I am expressing my complete agreement with this revolution in our behaviour and the urgent need for an integrated and general European approach to this new urban mobility, with emphasis on the consistency of the major principles of successful urban planning. I also want to express my complete support for the eventual provision of a standard basis of solutions that allows a tailor-made set of measures to be drawn up for each territorial level. Commissioner, that implies that the Commission must assume its financial responsibilities and put its approach into practice. During one speech, our colleague mentioned this method, using the image of a ‘sushi bar’ where Europe would propose different dishes and the urban areas could then take them or leave them. This flexible approach must not skip a course: our cities. We need all the ingredients to be able to revolutionise urban mobility and establish this new culture.

Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, first I want to congratulate our colleague, Zita Gurmai, on her achievement with this report on the Intelligent Car Initiative. We are well aware that in terms of the development of society, mobility is a source of wealth, growth and, consequently, the capacity to promote solidarity between territories and between people. If we want sustainable development we must combine the various transport modes to improve the traffic flow in towns and in the country. Although we certainly do not want to build our society around the car as in the past, the motor vehicle nonetheless remains a vital means of achieving the intelligent and sustainable mobility to which we aspire. If we want to make that a reality, we must design intelligent and sustainable vehicles, based on three requirements: they must be safer, cleaner and more intelligent. Over and above that statement of principle, Europe must give practical support to this initiative with directives and policies that will, in the long run, integrate all the electronic systems, nomadic or not, and make it possible to control the processes and to drive cars that are safer and cleaner, with lower CO2
 and particulate emissions. To that end, we must encourage car makers to consider even at this stage introducing all these electronic systems into the design of new cars, with a view not just to greater efficiency and ease of driving but also, as a result of all this, to reducing costs and simplifying manufacturing and installation. If we want to achieve sustainable mobility, we must also broaden the scope of these policies. Research projects and innovations should eventually generate intelligent roads, which will improve safety, reduce energy costs, use dialogue between vehicles and improve traffic flows. The European Union wants to promote a knowledge-based society and sustainable development. These initiatives must take pride of place in that context. Let me conclude by emphasising the vital need to be really ambitious, to set ambitious targets and create the conditions for growth and progress in Europe. Echoing the report by our colleague Zita Gurmai, the European Parliament is convinced that the Commission will respond to that expectation and to these needs by setting a new frontier for the European intelligent car and finally allocating the necessary funding to achieve that ambition.

 Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, negotiations to reach an agreement at first reading have knocked back many of the advances achieved through the work of Parliament. As it stands, this compromise text is unacceptable. It is unacceptable to treat minors as adults, to leave them without access to education, to allow them to be sent back to a country far from their own relatives. It is unacceptable to have common rules and procedures aligned with the lowest standards in Europe and to pull this directive down; it is unacceptable to leave so many doors open to serious risks of breaches of human rights, to undignified detention periods, and to leave so many people without legal cover for such situations.

Mr President, no one is denying that we need to establish a procedure based on the principles of hazard analysis and critical control points. Everyone welcomes the fact that at Community level the European Union is proposing inventive legislation on foodstuffs to guarantee the highest possible level of food safety for our fellow citizens. However, we must reduce the amount of pointless bureaucracy, especially for small and micro-enterprises, and ensure efficiency without restricting the objectives relating to foodstuffs. Do we need to sink into a health and regulatory phobia and drift? Certainly not. As the representative of Bourgogne-Franche Comté in Parliament, I am familiar with the methods used for the production of all the cheeses in my region by small and micro-enterprises. Bacteria are necessary to make cheese. Reintroduced to pasteurised milk – for certain cheeses – they ensure that these products meet the highest food safety standards. Increasing the volume of regulatory procedures would weaken small and micro-enterprises. That is why I am calling on Parliament to accept Amendment 12, which facilitates this flexibility.

 Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, since Turkey forms part of European history, since Turkey is a component of European culture, since Turkey constitutes a considerable economic and demographic opportunity for the EU, this position in favour of accession means that I can demand even more: more with respect to democratic principles, more with respect to secularity and more with respect to human rights. The European Union was built on values and principles that we cannot disown with a deafening silence during an accession procedure for the sake of diplomacy. Turkey must acknowledge the Armenian genocide, a historic and symbolic act, and this will bear witness to its political maturity. Parliament has insisted with all due conviction and force on this acknowledgement since June 1987. Twenty-one years on, must we come up with such a bland formulation?

 Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, as draftsman of the opinion of the Committee on Industry, Research and Energy, I want to congratulate the rapporteur Mr Ford, firstly for his … (text inaudible) on two aspects that I think should be emphasised. The first is counterfeiting, particularly the counterfeiting of pharmaceuticals, which is a real danger, a real danger primarily for the progress and peaceful climate of economic and trade relations with the countries of Southeast Asia, but also especially for consumers, whether in terms simply of safety or in terms of product quality. It is therefore necessary to underline, to highlight, the need to prevent all forms of counterfeiting, using the restrictive tools contained in the agreements. I would just like to emphasise again how necessary it is to fight the counterfeiting of pharmaceuticals for these two reasons: to protect the safety of consumers and safeguard the pharmaceutical sector from any unfair competition that does not respect the environment or health and safety rules. Only effective cooperation among all those concerned will guarantee the protection of consumers world-wide, and specifically those in Europe. The second aspect concerns the development of legislation encouraging a reduction in CO2
 emissions by companies, particularly mutual agreements on emissions trading. We need to bear in mind that the European Union needs to avoid penalising companies by imposing on them the proper and logical provisions of new environmental standards as part of the climate plan, without demanding the adoption of similar rules by other countries in return. Making these two points an integral part of our relations – in form and in spirit – would mean we could maintain the competitiveness of European companies while protecting consumers, and not forgetting climate protection of course. In short, it is undoubtedly a matter of finding a perfect balance in our relations.

 Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I would like to mention an aspect of importance concerning the discharge, namely the evaluation of actions through sampling. When I was preparing my working document on the Commission’s management of the CARDS programme on assistance for the Balkans, as part of the discharge, only 2.32% of operations could be audited by the Court of Auditors in order to evaluate the management methods used by the European Union for external actions in this region of Europe. One of the effects of the small sample size was that the Court of Auditors was unable to analyse the impact of external action on Montenegro because, out of the 256 actions financed, not one was examined. Under these circumstances, how can impact really be measured? What scientific and financial reliability should be accorded to these evaluation reports? Although, from a statistical point of view, small samples can be used to estimate the behaviour of the systems, the samples still need to be representative, which was not the case with the appropriations used to finance actions in Montenegro under the CARDS programme. Collectively, European taxpayers would gain from an improvement in the Court of Auditor’s methods for analysing samples in order to identify more clearly the effectiveness of appropriations from our budget.

 Galileo, the first Community infrastructure, requires all stakeholders to share the same goal: success. This challenge confirms the need for this support, not that we needed confirmation. Compared with its rival GPS, a series of setbacks have unfortunately impeded progress until now. With this amended report, we will arm ourselves with the tools for success based on a joint decision. Our new goal when building this global navigation system must be to look beyond the complexity of the regulations, the new architecture, clarified responsibilities and new governance. Doing this could avoid adding to the existing five-year delay. We have a collective responsibility to monitor its actual application and to engage in and instigate market capture by aiding its development. The electronics and software industries have everything to gain from the success of a radio navigation system. Ensuring that it takes precedence over the existing system will be a tough battle.

 Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, I would like to congratulate my colleague Mr Swoboda for the work he has done and the quality of his just and balanced report highlighting the progress made particularly with the Constitutional Law on National Minorities, and the work still to be done such as the necessary strengthening of the judicial system. We are delighted that the Croatian Republic has abandoned the Ecological and Fishing Protection Zone in the Adriatic, which was a source of tensions within the European Union. This is a highly symbolic act, if there can be such a thing, demonstrating how keen Croatia is to join the European Union. ‘There is no love, there is only proof of love,’ Jean Cocteau told us. With this act, Croatia has applied this maxim to our own situation. We in turn must stay on target for the signature of the accession treaty in June 2009, a symbolic date and an ambitious goal. There is no politics without symbolism. Let us affirm this, let us send out this strong message, and show the Croatian people, show Croatia how much we are looking forward to welcoming them into the European family because it is not just for Croatia, it is a strong symbol for the stability of the Balkans and for peace. Let us therefore work twice as hard to achieve this objective. Let us help the Commission and Croatia along this path.

The purpose of the Commission proposal was to introduce measures for reducing CO2
 emissions in accordance with the stated aims of the energy and climate change package. However, neither the Commission proposal nor the report adopted today addresses the urgent need to develop a fuel capable of making a real difference in the fight against CO2
 emissions. The disparity of the planned adjustments and the way they are to be spread, both over time and geographically across the Union, will make the proposed measures ineffective. If we really intend to move into a ‘clean-air era’, we ought to be more environmentally imaginative and support measures that will allow us to tackle climate disruption effectively. The taxation-change approach proposed by the Commission and by Olle Schmidt’s report fails to promote either research or the concept of a new alternative fuel to curb CO2
 emissions. I want to take a clear stand today in opposition to the thinking behind this report and that is why I voted against what is simply a compromise that subverts the declared aim.

The stress is therefore placed on innovation, a fundamental value within Europe. The first Knowledge and Innovation Communities will focus on key areas such as climate change and renewable energy sources, not forgetting nanotechnologies, which need proper support. The European Union will have a definite focus on innovation. A Europe of innovation, the innovation of Europe – the EIT is the missing link between these two concepts: a missing link that, if it is adopted in tomorrow’s vote, will enable the European Union to progress. It is by believing in roses that you make them bloom, as Anatole France reminded us. The EIT is like a rose in the garden of Europe. For the EIT to bloom, all the climatic conditions have to be right. At first reading, I expressed my regret at the meagre financial resources allocated to the EIT, at the inadequacy of this support: EUR 308 million is not a sufficient response to fulfil our ambitions. Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, we therefore need to change the financial climate and provide the resources necessary for our very real ambitions to take shape.

Madam President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, in this own-initiative report Mr Albertini has emphasised the need to establish a cross-cutting policy taking all aspects into account: transport, energy and the environment. Human movements are a source of wealth for society in various respects, economic, social and cultural, but they use energy and very often have a disastrous effect on the environment. Every society, in particular not excluding the European Union, has to seek a balance, which is a difficult task. It is in this context that the European Union shows its true value by playing a decisive role in the harmonious development of transport: a single European railway market, a Single European Sky, Trans-European Transport Networks, a European port policy. By setting ambitious targets with the energy-climate package, talking about shared aims now has to be followed up by action. To quote Plato: 'It is for us to follow the upward path and avoid the downward path'. Coordination and cooperation are the keywords of this cross-cutting policy. The coordination of infrastructures at European level to obtain an overall view of transport networks, cooperation with the local actors best able to take a practical and realistic view of the issues, because that is what Europe is. The will to harmonise by pooling all efforts, by exchanging best practice in the interests of citizens and the environment, with – not to be forgotten in this somewhat eclectic list – substantial extra financial support in order to implement the priority trans-European transport projects as quickly as possible. Above all, though, if we focus on the local aspects, it seems to me that the integrated approach can only be efficient with an intermodal approach financially supported by Europe, especially in congested metropolitan and urban areas, to ensure safe, secure and affordable mobility, in short, ecological and sustainable mobility.

 Madam President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, it is hands that build the town, and men that build the city. Jean-Jacques Rousseau must certainly have favoured the integrated approach. It is a method that falls directly within the scope of this approach of building cities and not fragmented towns, as set out in the Leipzig Charter and the Territorial Agenda. I therefore wish to thank all those responsible, especially Mrs Kallenbach, for their excellent cooperation on this task. I welcome the scope of the proposals in relation to social and economic aspects, the environment, spatial development and territorial cohesion, and likewise the close attention paid to proposals intended to improve the report submitted by our Socialist Group. Paying closer attention to the territorial and urban dimensions of EU policies, especially through integrated development plans and better cooperation between urban and periurban areas, will draw all the benefits out of this integrated approach. Cooperation, however, must not end there. Provision must also be made for a relationship or some kind of connection between rural areas, urban and periurban areas. Here I must stress the importance of stimulating the attractiveness and competitiveness of rural areas as a tool to combat the mass exodus from the countryside. If the main points in this report had to be specified, my first mention would be the urgent need to create integrated multimodal transport networks supported by Europe to improve infrastructures, especially environment-friendly transport such as bicycles and walking. Identifying the signs of decline in certain areas and stepping up work to implement a social integration policy constitute a framework for a public policy to reduce inequality in an efficient manner and prevent social exclusion. Positioning human beings at the very centre of the construction of infrastructure policies by reconciling urban concerns with human concerns, and all the more so within the current context of a housing crisis, in a society where not everyone has a roof over their head, and placing more emphasis on decent affordable housing, are still essential, and constitute a crucial factor of social integration and standards of living in cities, within a context of sustainable urban development. It is for this reason that I call on all my colleagues to vote en masse
 in favour of this report, which demonstrates the EP’s wish to support the sturdiest form of territorial cohesion and a comprehensive integrated approach that will finally allow us to build the city.

 I was keen to oppose the liberalisation of the postal services market based on three fundamental positions: - the need to have free postal services for the blind and partially-sighted, an essential value of a non-discriminatory society. - a guarantee from Member States of finance for the universal service before the opening of the markets, an essential condition for the protection of consumers. - compliance with employment legislation, particularly social security, by all operators. Because the relevant amendments were not adopted, I can only lament this drift towards uncontrolled liberalisation that fails to respect the fundamental right of European citizens to a public postal service.

Mr President, last week the package of legislation on climate change and energy was presented. We must welcome the spirit of the Commission proposals. These issues affect a large number of areas, in particular housing and more especially social housing. We realise that a large proportion of the housing stock in the Union will be affected by these necessary changes. The charges relating to heating, for instance, are a major expense for tenants and they need to be regulated and even reduced. The changes to social housing form part of our sustainable development policies and they call for appropriate financing in order to meet these new requirements. Until now, the Commission has concentrated financing on the new Member States, who have therefore received substantial support. The older Member States have not. National housing policies need consistent financial support to speed up changes to social housing. If the policies described are to be credible, we need to match actions to words. The Commission will have to take the necessary follow-up action and finance changes to social housing everywhere in the Union.

 The report by Mr Lechner on opening up the European consumer loans market was adopted today. It seems to me that changing a market that until now has been strongly national into a European market, while maintaining a high level of consumer protection, is the first step towards harmonising the rules on consumer credit. The risk for consumers of getting into debt remains far too high. Control and transparency by setting up databases of the creditworthiness of every consumer seems essential. Like most of my colleagues, however, I voted against Amendment 29 on Article 16, and I am pleased it was rejected. To my mind, this point genuinely penalised consumers who decide to repay their loan early. Offering consumers the possibility of paying off a loan before its term constitutes a good initiative. It should not be spoiled by giving the lender the option of claiming compensation for any costs where this is not fair or justified. It was therefore necessary to set limits. The lender will not therefore be able to claim compensation of more than 1% of the value of the credit.

 Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, Slovenia, the only country of the former Yugoslavia to have joined the European Union, has now taken over the Presidency of the Union. On the occasion of this historic event we would like to wish it every success with its Presidency. Nonetheless, there has never been a more pressing need to resolve the Yugoslavian crisis once and for all, be it the Kosovo issue or speeding up the accession of its Balkan neighbours. The only solution for the countries that were part of the former Yugoslavia is swift accession to the Union, in accordance with the established criteria. Peace requires an ambitious vision and, in particular, the will to move beyond the Balkans’ history and look towards a European future. To date, the Kosovo issue has not been resolved because the international community has been unable to come to an agreement. The European Union has also been a victim of this deadlock, this syndrome. Between the countries that are fearful of the effects of independence and those who dream only of validating their independence as soon as possible for various diplomatic reasons, Slovenia will initially have to ensure the cohesion of the Union by seeking first and foremost an internal compromise, if the EU’s foreign policy as laid down in the Treaty of Lisbon is not to be trivialised or even ridiculed. We know, nevertheless, that Mount Triglav in Slovenia symbolises determination and accomplishment. Let us hope therefore that it will be the symbol of 2008!

My colleagues and I backed Giuseppe Castiglione’s report on the common organisation of the market in wine by a large majority. In particular, I supported four amendments that I consider essential not only for safeguarding the European wine-growing industry, especially in Burgundy and Franche Comté, but also for making it more competitive. I voted in favour of Amendment 271, opposing the Commission plan to put an end to chaptalisation. It is, in fact, vitally important that we should maintain the wine-making traditions of chaptalisation that are carried on in many regions of Europe, including Burgundy and Franche Comté – which I happen to represent. I also supported Amendments 33 and 223, opposing complete liberalisation of planting rights from 1 January 2014: the interests of wine-growers dictate that we should wait until the end of the grubbing-up scheme, to see how effective it has been, before we contemplate liberalisation. Finally, I voted for Amendment 107, seeking to maintain compulsory distillation. In general I am satisfied with the amendments that Parliament has made; I supported this report and I hope it will have a positive influence on the Agricultural Council on 17-19 December, where the interests of our regions will be at stake.

A fundamentally important amendment to the report by Ole Christensen on common principles of flexicurity has unfortunately been rejected by the majority of the European Parliament, and I have therefore voted against the report. Amendment 41 on the promotion of a European wage policy proposed a minimum wage of at least 50% of the national average wage, and this seemed to me to be essential for combating the low pay that often leads to poverty. Harmonising the minimum wage at European level could lead to vital progress in conditions of employment for Europe’s workers. I deeply regret that this vote has sadly once again prevented social Europe from making progress towards greater fairness and cohesion.

 Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, the sand in the Kosovo hourglass is trickling down relentlessly, and 10 December is almost upon us. Unfortunately the dialogue of the deaf continues between an extremely autonomous Kosovo inside Serbia’s borders and supervised independence. The legislative elections of 18 November only increased political aspirations, with the victory of the independence supporters in a ballot marked by a record abstention. The EU must therefore come up with a strategy other than independence, thereby affirming a European foreign policy. The very word independence is a trap, a synonym of chaos for our Europe. By accepting this process we are opening up a Pandora’s box with all the nationalisms, regionalisms and localisms this implies on our own territory. In a globalised world, independence is an illusion. A call must be made to all parties to build a regional community with peaceful exchanges which duly respect democratic principles. Supporting partition and independence will simply reinforce nationalisms. Let us remember the words of President François Mitterrand to Parliament: nationalism is war, and war is not only the past, but can also be our future.

This resolution loses its impact because important amendments relating to the recognition of the Armenian genocide have been rejected by the majority of Members. I am and will remain in favour of Turkey’s accession to the European Union. However, this accession process has to recognise some historical facts. Moreover, I am totally opposed to the contradiction that Parliament has now introduced. In paragraph 5 of the resolution of 28 September 2005 it in fact called on Turkey to recognise the Armenian genocide and regarded this admission as a precondition for accession to the European Union. The decision to omit the Armenian genocide from the new resolution is a step backwards and one that I cannot support.

Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, the United Nations has set 10 December next as the deadline for determining the future status of Kosovo. However, with the Kosovan authorities threatening to declare independence unilaterally, Serbia arguing for a system of broad autonomy and Russia vetoing the UN special envoy’s proposal for supervised independence, the situation is critical. My concern is to highlight the key role that the European Union will have to play in resolving the crisis. It is our collective wish that the Union should have a High Representative for the Common Foreign and Security Policy. But what credibility can that appointment carry if we are incapable of playing our part in finding a specific solution to the Kosovo situation, which is still officially classed under foreign affairs although it is in fact a matter of internal concern to the Union? The EU therefore needs to demonstrate a sense of direction and a clear vision that reflects compromise between the Serbian and Kosovan demands, while taking care not to open the Pandora’s Box of partition; and it needs to speak out on the future of Kosovo and make its voice heard in the concert of nations.

 Mr President, I would like to draw Parliament's attention to the problem of Kosovo and, particularly, to the need for the European Parliament to be able to answer for this European internal matter and to ensure that the right of the people to determine their own future can, quite rightly, be respected. Many political elements are appearing and exerting pressure to bring about the partition of Kosovo, which is not an answer. This is very clear to us, particularly in relation to the problems associated with the Palestinian Territory and the division of that territory in 1946. Strong pressure should therefore be brought to bear, with the European Parliament, to prevent a partition, to prevent conflict from being generated in this way and to enable the people to decide their own destiny, making sure that the European Parliament can be present, present on the European stage, and also present throughout our territory.

 On Tuesday, 25 September I supported my colleague Reino Paasilinna by voting for the establishment of the European Institute of Technology (EIT). This report reflects a real desire to converge towards a knowledge society. Arranging for tools to be put in place, within the European Union, to promote the integration of innovation, research and education will eventually help stimulate competitiveness within the European economy. The activities of the EIT will be steered by a Governing Board of scientific and administrative personnel. This Board will designate the Knowledge and Innovation Communities (KICs) that are responsible for implementing the strategic priorities of the EIT. At the same time, however, it is a matter of regret that the financial resources being earmarked for this project are somewhat lacking. This could in the long term prove to be the undoing of this promising initiative. We all need to be aware of the absolute necessity of providing the European Union with Community projects that will ensure its development within the context of the Lisbon Strategy.

Madam President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, in a few days’ time a delegation from this Parliament will travel to Istanbul to take part in the 5th 
World Water Forum, an event which will bring together all the global players with an interest in water: UN agencies, development banks, States, professional organisations, NGOs and local authorities. At a time when water is becoming an increasingly scarce resource and the pace of climate change leads us to expect more and more conflicts in relation to access to water, I wanted to prepare for this meeting by putting a strong text to the vote within our institution in order to lay the foundations for European action in this field. The situation is serious, as you know. Water shortages have spread beyond the traditionally arid areas. Access to water, the quality of which is constantly deteriorating, has become a concern for all of us. The UN figures speak for themselves. One billion people do not have access to safe drinking water; two and a half billion people do not have access to sanitation; five thousand children under the age of six die every day from diseases caused by lack of clean drinking water or sanitation, or by their poor quality. The scandal is that the first victims are always the poorest. Access to water, which will be one of the main challenges in the years to come, could further delay the achievement of the Millennium Development Goals. The next World Water Forum must be an opportunity to find solutions together to respond to this enormous challenge. My first priority was to emphasise that water is a shared resource of mankind that should be a universal right. That is the first paragraph of the proposed resolution, and it is vital, because the policies we are implementing depend upon it. Remembering this basic principle means saying ‘no’ to making water a commodity, since, unfortunately, we know only too well the disastrous consequences of that. The United Nations Development Programme (UNDP) report of 2006 shows there has been flagrant injustice. The lack of distribution systems has often resulted in a lack of safe drinking water for the most disadvantaged people. Consequently, millions of people have to resort to unofficial sources which, taking into account the intermediaries, charge prices that are five or ten times higher. We are fighting for access to safe drinking water and sanitation for all. This means that water has to remain under public control, which alone can assert the common interest. It is this principle that should guide our policies, and I am pleased that the resolution makes reference to it. Public intervention is indeed able to resolve this problem of access. A pricing system that is fair and sustainable for all would be both less costly for poor people than having to resort to the unofficial sector and would allow investment in the necessary infrastructures. This goal can be achieved only if we all contribute to it. Public development aid must therefore be used together with the resources of local authorities, bank loans, private capital and innovative partnerships. I should like, in particular, to stress the importance of financing based on solidarity, such as that made possible under the Oudin law in France. The latter allows local authorities to collect one cent per cubic metre from their users’ water bills to finance international cooperative actions dedicated exclusively to water. Is the Commission prepared, Commissioner, to encourage the development of this kind of instrument? Such development has to be done in accordance with the notion of the public good, and that is why I am pleased that the text of the resolution points out that public-private partnerships must be strictly defined and subject to regulation. Since the last World Forum, the role of local authorities has been recognised by all the stakeholders, including members of Parliament and ministers. The next forum, in Istanbul, will stand out because of two major advances: the signing of an agreement by local authorities on water and the organisation of two days wholly devoted to the role of the local authorities. Are you prepared, Commissioner, to make use of the enormous reserves of expertise and of human and financial resources of the local authorities to encourage the North-South Partnership? With their successful experience and their technical skills behind them, the cities of the North are keen to help their counterparts in the developing world. Finally, the UN has today published a report on water that makes some frightening projections for the future. Under the double pressure of demographic growth and climate change, the water crisis has been made worse by the inadequacy of the political reaction. While water is the priority for all development policy, only 6% of international aid is devoted to it. That is why I want Europe, our Parliament and the Commission to send a strong message to the people of the South, because this inequality of access to water cannot continue.

The Global Climate Change Alliance must become an effective instrument enabling the poorest countries to adapt to the consequences of climate change, of which they are the prime victims. Through the Socialist Group in the European Parliament's amendments tabled in committee, it has been possible to improve on the excellent work done by the rapporteur. With regard to the funding of the Alliance, the PSE joins with the rapporteur in deploring the low level of the annual amount laid down by the European Commission. We also deplore the quasi-systematic recourse to the EDF to fund new initiatives such as the Alliance. This use ought to be strictly controlled, to ensure that it actually does finance development actions, and that it is restricted to the first year of the Alliance's operation. The Commission must therefore abide by its undertaking to find additional funds for the Alliance. The PSE has also voiced its support for the establishment of a close link between climate change and the current food crisis. The Alliance should put forward concrete initiatives on this front, such as the creation of green belts around towns in the global South in order to promote food-producing agriculture. Finally, we have called for environmental, social and economic criteria to be drawn up relating to the production of biofuels, and for food security to be guaranteed before agriculture for export is promoted.

 Following the legislative elections in Palestine in February 2006 I was one of the first to say, both from Jerusalem and in Parliament, that we should not be applying sanctions against the Palestinian Government because it would be the people who would suffer. Admittedly, we have to accept that the political situation in the Territories has completely deteriorated, especially between Fatah and Hamas, but this political crisis cannot be attributed solely to European sanctions. This is why I abstained from voting on Amendment 4. I also wish to state that I clearly condemn Israel’s persistent violation of international law, but regret that the text of the report fails to mention those violations of international law committed by other countries in the Middle East. This appears to be a case of double standards and that is why I voted against Amendment 5.

Madam President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, over the past few weeks our debates about aid effectiveness have been marked by the dramatic news of the world food crisis. That crisis is a brutal reminder that if we cannot ensure the most elementary right, the right to life and to enough food, our efforts in the area of development aid will be in vain. In his report, Mr Van Hecke, whose work I applaud, points out that a long-term strategy is the only way to give real support to the development of our partner countries. In regard to food as to public health and education, we need lasting solutions if we are to respond to the deep-rooted causes of the current crisis. The many amendments tabled by the PSE give support to the rapporteur’s position and strengthen it in some respects. We pointed out that our priority objective must be to achieve the Millennium Goals, the first of which is to eradicate poverty and hunger. To that end, and to render the aid more effective, it must be more locally owned, as close to home as possible and to the needs of the local population. That is why I pointed to the need for greater consultation with national parliaments, civil society and local authorities in regard to formulating, implementing and evaluating development policies. Similarly, it is essential that we effectively combat corruption and make the aid more transparent. In concrete terms, we are asking the Commission to produce a matrix of all the funds allocated to local governance in order to check the coherence of the policies and the sound management of those funds. Finally, because a debate on improving aid effectiveness cannot be dissociated from the question of the amount of the aid, let me again – as was done a moment ago – point to and condemn the unjustifiable reduction in public development aid between 2006 and 2007, when it fell from 0.41% to 0.38% in Europe. The Accra summit will indeed be political, as the Commissioner said. It will offer the donor countries a unique opportunity to reiterate their commitment. It is up to us to be at that meeting and not to disappoint our partners.

 Mr President, it is now six months since the demonstrations in Rangoon revealed to the world the serious human rights violations taking place on a regular basis in Burma. It seems, unfortunately, that international public opinion has already forgotten about this country in crisis. The reality is that we must provide unfailing support for the people of Burma and adopt a coherent long-term strategy to guarantee, finally, respect for democracy, for the freedom of the press and for the freedom of religion, expression and association. In spite of the diplomatic pressure, in spite of the exemplary action of Aung San Suu Kyi, who, I must remind you, was awarded the Sakharov Prize in 1990, and in spite of the efforts of international civil society, the situation has not improved: because they do not have the right to vote, 400 000 Buddhist monks will not be able to take part in the referendum. This unacceptable situation is proof that the pressure applied to date has been inadequate. The sanctions against the Burmese regime must be extended and must target the political elite rather than the population. Above all, I hope that the EU’s action will be strengthened. In order to raise awareness among the public, I ask, we ask, that Aung San Suu Kyi – who embodies this fight – be given the freedom of all the European capitals, thereby demonstrating our determination to see to it that human rights and freedom in Burma are promoted effectively.

Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, the rise of extremism in Europe is certainly very worrying and all the European institutions need to mobilise to stem the growth of these extreme right-wing movements that are becoming ever more threatening as they not only promote suspect values but increasingly attack human rights on the basis of their racist ideology. This dangerous trend in the European Union is unacceptable! As I see it, the Commission needs to respond on two fronts, reflecting the ideas expressed in the written statement and in the PSE resolution on the subject: it needs to act positively along with the Member States to identify appropriate political and legal means, on the one hand, of condemning human rights violations and, on the other, of preventing extremism, particularly among young people, by raising awareness of the Union’s fundamental values. It is also essential to ensure that no European fund can be used by an institution or organisation that promotes values, or makes statements, inciting people to xenophobic, racist violence. I would remind you here of the case of Radio Maria in Poland, which, although notorious for promoting anti-human-rights views, applied for European grant aid. I would therefore take this opportunity, in the presence of the Commission representative, to urge once again that no European funding should go to media which serve as a platform for racist ideas, with a widespread and potentially very dangerous impact on the public.

Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, AIDS remains one of the great plagues of the 21st century despite the international community’s exceptional efforts to combat it over the last 20 years, albeit with occasional periods of slackening. Number 6 on the list of UN Millennium Development Goals, adopted in September 2000, is to halt and begin to reverse the spread of AIDS by 2015. However, the current situation in developing countries – and particularly in Africa where the death rate from AIDS is still rising – demands that we redouble our efforts if we are to achieve that target. There are several potential avenues for European action here. Firstly, we can strengthen cooperation arrangements, particularly with local authorities in the southern hemisphere because it is only at local level that lasting solutions can be found with regard to caring for sufferers, preventing the disease, supplying medicines, running information and prevention campaigns, and generally managing health services so that they meet local people’s needs. Secondly, we must find ways of tackling the shortage of health professionals in low-income countries. Europe needs to step in here with practical, properly funded programmes to enable health professionals to do the work they were trained for in their own countries, under proper conditions and within proper structures, with the necessary equipment and medicines. Lastly, combating AIDS in the long term will require a firm commitment to give patients in developing countries access to the medicines they need at prices they can afford. Given that many AIDS patients in the southern hemisphere have already developed resistance to the first-generation drugs they have been treated with, it is essential to find ways of making the latest treatments available in generic form in low-income countries. For that reason I would ask the Commission specifically to ensure that bilateral and regional agreements currently being negotiated – especially EPAs – do not include any provisions that might make it harder for southern hemisphere countries to use all the flexibility available under the TRIPs agreement and the 2001 Doha Declaration for the purpose of protecting AIDS patients. I have no more to say. The unacceptable situation of millions of people dying of AIDS every year demands that the European Union face up to its responsibilities. It is time to stop talking and to get to work.

 Strengthening the European Neighbourhood Policy (ENP), as detailed in this report, requires a deepening of cooperation between the two shores of the Mediterranean via a heightened dialogue between governments, local authorities and representatives of civil society. It is also essential to remember that the ENP must follow the line set by the European Union’s development policy. Almost all the countries to the south and east of the Mediterranean are developing countries, according to the official list drawn up by the OECD’s Development Assistance Committee. Achieving the millennium development goals should therefore be a priority of EU action in the region.

I welcome the EP resolution on the Gaza Strip. The measure taken by the Israeli Government to declare the Gaza Strip a ‘hostile entity’ paves the way for economic sanctions. This measure comes at a time when the Gaza Strip is plunged into a humanitarian crisis, aggravated by the suspension of direct international aid to the Palestinian Authority and Israel’s failure to pay back taxes outstanding to the Palestinian Authority since March 2006. Even if the Israeli authorities have allowed food trucks into Gaza, the United Nations Relief and Works Agency for Palestine Refugees in the Near East reports shortages of basic foodstuffs caused by frequent closures of the Karni border crossing. We would not be faced with a humanitarian crisis of such proportions if we had not cut off our aid to the Palestinian people in the first place. Many other organisations maintained their cooperation with Palestine, particularly a large number of European local authorities. Is it not time we reviewed our policy of sanctions against Palestine so that this does not hinder supplies of the most essential humanitarian aid to the local population?

 Madam President, at this late hour, many things have already been said, but I would really like to thank Mrs Valenciano, of course, for this report. It marks an important step in making European development policy more transparent and effective when it comes to human rights. I am also taking the chance offered by this debate to call representatives of the Council and the Commission to better interinstitutional cooperation. It is indeed essential to institute a dialogue between the Council, the Commission and Parliament so that action taken in the area of human rights can be better coordinated, and to prevent contradiction and duplication from interfering with the message to the outside world. It is unfortunately an issue permanently in the news. To take a specific example, that of Burma, our policy concerning the country is indecipherable from the outside. The members of the EU have committed themselves to a common position in favour of national reconciliation, democracy and human rights, but in practice the EU Member States are divided, producing a weak and ineffective position that is having no effect on the regime in Burma. Politically, the European Union has no clear strategy. We concentrate only on humanitarian aid, which is obviously essential, but not enough. We have not taken a position on how the UN Security Council should deal with the situation in Burma, offering no support for a resolution. Moreover, the Commission has reduced the amount of subsidies for projects aimed at promoting human rights and democracy in Burma. In short, the European Union has not used its influence positively and effectively to promote and support democracy and human rights in that country. The recent failure of our call for the release of the Burmese Nobel prize winner, Aung San Suu Kyi, proves this. Yet Parliament awarded her the Sakharov Prize in 1990. This example perfectly illustrates the fact that our three institutions must act together in presenting a coherent, intelligible policy for the defence of human rights.

Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, democracy has lost ground in Nigeria. The elections of Saturday 21 April, which were marked by fraud, violence and deaths, will not have been free or fair. All the international observers, as you said, have confirmed this. These elections were meant to be a test. For the first time since the country gained independence, in 1960, a democratically-elected president could have hoped to succeed another. This is a missed opportunity! It does not bode at all well for Nigeria, at a time when the country, rich though it is, needs stability if it hopes to escape poverty. Since the elections, the violence has increased: the international community has a duty to intervene. I should like to remind you that, last year, the European Parliament awarded the Sakharov Prize to Mrs Hauwa Ibrahim, a Nigerian lawyer who courageously defended two women who had been sentenced to death by stoning for having committed adultery, for the Sharia is still observed in that country. On 28 and 29 May, a coalition of opposition parties, civil society and trade union organisations, including the Nigerian lawyers’ union, will organise a two-day movement to protest against the staging of these elections. The European Parliament must support this democratic movement. It is by doing so that we will defend Nigerians and Nigeria, a large and important African country.

Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I should like first of all to thank Mr Rocard for this report, which conveys much objectivity on the European Union’s exclusively bilateral relations with the Arab world. It calls, however, in particular for a new dialogue, which must include the problems of development and of good governance. It is to this subject that I should like to return. In its development policy, the European Union has broken up the Arab world into two parts: the Mediterranean zone and the Caucasus, called the neighbourhood zone, and the Middle East subject to the development policy. This artificial distinction does not allow a more balanced comprehensive approach, which would make fundamental reforms possible. As far as the matter of governance is concerned, Mr Rocard emphasises the partnership approach and the role of civil society. This is an innovative view that must take into account – and this is why I am speaking of it – the role of the local authorities. In fact, a very dense network of cooperation from town to town has developed in the Arab world, with the organisation of Arab towns which, moreover, belong to a wider organisation, the world organisation of towns, which includes Palestinian towns and Israeli towns that work together. There are cooperation projects for peace, for cultural and religious exchanges, for human rights and the fight against all forms of discrimination. These transnational actions are the expression of a link between Europe and the Arab world on an infra-state scale, that of emerging civil societies. They also offer a wider framework for analysis than that of the fight against terrorism imposed following 11 September.

Mr President, I took the initiative for this report because I am convinced that, at a time when European aid is being reformed, it is essential to give local authorities a central political role in development cooperation. This is an important year: in 2007, 50% of the world’s population live in towns, and that figure is obviously going to increase very quickly. Local authorities are experts in all fields of local development, and the United Nations has already recognised their central role in the realisation of the Millennium Development Goals. In Europe, however, our consultation stops at civil society organisations. I think that that is unsatisfactory. While the involvement of civil society is necessary, especially that of NGOs who work most closely with local communities on the ground, local authorities have a specific added value. First of all, they are in most cases legitimately elected over the whole territory. This democratic legitimacy is an advantage in enabling us to improve local democracy and good governance on the ground. Secondly, they have expertise in the management of public services, such as water, health care, education, town planning, waste management, the environment, etc. Finally, they have a territorial approach. They know the local development problems specific to each region and each community. Their active involvement in European development policy would allow aid to be better distributed over the whole of the territory and better targeted according to the specific needs of each area, whether it be rural, urban, maritime, mountain, desert or any other kind of area. In view of these observations, my report sets two major challenges for the future of European cooperation. I have not worked out my strategy on my own. For more than four months I consulted the largest international and European local authority organisations in order to obtain their analysis. My report is, in fact, the result of these analyses. The first challenge: we believe that local authorities must become full political partners of the European Union alongside central governments and civil society organisations. By partnership, I mean the development of a structured political dialogue between the European Commission and local authority organisations. This dialogue must be active, as much here, in Brussels, as on the ground in developing countries. In Brussels, we want the Commission to put in place a platform for dialogue modelled on CONCORD, the European NGO Confederation for Coordination of Relief and Development. In developing countries, in accordance with the new development instrument and the revised Cotonou Agreement, it is a matter of involving local governments at each stage of the development strategy right from the stage at which strategy documents are drafted for each country. The second challenge: this report makes several financial proposals to the European Commission. Firstly, we believe that decentralisation must be a priority for the European Union and, consequently, that it has to become a focus for European Union financial aid. In many countries decentralisation is constantly increasing. Local authorities have more and more powers, without having the financial capacity to carry out this new role. Secondly, we propose that part of the aid budget should go directly to these local authorities. Indeed, our recent debate showed the extent to which aid can pose a problem in these countries, where there is a higher risk of corruption. Decentralising budgetary aid would make it possible, on the one hand, to distribute it more effectively over the whole territory and, on the other hand, not to concentrate it all in the same hands, thereby ensuring better management of European funds. Lastly, we believe that the involvement of these local authorities and of non-State actors is necessary in order to ensure that European aid fulfils the real needs of disadvantaged populations. We therefore ask for an increase in the budget for the thematic programme, non-State actors and local authorities. In conclusion, Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I should like to emphasise what is, in my opinion, the main issue in this debate. Our cooperation policy does not take sufficient account of the territorial dimension of development, and, as Kofi Annan said at the Millennium summit, while the Millennium Development Goals are global, it is at a local level that we can provide solutions. The answers are local and specific, according to the territory. If we do not take that into consideration, our aid is liable to remain concentrated in the hands of a central government and not to be distributed in the country as a whole. The former President of Benin, Mr Soglo, recently said to me that, at the time of his Presidency, he thought that aid was distributed fairly in the country, but that, now that he is mayor elect of Cotonou, he realised that this was not the case. I am pleased that the new development instrument recognises the need to involve local governments in the political dialogue. It remains now for this commitment to be reflected on the ground and for local governments to be given the means to fulfil their new responsibilities.

Mr President, I am pleased that our committee has taken the initiative to speak about the effectiveness of budget aid. The report – which is fairly critical – contains many reservations. I share each of those reservations, and I should like to illustrate them a little more. In the strategic documents by country that we are currently monitoring, we see that the budget aid provided by the Commission is often like a black box – it is impossible to evaluate. For example, in the case of Cambodia and Laos, the Commission is proposing to allocate 40% to 60% of the entire budget to the national anti-poverty programme, without giving the slightest indication of which sectors will actually be funded. Even more worrying is the fact that, when the Commission reveals to us the sectors that it once funded in its programmes, we see that they were not directly contributing to the fight against poverty. Under the guise of funding for national development programmes, the Commission is actually funding measures designed to improve the business, investment and trade climate. Consequently, it is not enough to make budget aid more sectoral and conditional in nature; the Commission must genuinely aim to fulfil the objectives of reducing poverty and of achieving the Millennium Development Goals. That is why, if such excesses are to be avoided – and I propose this whenever I can because this is my firm belief – a significant percentage of budget aid must be decentralised, for the benefit of NGOs and local authorities. This would mean preventing central governments from managing and monopolising all of the European budget aid. Decentralising aid would enable us to give the populations access to European funding and thus to make sure that our financial support is really benefiting the populations on the ground.

Madam President, the situation is shocking, scandalous and unacceptable. This is a second death sentence for the Bulgarian nurses and the Palestinian doctor. The Libyan justice system has once again shown that it is iniquitous and that its judiciary exploits politics for its own ends. The AIDS affair is nothing but a poor excuse. Faced with the seriousness of the fundamental rights violations committed by the Libyan authorities and with the failure of all the steps taken, we must react firmly. I should like the EU Member States to join forces against Gaddafi’s regime, to speak with one voice and not to give in to any of the regime’s blackmail. In this way, the Member States could seize the opportunity of the European tour planned by Colonel Gaddafi to agree to refuse him the right to enter EU territory until the medical personnel have been released. We must make it clear to the Libyan regime that the EU Member States will all support Bulgaria and will all act with the same determination that they would demonstrate if this matter directly affected their own nationals.

Madam President, please allow me to stress the curious aspect of this parliamentary consultation procedure. Our institution has been invited to give its assent to the conclusion of the revised Cotonou treaty, which was signed back in June 2005. By issuing our opinion today, we can only therefore approve something that has already been concluded. Nevertheless, the decision-making process with the ACP countries would benefit from being enriched by the participation of the European Parliament. Indeed, during the negotiations on the development cooperation instrument (DCI), we demonstrated our very significant added value and our capacity to defend interests other than those of the Commission and the Council. Having said that, I believe that the revised Cotonou Agreement represents considerable progress, particularly with regard to the role of local sectors in development policy: for the first time, their role has been clarified, and they are explicitly recognised as full partners in the political dialogue. We have just obtained the same recognition for the DCI. The great development challenges are faced at local level. The time has come to decentralise our development policy. Access to water, healthcare and education are social services provided locally by bodies that are close to their citizens. If European Union funds remain blocked at central government level, there will be no effective aid to benefit populations directly. That is one of the reasons why I welcome the adoption of the revised Cotonou Agreement. We must now remain vigilant in order to ensure that it is implemented.

Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, this resolution is a step in the right direction. I should like to add that the fight against AIDS is also an issue of governance, which must be dealt with at local level. I would remind you that in 2007, that is to say at present, 50% of the world’s population live in cities. In many African cities, prevention and health care require local authorities to be involved in making those same cities more responsive to local needs and in removing social taboos, which are often very powerful. We must cooperate directly with the cities in order to help them manage their health services and in order to provide them with increased funding. I should have liked our resolution to have put forward a larger number of practical solutions to be employed on the ground. We could have asked the Commission to make it easier to offer combined treatments in the form of medicines combining three types of remedy in one and the same capsule – an arrangement that would have greatly simplified the treatment of patients living in areas in which hospitals, medicines and laboratories are few in number. We must promote the use of such treatments, ladies and gentlemen, as we have a pressing duty: to achieve the Millennium Development Goals.

Mrs Lehtomäki, I should like to begin by thanking Mrs De Keyser for this excellent report. The conclusion of an association agreement between the European Community and Syria would constitute a very encouraging political sign in terms of establishing peace in the Middle East, which is something that we all so earnestly desire. Association agreements are an excellent way to put pressure on countries. Thus, in return for our economic and commercial cooperation, we must ask Syria to become a democratic country that respects fundamental freedoms; to stop interfering in its neighbours' affairs; to strictly delimit its border with Lebanon; and to stop supporting the Hezbollah militias or the Hamas fundamentalists that it is sheltering. Syria must release the intellectuals, human rights defenders and political prisoners that it is holding in its prisons. It must also respect the right of the minorities living on its territory, especially the Kurds, to whom it must offer citizenship, since they do not have it. If Syria renounced its Greater Syria project and if it turned to allies other than Iran, the entire region would benefit. Syria, more than any other country in the region, is able to play the role of governor and peacemaker, particularly in relation to the Iraqi and Palestinian issues. Europe must make every effort to include Syria among its strategic allies in the Middle East. If the wind of change rose in Syria and if the country practised a policy of openness, then all of the populations in the Middle East could finally start to free themselves from the yoke of dictatorship and theocratic populism.

Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, a lot has been said, but I think that this resolution that has been put to the vote is well balanced. It presents the facts in some detail but without ever pronouncing judgment and so avoids the pitfall of siding with one or other of the protagonists. I regret that our resolution reduces the causes of the Israeli-Lebanese war to the Israeli-Palestinian conflict. As General de Gaulle used to say, you cannot go into the Middle East, complicated as it is, with just a few simple ideas, and that is the message that I too want in a way to convey. Like all of us, I want to see the Israeli-Palestinian conflict resolved, but do you really believe that this will reduce tension within Lebanon and put a stop to Syrian interference and Iranian ambitions? Moreover, will Hezbollah be disarmed as a result? It is the insecurity and the growing suffering of the Israeli population of Galilee that have triggered hostilities against Hezbollah. This state of permanent threat has been fostered not only by the Israeli-Palestinian conflict but also, and above all, by Hezbollah’s constant firing of rockets into the north of Israel. Israel’s fears are all the greater insofar as the Hezbollah militias are armed by a powerful Iran whose democratically elected President constantly makes known his desire to wipe Israel from the map. This is a man who must now be taken seriously, which is what I, for my part, do. Consequently, I do not think that the two causes should be confused. In the north, Lebanon is concerned to regain its sovereignty and put a stop to the interference by its various neighbours, while Israel wants to guarantee its security. In the south, meanwhile, the task is to create an independent Palestinian state within secure borders that is able, over time, to co-exist in peace with its neighbour, Israel.
 Pierre Schapira (PSE

Mr President, I am amazed by what I have just heard, and I regret that some people here still confuse Jews with Israelis. We would not be facing such a huge humanitarian crisis if we had not started by stopping our aid to the Palestinian people. The Council of Ministers’ decision to cut aid and to endanger the Palestinian people was a serious mistake. There were other ways to apply pressure. Since the suspension of that aid, has the Hamas Government made the slightest progress in terms of recognising the State of Israel? Has it finally decided to condemn the attacks? Not only has this policy of using the humanitarian crisis for the purposes of blackmail had no positive effect whatsoever, but it has actually led to suffering. We are once again in a cycle of violence in which wrong is clearly being done by both sides; rockets fired into Israel, disproportionate reprisals by the Israeli army, the seizing of the soldier Shalit, who of course must be released, as everybody here has said. Many players have continued to cooperate with Palestine. I am thinking in particular of the many European local groups who met in Brussels last week. Furthermore, as President Brok said, the Quartet must allow intervention on the ground. Finally, allow me to express my great regret at the fact that the European Parliament's resolution voted on last month made no reference to the statement of the Palestinian prisoners, because I believe that that text is the most encouraging sign for the Palestinian authority led by Mahmoud Abbas, which we must support.

 Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, once again I am very pleased at the change to the legal basis of the stability instrument, and am grateful to the Commission and the Council for having accepted this change. I am also pleased that the negotiations with the Council made it possible to restrict the scope of the stability instrument by limiting cooperation in the fields of peacekeeping and anti-terrorist activities. Nevertheless, the Commission's proposal aiming to establish a non-compulsory call-back mechanism does not make up for the deficiencies in Parliament's power of codecision on the political content. With regard to the Mitchell report, I am delighted that Parliament has not yielded to the Commission or the Council. Tomorrow, we are going to vote on a text that maintains Parliament's powers and allows it to retain its role as colegislator regarding the political direction to be taken by the new cooperation and development instrument. There is no reason to yield because this power is an established right. Indeed, the political guidelines on which we want to secure codecision will replace 16 regulations that underwent the codecision procedure. Now that the initial battle has been fought, we expect the Commission to propose a policy soon so that we can complete the second reading before the end of this year. Nevertheless, I am concerned about the neighbourhood instrument. It raises the same problems as the development instrument, but the response provided is considerably different. As in the case of the Development Cooperation and Economic Cooperation instrument (DCECI), this instrument is subject to the codecision procedure but has no political content. As in the case of the DCECI, the political content to be defined will, for 15 of the 17 countries covered by the neighbourhood instrument, replace around a dozen subject-related regulations subject to the codecision procedure. In an effort to retain its competences, Parliament itself proposed the call-back mechanism to express its opinion on the political content of the neighbourhood instrument within the framework of the codecision procedure in the case of differences with the Commission. We are an elected assembly and our work is, by definition, political. We have chosen, though, to legislate on the most technical aspect of the partnership – the procedural framework – but to keep our peace on the political strategy. Today, we are prepared to give up the call-back mechanism and to yield to the Commission and the Council in order to adopt this text at first reading. Why should we go back on an established right? Why should our legislative power be curtailed at a time when Parliament is achieving significant legislative victories in other areas, such as port services, the Services Directive and, tomorrow, the DCECI? I understand that we need to reach a speedy compromise on this instrument with the Council and the Commission, but how can any elected representative vote to lose his prerogatives?

Mr President, I should like to begin by making some observations. Firstly, the demographic problem has been at the heart of the political debate; secondly, the Great Israel utopia is no more; thirdly, the social issue has been at the heart of the debate in Israel; and, fourthly, Hamas did not influence the elections in Israel. Unconsciously, the Israelis have once and for all acknowledged the existence of two States. It is now time for negotiation, but pressure must be brought to bear on Hamas so that it invalidates its Charter and finally recognises Israel as a valid negotiating partner. Otherwise, ladies and gentlemen, there will be a unilateral policy on both sides. Public opinion in the two countries is in favour of peace. Europe must take advantage of this situation because it now has a crucial role to fulfil. Europe has expectations riding on it and, as regards aid for the Palestinians, I repeat that Europe must continue to grant its aid, otherwise a disaster will ensue in Palestine.

Mr President, the World Water Forums represent a unique opportunity to bring together all those groups in the world that are involved with water, be they official agencies, development banks, states, professional organisations, NGOs or local authorities. These meetings make it possible to define a fairer and more unified world water policy and to ensure that people’s right to water is upheld as a crucial element of human dignity. The organisations have chosen to steer the debates in Mexico City by establishing ‘Local Actions for a Global Challenge’ as the main theme of this forum. The aim is to make local authorities the central actors with regard to water management. In order for this to happen, developing countries must be encouraged to delegate the budgetary resources and the management of water policy to their local authorities. Water policy should always be developed on the basis of the specific nature of the terrain and by taking account, as far as possible, of the users’ needs. Parliament’s resolution calls on the Commission to do more to acknowledge and make use of the fantastic level of human resource and financial expertise present in Europe’s local authorities. With a wealth of successful experiences and technical skills behind them, the towns of the North are keen to help their counterparts in developing countries. In order to facilitate these cooperation operations that are decentralised from town to town, the Commission is requested to encourage and prioritise the funding of projects presented by towns of the North. As far as the allocation of resources from the European Water Fund is concerned, the Commission could, in particular, restrict eligibility to receive these funds to those operators best placed to help the authorities of the South. The results of the first call for proposals by the ACP-EU Water Fund show that scarcely 3% of the projects accepted were projects presented by local authorities. That is highly unsatisfactory given the added value that local authorities provide in this area.

Mr President, personally speaking, I feel bound to point out the link between the comments by President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad calling for Israel to be wiped from the map and Iran’s decision to resume its uranium processing activities. I do not believe that these two events are coincidental. Neither do I believe that our institution can reasonably overlook the correlation between them. Many countries are developing their nuclear capabilities, but the international community is only worried about proliferation in those countries that pose an immediate threat to peace in the world. I believe that, if Iran does not inspire confidence in us today, it is because, amongst other things, its President makes bellicose, revisionist and anti-Semitic comments. It is that President’s malevolent intentions that make the resumption of the uranium enrichment programme so worrying in terms of world peace. That is why I am delighted with this resolution.

Madam President, I wish to thank Mr McMillan-Scott and Mrs De Keyser: the elections went smoothly in every way. Over and above that, these are historic elections: this is the first democratic change in the Arab world. The Palestinian people did not vote in favour of Hamas, it voted against Fatah. Hamas won on the basis of a programme centred on the fight against corruption and on the reform of the PLO, the only organisation authorised to negotiate. Above all, it won on the basis of a social programme to be implemented specifically within Palestine. Those were my specific impressions when, away from our mission, I met the Palestinian mayors and their association, which is dominated by Hamas. As for aid, we must continue helping the Palestinian people, make sure that officials are paid and, above all, prevent the State from collapsing, otherwise the Palestinian Authority will fall into the hands of another country. It is imperative that we wait, ladies and gentlemen, but let us not become naively optimistic. Read the Hamas Charter: it is despicable and disgraceful. It must be rendered null and void so that the new government can become a discussion partner. We have to set a date – a schedule – so that Hamas faces up to its responsibilities, because it has become a legitimate party in a democratic country.

 Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, I am pleased with this resolution on the European neighbourhood policy. It comprehensively covers all the priorities set by Parliament for this policy: human rights, democracy, immigration, the environment and free trade. However, one vital subject is completely missing: development cooperation. Let me remind you that, of the 17 countries covered by the neighbourhood policy, 12 are developing countries, and a third of those are regarded as low-income countries. The current reform of the external action instruments means that these 12 developing countries will not be covered by the future cooperation and development instrument. As a result, if the neighbourhood policy does not include a development policy, these 12 countries will no longer get any development assistance from us. I find it regrettable, however, that a text with as general and broad a political focus as this one makes no reference to cooperation. We cannot reasonably talk about increasing the prosperity of a region without, at the same time, making a commitment to eradicating poverty. Are the basic needs of the people of Azerbaijan, Moldova or Palestine currently being met? How can these countries fight dictatorship and be competitive in the market economy when some of their people do not even have access to drinking water, social services, healthcare and basic education? How do we expect to achieve the Millennium Development Goals if we cannot even combat poverty on our own doorstep? As I see it, adopting a resolution on the neighbourhood policy that chooses to overlook the objective of eradicating poverty would be a serious error of judgment for which, unfortunately, we would have to bear responsibility in the future.

Mr President, many things have obviously already been said. I should like to raise one point. HIV/AIDS is impacting directly on millions of people and improving health is an absolutely essential prerequisite for Africa’s development. To combat it as effectively as possible, we need to offer women, men and adolescents a complete range of care and services. We need to guarantee access to irreproachable information and education on sexual and reproductive health, make training women a priority so as to make it easier for them to make decisions on issues of sexuality and reproductive health, and thus offer them the means and methods necessary to protect themselves from HIV infection. Just 1% of those infected with HIV/AIDS benefit from antiretroviral treatment. We need to do all we can to widen access to generic AIDS drugs. The timing of this report could not be better. We are working within the framework of the Millennium Development Goals. I will be voting in favour of this text, provided that no amendments alter it significantly.

 Mr President, I am rather surprised at the direction this debate is taking, because the discussions are focussing very much on identifying additional sources of finance. Even if we are right, I wonder whether this debate is not obscuring the real issue, which is that before we discuss the amount of aid we grant, should we not first endeavour to improve the quality and effectiveness of existing aid? This question is all the more important because the discussions on international taxation or on the creation of international financing mechanisms will remain rather hypocritical, as long as the United States and the great majority of the international community will not accept these mechanisms. Equally, the amount of effort put into looking for new means, while we have still not achieved the objectives of the Monterrey Consensus, the priority given to improving the effectiveness of existing aid in order to achieve the Millennium objectives, and the scattering of resources and objectives in development policy all diminish the effectiveness of aid. We must be careful not to get involved in this headlong rush; we need to concentrate on looking for practical solutions that will allow us to meet our current commitments. Let us be specific and pragmatic – that is what the people we want to help expect.

 Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, there is a Yiddish saying, ‘Remember, and do not forget’. It is crucial for our fellow citizens to understand the uniqueness of the Holocaust, and we must be extremely vigilant faced with the resurgence of anti-Semitism. I am also a little surprised to see only the word ‘racism’ on the notice board, when the title of our colleague’s, Mr Schulz’s, oral question was in fact ‘Anti-Semitism and racism’. I am surprised that the title is not given in full. The living memory of the generations of survivors will shortly die out. Hence, the need for the institutions to pass on the memory of the genocide to younger generations. I should like to submit a practical proposal to you. I suggest that the European Union require all schools to affix commemorative plaques to their walls, bearing the names of those former pupils who were deported and did not return. A ceremony in memory of these children could be organised on 27 January of each year. In the same way, I propose that plaques denouncing the collaboration that took place be placed outside police stations, law courts or regional administrative offices that issued deportation orders and whose officials were cowardly enough to allow the anti-Semitic barbarity to be perpetrated. If we allow the horrors of the past to sink into oblivion, future generations will not understand the need to combat the questioning of universal values of tolerance and freedom.

 The issue of rail interoperability is critical to the development and the success of Europe’s railways. I am therefore very pleased that we have been able to reach a compromise in the interest of improving Community legislation in this area. Although I voted in favour of the proposals put forward by the rapporteur, Paolo Costa, I am not any less aware of the limits of this compromise. Ten years to achieve the certification of all types of rolling stock is a considerable amount of time. As for the role of the European Railway Agency, it could have been much more extensive, particularly with regard to the development and implementation of the European Rail Traffic Management System (ERTMS). The Member States decided otherwise for fear of seeing the railway agencies and other national bodies – newly established, it is true – doomed to obsolescence. However, if this is where we are at now, then it is because, back in 2004, they did not have the courage to give a truly European impetus to the railways. This is how European integration proceeds: in fits and starts and in small steps. However, if we adopt this cautious approach, we are likely to miss some opportunities, which is why I hope that the Member States will play the game by rigorously applying what they themselves have proposed.

 A majority of the European Parliament has today adopted the proposal for the Returns Directive. This proposal for a directive, which is aimed at establishing minimum common standards for the treatment of illegal immigrants, was originally intended as a response to the often tragic situation encountered in the 224 or so detention camps scattered around Europe. It is a sensible initiative, since we know that some countries have no rules or limits whatsoever for the detention of illegal aliens. During the vote in committee the Socialist members made significant progress in laying down essential guarantees on human rights, which were absent from the initial proposal. These have now been removed by the Council and the PPE rapporteur, as it appears that they prefer a more repressive package in the hope that it will discourage those who are already in a state of despair. The result is a Directive that ratifies a process for criminalising migrants, cramming them together under appalling conditions for prolonged periods on end and separating minors from their families, while the so-called guarantees of the right to legal aid and appeal will in fact be left to the discretion of the Member States. This is quite simply unacceptable and contrary to the values that Europe claims to represent. This is why I decided to vote against the text.

 Madam President, one of the aims of the first European Maritime Day we are celebrating today is to buff up the image of the maritime occupations by restoring their future prospects. In addition to the improvement of working and employment conditions for these occupations and the redefinition of career plans, a number of structural conditions also need to be met. Today, throughout France, desperate fishermen are blockading ports because they no longer believe they have a future. In addition to the fishing restrictions aimed at protecting fish stocks – the principle of which I am not querying, though I do wonder about its fairness – rising fuel prices are now also threatening them with bankruptcy. This is already a problem in France but it is likely to spread to other parts of Europe in the near future too. The European Union can and must act in this area by supporting restructuring and encouraging the introduction of cleaner-burning, more fuel-efficient vessels. As a matter of urgency, it must also help companies affected by this economic crisis to stay afloat. I highlight this last point because we cannot let the first European Maritime Day coincide in the minds of citizens with the death of an entire trade.

 The European Commission certainly finds it hard to abandon the stereotypical approaches it applies to all sectors indiscriminately. Wine cannot be treated like spare parts for cars or some other industrially manufactured product. It is a product that shapes regions, cultures and ways of life. As far as the COM reform is concerned, if it is necessary it must preserve European winemaking, not get rid of it or disfigure it. It must support the adaptation of wine producers – particularly the subsequent restructuring of sectors – and give them the means to reconquer the internal market. Nor should planting right restrictions be lifted. They provide a guarantee for control of production and continued quality. In relation to crisis management tools, if the EP improves the situation with respect to the Commission’s initial proposal, I can only regret that crisis distillation – which, if compulsory, would not create the excesses we are seeing now – is no longer an option among the possible instruments for handling temporary crises.

I voted for the Ortuondo Larrea report on the recast of the Interoperability Directive, for interoperability is the key to revamping our European railway system. Rail transport, in fact, can only become competitive again – compared with road traffic in particular – if it moves up to a continental scale, and this mainly depends on the ability of trains to cross borders. Even though the administrative obstacles have been largely removed, we are still left with some very real technical obstacles. Thus I am very glad that this text was agreed at first reading, since urgent progress must be made in this field. The text, which now makes rail interoperability a political priority, should represent a great leap forward for European railways.

I voted in favour of the Gutiérrez-Cortines report because it proposes positive steps forward for the protection and sustainable use of soil – a non-renewable resource which it is vital to preserve, and the quality of which is crucial if we are to ensure adequate levels of food production and access to clean water. The European Parliament has called for clearer identification of contaminated sites where dangerous substances, present as the result of human activity, constitute a significant risk to health and the environment. National or regional lists of such sites will be compiled and they will be available for the public to consult. Each Member State will have to prepare remediation strategies so that the number of contaminated sites can be limited, and sustainable agricultural policies will be encouraged, taking account of national soil characteristics, so that clean soil can be preserved. In adopting this report the European Parliament is underscoring the need to protect the earth’s resources and use them more wisely.

Mr President, allow me to begin by thanking the rapporteur, Mr Braghetto, for the excellent job he has done. As the ICCAT negotiations are still ongoing, we do not yet know what fate has in store for our fishermen next year. What we do know is that something very serious happened this summer and that we shall have to undertake a thorough review of the arrangements for monitoring catches. The Commission, I am glad to say, has that task in hand, although I fear that some of the measures proposed last month for eliminating illegal fishing will not go down too well with the Council. I hope that, whatever happens, the Community Fisheries Control Agency will succeed in introducing proper coordination of European efforts to carry out the necessary checks, because the national monitoring systems are not working. It is all very well for our Spanish, Portuguese and Greek friends to sound off about the behaviour of the French and Italian fleets and the failure of monitoring in those two countries. Everyone knows the true picture! We are all aware that every country has concealed the illegal activities of its own fishing fleet for too long. That is why – like it or not – we need tougher control at European level, and that is why I am convinced we need a European coastguard. We also need to discuss sanctions for this overfishing. It is very likely that ICCAT will decide to penalise the Community, and then we in turn would have to penalise those Member States that are at fault. The French Government has made loud noises about refusing to compromise and has warned that heads could roll. Personally I hope these sanctions – which would not have been necessary if the monitoring systems had been effective – will be tough but fair and balanced. I also hope that those engaged in traditional tuna fishing – which has less impact on stocks – will not be punished for the faults of others. Lastly, since the experts have clearly established that European fleet capacities have been disproportionate to the bluefin tuna stocks, I want to take this opportunity of asking the Commissioner what resources are to be allocated to retraining those fishermen who will have to go out of business.

I voted in favour of Parliament’s 2008 budget motion because it proposes distinct improvements to the draft budget put forward by the Council. A balance has been struck for 2008 between financing, on the one hand, for external policies such as support for Kosovo and Palestine and, on the other, for Galileo, a project that binds the Member States closer together. The European Socialists’ priorities are thus well reflected in Parliament’s position on the EU budget for 2008 at first reading. I would point out, however, what a modest budget this is: it currently represents no more than 0.99% of the Union’s GDP. This is the first time that the budget has dropped below 1% of GDP. Yet the Union cannot act in the interests of its citizens if it lacks the resources to do so. It is time that the Member States shouldered their responsibilities here.

 I voted in favour of the Klaß and Breyer reports on the use of pesticides because they signal progress towards better consideration of the impact on the environment and health of the use of plant protection products. In particular I welcome the adoption of the socialist proposal to prohibit the use of pesticides in residential or sensitive areas. I am also delighted by the adoption of our proposals on the systematic promotion of non-chemical techniques. However, I am sorry that the European right has opposed the introduction of targets for reducing the use of these products. There are many examples demonstrating that reduction is possible, and a gradual reduction strategy could have been introduced without endangering the industry and jobs. Once again, the right has given preference to profits… However, small steps count, and these reports are a step in the right direction towards the sustainable agriculture of tomorrow and a healthier environment for our children.

 With this ‘Blue Paper’, the European Union is taking a step forward. Though it is regrettable that on certain points – like the issue of European coastguards and a European flag – the European Commission has had to scale down its ambitions because of a lack of support from certain Member States, this document is a good basis to start from. I hope it will keep all its promises. However, the issue of finance will be decisive, something the Commission itself recognises. Will our ministers shoulder their responsibilities? For the rest, I am particularly delighted by the Commission’s decision to address the revision of social legislation in the maritime sector, to which traditional employment law and its protections do not apply. It was about time! This decisive factor in making maritime careers attractive should therefore help Europe to protect its maritime expertise.

 I voted in favour of the report by my colleague Mr Casaca because it clearly underlines the perverse effects of the current system, which sometimes causes decisions to be taken that are disconnected from local realities. Take, for example, the case of thonaille fishing in the Mediterranean. Those who do it have made efforts to develop their fishing methods, but legislation adopted recently is putting disproportionate restrictions on them that are in danger of causing their disappearance. They are in fact facing unfair competition from their colleagues in the Eastern Atlantic, both Spanish and French. In accordance with the report’s proposals, an approach using geographical fishing areas and taking account of the specific features of the techniques employed would have made it possible to ensure a fairer distribution of fishing effort capable of guaranteeing a sustainable balance between fishing capacity and fishing opportunities.

 While I am delighted about the adoption of the own-initiative report by Mrs Ayala Sender on logistics, which underlines the importance of intermodality for cleaner and more sustainable transport, I can only lament the adoption of paragraph 21, against which I had already voted in the Committee on Transport and Tourism. I voted against this paragraph because 60 t goods vehicles, to which this paragraph has just opened the door, are dangerous for the environment and for the users of our roads, which were not designed to carry these loads. The road lobby’s arguments are fallacious: as the load capacities of current HGVs are already underused, the reduction in pollutant gas emissions that people are trying to lure us with on the basis of ‘fewer vehicles for more transported goods’ is a trick. As for the impact of these juggernauts on our infrastructure, it will eventually land on the shoulders of taxpayers by causing an explosion in road resurfacing budgets. Finally, regarding road safety, apart from the risks posed by damage to infrastructure, the very size of these road-using monsters represents a danger for all other users.

Mr President, I must first of all convey to you apologies from my colleague, Gilles Savary, who has been held up in Bordeaux. At a time when the future of the public postal service is being decided, I should like to highlight one particular point: that of the financing of the universal service. The proposal before us today is to replace what is left of the residual monopoly and serves to finance the universal service in a way that is simple and transparent, with an array of complex systems that are hardly transparent and of which the sole merit would be to ensure free and undistorted competition in the postal sector. This array, however, includes compensation funds and we know that they are an open door to constant litigation and public subsidies which can lead to proceedings against Member States or a system called ‘pay or play’ which has never been tried and which could also open the door to endless disputes. Basically, this white elephant that is being set up is the consequence of a purely ideological choice, which has nothing to do with the real efficiency and quality of the postal service. In the end, this system will lead to a progressive reduction in the range of the universal service and to the end of the uniform tariff while having a definite effect on jobs and administrative costs. That, we cannot support. The postal service, especially in rural areas, is more than simply a commercial service, it constitutes a tool in the service of social and territorial cohesion, and dismantling it is not the way to reconcile Europe with its citizens.

Madam President, first of all I should like to thank Willy Piecyk for the impressive work he has carried out in providing an overview. In the end it is a complete, balanced report which takes into account the economic, environmental and social dimension of this future maritime policy. As regards social matters, it underlines the importance of professional training and career prospects, as well as the pressing need for Member States to rapidly sign and ratify the International Labour Organisation (ILO) conventions relating to maritime employment. Such a requirement is vital if we do not want European expertise in this field to disappear. As for the rest, the ball is in the court of the Commission and the Member States. Regarding the latter, the reform of the European Union budget from 2008 should give them the opportunity to show that they take these issues seriously. As for the Commission, its task will be the coordination of this maritime policy. It is about a huge work site where the lack of any solid line could quickly lead to chaos. That is why I think that the idea of a Commissioner with responsibility for maritime policy, who has a sufficient mandate to arbitrate when necessary, deserves to be considered. Of course, solidity should not mean rigidity. Also, to give the flexibility necessary for the implementation of the initiatives that will be decided in the context of this future maritime policy I think that it would be appropriate for the regions to be closely associated.

Mr President, at a time when we are drawing up the statement for the first railway package, we have to recognise that we are still far short of the target. In spite of the progress achieved and particularly the fact of having stemmed a decline which seemed unavoidable, rail’s modal share remains still too weak. It is all the more unfortunate because in these times of climate change the choice of rail sees its relevance confirmed every day by what is happening. We know what the reasons are for this mixed statement: we have staked too much on opening up, the contributions of which cannot be denied, without worrying enough about the technical barriers, in particular the lack of interoperability, knowing that this ought to have accompanied the opening up gradually, instead of lagging further and further behind. This situation is probably due to the fact that in general liberalising does not cost the Member States very much, while harmonisation is a different matter. Today at the very moment when we are at last beginning again to tackle the problems of interoperability, it therefore seems to me worrying that, under cover of co-modality, the objectives of modal shift towards rail, in particular, move into the background. Instead of revising the objectives downwards, we ought to have revised the intellectual as well as the financial means upwards. I hope that this report will contribute therefore to reminding us of the way we have still to go in order to give back to rail the place it deserves.

Mr President, we are currently in the middle of the Erika trial. The Erika case is typical of those disasters that are avoidable but that nonetheless happen because the gains of a handful of individuals must necessarily take precedence over everything. That is the outcome of liberal logic, of profit pushed to the extreme, according to which, for the sake of making a few euros more, everything is permitted, including disregarding the most elementary safety rules to the point of catastrophe. It is this same logic that we have seen at work in the miserably famous case of Irish Ferries
, which soon will have nothing Irish about it except its name. In the name of profit, the entire staff complement of a company, which is nonetheless operating correctly, can be thrown overboard. Again it is this same logic that pushes some shipowners carrying out intracommunity cabotage to operate ships with insufficient crew and in conditions that put both the crew and shipping as a whole at risk. These miserable working conditions go so far as to jeopardise seafaring traditions and expertise because the image they give of the sector is such that it has become more and more difficult to recruit European seamen. Of course, this pursuit of profit is never mentioned. It is better to put forward the argument of international competition, which is essentially Asian and obviously unfair, to justify these practices, even when this competition does not exist. Has anyone ever seen Chinese companies operating ferries in the Baltic or in the Channel? There is no question of denying this competition. It does affect part of the sector and it also has its merits, but it must be controlled and it must be fair. It is possible to choose the basis on which it should operate. And if, sadly, social dumping is a reality in the maritime sector, it is not inevitable. There are, of course, those who accept it and seek to profit from it, but one can also reject it by pushing for a general rise in social standards in the world as a whole so that, in the end, everyone can find themselves on an equal footing in terms of international competition. That is, as you will have realised, the way that I would like Europe to go. In Europe, as we know, competitiveness will not be achieved through minimising costs and lowering social standards. It can only be achieved through quality. The quality of vessels, the quality of crews, safeguarded by means of decent working and training conditions. The ILO Convention that is being discussed this evening offers us the opportunity to make that choice. It does not solve all of the problems, but it represents a step forward. And it offers European shipowners and the Member States an opportunity to demonstrate their commitment to defending certain values enshrined in the European Union and in its social model. On signing it in February 2006, they were signing a statement of intent in that regard. We now expect them to move on to actions. As far as shipowners are concerned, I can only welcome the fact that they have given their firm and willing commitment to entering into social, European dialogue, with their trade union partners, with a view to signing, by the end of the year, a collective European agreement that would include the relevant provisions of this Convention. An initial cycle of negotiations has ended today and the climate seems very constructive. This is a good thing and I think that we can also welcome the constructive role played by the European Commission in facilitating this process. As for the Member States, they hold the key to bringing this Convention into force. It has been said, if the European Union and the European Free Trade Association ratify it, then the Convention will come into effect and will apply everywhere. If Europe ratifies speedily, other nations will follow, and Europe will have been the driving force, in showing that another way, apart from exploitation and dumping, is possible, and that competition can go together with responsibility. It is essential, therefore, if we believe in the unique quality of the European model, to see to it that this Convention is ratified speedily. It is also essential to keep to the target date of the end of 2008 proposed by the ILO.

 Mr President, honourable Members, ladies and gentlemen, I would like first of all to thank the rapporteur, Mrs Wortmann-Kool, for her work, both on my own behalf and on that of my friend Mr Savary, who was unable to be present to take part in this debate this evening and who has asked me to give you his apologies. It is a balanced report, and while it does not include all the views expressed by my group, it is still acceptable, since it stresses the most important things. It asks for the speedy publication of guidelines by the Commission so as to afford greater legal certainty to those providing international tramp and maritime cabotage services. It also points out that exchanges of information are important and may be beneficial for the stability and efficiency of these sectors. It brings useful detail and, lastly, gives particular importance to small operators. As a member of this Parliament’s Committee on Transport, I would nevertheless like to express a few regrets, stressing one point in particular. Together with my colleagues Mr Savary and Mr Sifunakis, I tabled an amendment concerning the legal basis of the text on which Parliament is to vote tomorrow morning. That amendment was rejected by the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs. As a result, it could not be submitted for the vote in plenary. I deplore that. Regulation (EEC) No 4056/86, which this regulation proposes to repeal, was adopted on a twofold legal basis: Articles 84 (transport policy) and 87 (competition) of the Treaty, now Articles 80 and 83. The proposed repeal takes up only Article 83 (competition). That is a political choice with serious consequences. It in fact determines the procedure applicable and limits the powers of Parliament, since the legal basis relating to competition alone involves a consultation procedure. The legal basis relating to transport, on the other hand, would have resulted in a codecision procedure. In my opinion, that would have been preferable. While I think that competition may be stimulating and beneficial to the economy, I do not see it as a panacea and am not in favour of its blind and indiscriminate application to all sectors of the economy, with no regard to their specific nature or even the state they are in. Sadly, the Commission’s Directorate-General for Competition has sometimes given us the impression of defending that rather dogmatic outlook against all comers and especially against the opinion of other Commission services. Although it is a consultative document, I hope that this report will at all events give the Commission a better picture of the concerns of operators who are not against the idea of reform, but who would like some guarantees and guidance regarding the changes with which they will be faced. These are legitimate concerns, and all the more so because this sector is of fundamental importance for Europe’s future and its development.

 Mr President, I will keep my comments very brief. I will simply remark that the Commission envisaged EUR 740 million to fund 'Marco Polo II' and that the European Parliament's Committee on Transport and Tourism voted in favour of that sum and restated its keenness to secure proper funding for the programme. However, we now have a proposal for EUR 400 million over seven years, with new priorities that need to be funded, eligibility thresholds 50% lower and twice the geographical scope. Just as in the case of the trans-European transport networks, we are spreading ourselves very thinly. I rather doubt that, under these circumstances, the hoped-for trigger and lever effects will materialise, and I find that deeply regrettable, all the more so because 'Marco Polo II' is a programme that has already proven itself to be effective. Now more than ever, Europe must keep its promises if it is going to regain people's trust. We are not going to manage it with this kind of budget, though. Even though I welcome the efforts made by the members of Parliament's Committee on Transport to limit the reduction of this funding, I cannot vote in favour of this report, and I will be abstaining in the final vote.

 Mr President, I should first like to congratulate the rapporteur and my fellow members of the Committee on Agriculture and Rural Development on this report, one of the strong points of which is that it emphasises a key concept, which is that Europe’s farming will only survive on the basis of quality. Consequently, at the heart of any political measure taken by the EU, not least in international fora such as the World Trade Organisation, must be the defence of labels and other protected designations, as this is the only way of guaranteeing the sustainable competitiveness of European products in a globalised world. I personally come from a region that has more than 30 products registered under the protected designation of origin (PDO), protected geographical indication (PGI) and traditional speciality guaranteed (TSG) schemes. These designations are without question an asset for the producers who benefit from them. It is a similar idea to one we have always used in another sector, which does not fall under the scope of this text but which requires support and protection from Europe. I refer, of course, to the winemaking sector, which accounts for tens of thousands of jobs in my region, southern France, and hundreds of thousands of jobs around Europe, and which is currently enduring a major crisis. If nothing is done, including at European level, there is a danger that Europe will lose its soul.

 Mr President, Commissioner, Mrs Kratsa, ladies and gentlemen, tomorrow Parliament will be voting on the contents of the White Paper. The Commission will be presenting its legislative proposal next Wednesday. Is it already ready? We can only hope that the echoes of our debates will reach the Commission nevertheless. It would be a pity if they did not, because the report we have before us, late as the hour sadly is, is of a high standard. I would like to thank Mrs Kratsa for the quality of her report and for her courtesy. No one here disputes that healthy competition needs to be introduced into maritime transport, where most of the players are private operators. Do we need to go so far as total deregulation, however? That would be to overlook the changes that have taken place in the last few years and to deny the benefits of the present system. As a result of the Court of Justice’s and the Commission’s decisions, maritime conferences have in fact ceased to be cartels. They play a useful role, ensuring the stability and quality of the service and strengthening maritime safety through the regular renewal of fleets. They also guarantee the diversity of operators. Having said that, the present system can still be improved. The exchange of information could be rationalised. There is also a need for clear rules for calculating excess loads. On the other hand, it seems to us dangerous to repeal Regulation 4056/86 without proposing even a provisional replacement. Simply abolishing the present system would accelerate concentration in the sector. Reducing the number of operators could have a negative effect on services to some ports and on prices. We understand review to mean ‘improvement’ not ‘repeal’. That is the message that Parliament should be sending to the European Commission and the Council with this report. We hope it will be heard.

 Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, I am a newly elected Member of this Parliament, and this own-initiative report is therefore my first report as an MEP. Before setting out the main points, I would like to thank the Committee on Transport and Tourism, and my political group, the PSE, for giving me the task of working on the very important subject of short sea shipping and motorways of the sea. I would particularly like to thank the administrators of the European Parliament, Mr Darmis and Mr Préat, and my parliamentary assistants, Mr Caballé and Mr Polack. They have supported me throughout the process of consultation, analysis and drafting leading to this report. Finally, I would like to express my thanks to the services of the Commission’s Energy and Transport DG and to the main professional players working in the sectors concerned, in particular the ship-owners, logistics experts and ports that played an active role in our consultations. I would like to take this opportunity to express my surprise at the lack of human and financial resources available to MEPs for investigations. The European Parliament, with the continual growth of its budgetary and legislative powers, has become the voice of the citizens within the European Union. I was therefore surprised to discover that an MEP, as a rapporteur, cannot organise observation missions financed by the European Parliament other than the official missions of the parliamentary committees, which take place only once or twice a year. As you know, the devil is in the detail and, if the European Parliament is going to be effective in its supervisory role, it will in future need to benefit from increased levels of in-house expertise, in particular so that the independence and impartiality of its Members can be guaranteed. First of all, let me remind you of the context surrounding the issue of the development of maritime transport in Europe. In its White Paper on European transport policy for 2010, published in 2001, the European Commission highlighted the important role to be played by short sea shipping in reducing greenhouse gas emissions and stressed the need to simplify the regulatory framework. It introduced the concept of motorways of the sea, pointing to the need to promote mass rapid maritime transport links providing a way around the bottlenecks posed, for example, by the Alps and Pyrenees. The European Parliament supported these proposals for short sea shipping in its report on the White Paper, adopted on 2 January 2003. The rapporteur for that report was Mr Izquierdo Collado. The Commission’s most recent communication, which was published in 2004 and which we discussed, is primarily a mid-term document; its aim is to review the situation in short sea shipping, the obstacles it encounters and the actions taken to resolve them. The intention of my report is firstly to provide you with an overview of short sea shipping in Europe. I would like to draw your attention to two main facts. Firstly, short sea shipping’s share of all intra-European transport rose by 25% between 1995 and 2002 and now accounts for 40% of all goods transported within Europe, as against 45% for road transport. Secondly, recent data regarding the environmental impact of short sea shipping show that it has a much smaller negative impact than road transport. The conclusion to be drawn from this overview is clear. Our task is to promote short sea shipping, in order to reconcile protection of the environment, quality of life and economic growth. However, there are a number of obstacles to the growth of short sea shipping. I do not want exhaustively to list here all the obstacles that I stressed in my report, but I would like to point out to you two main issues. Firstly, this report stresses the lack of a real interventionist policy aimed at attracting and guiding the major road transport organisers and operators to short sea shipping. Secondly, our meetings with managers within the sector have convinced us of the urgent need to set up clear, effective, adequate funding mechanisms for the actions that need to be taken. The various existing sources of funding should enable optimum complementarity, making it possible to launch durable new lines. In view of these obstacles, my report lays particular emphasis on the need to settle the issue of the standardisation of intermodal loading units and to facilitate the integration of short sea shipping into the supply chain. We also suggest relaunching the Community debate on the unification of the legal system for the multimodal chain. This report was approved unanimously by the members of the Committee on Transport and Tourism. Our consultation work enabled us to reach compromises on crucial points. The report emphasises the potential for increasing the use of short sea shipping for passenger transport, the opportunities to create thousands of jobs, the importance of links between short sea shipping and inland waterways, the importance of short sea shipping for islands, compliance with Community competition rules and, finally, improving the environmental performance of short sea shipping. As a correction and in the interests of consistency, I would like to propose a purely technical oral amendment. The aim of this amendment is to bring the definition of short sea shipping in recital A, in which we included passenger transport and inland waterways, into line with that in recital C, in which we neglected to do so. My amendment therefore adds the words ‘and passengers’ and ‘or inland waterway’ to recital C, so that the definition of short sea shipping is the same throughout the report. By way of conclusion, I would like to remind you of what I think are the three main reasons why I am asking you to support my report on short sea shipping and the motorways of the sea. First, widespread use of short sea shipping running through all sectors of the European economy would have an extremely positive impact on the development of all regions in the European Union and would be a fantastic way of creating hundreds of thousands of jobs across the continent. Secondly, short sea shipping is one of the solutions that will enable us to reconcile protection of our natural heritage with economic and social development in our regions. Finally, short sea shipping has an essential role to play in regional planning and in strengthening regional cohesion within the European Union. In that respect, I believe that the concept of motorways of the sea should be fully integrated into the issue of strengthening solidarity within the EU. That is why this report proposes, on behalf of the Committee on Transport and Tourism, that consideration should be given to the option of recognising that high-priority projects in the field of short sea shipping, which plays an important part in improving regional cohesion within the EU, are services of general economic interest. I hope I will be able to enjoy the widest possible support in Parliament on a subject as important as the growth of short sea shipping and of intermodal transport. In this way, the European Union’s policies on environmental protection, regional development and regional cohesion will be strengthened for the well-being of our fellow citizens and future generations. I therefore hope that I can count on your broad support.

 Mr President, as shadow rapporteur on the recast of the Dublin Regulation, I wish to thank the European Commission for the quality of the text proposed to us. It does in fact bring significant improvements to the Dublin system, in particular from the viewpoint of respect for the fundamental rights of those seeking international protection. Highlights of these advances include the strengthening of the principle of family unity; the additional attention paid to minors and the concept of the best interests of the child; the guarantee of better information and of means of appeal for those seeking international protection; the strict limitation of the use of detention; and the option of temporarily suspending transfers to Member States whose reception facilities are under particular pressure or do not provide an adequate level of protection. When the Committee on Civil Liberties, Justice and Home Affairs voted, we succeeded in blocking the Group of the European People’s Party (Christian Democrats) and European Democrats, which wanted to get rid of some of these provisions, including the one for managing the holding in detention of asylum seekers. This is in fact an essential guarantee for us, since those seeking international protection are not criminals, and there is therefore no reason to put them behind bars. However, some of the points in the report remain problematic, not least the question of which language should be used to give information to the applicant. In our view, it must be a language that the latter will understand and not one that he or she is thought to understand. I would add that, where a person is held in detention, this is what is provided for by the European Convention on Human Rights. We also wish to see requests from minors with no parent on Union territory examined by the Member State in which the latest request was submitted, to avoid minors being transferred from one State to another. This was provided for in the Commission’s initial text, but the PPE, with the rapporteur’s support, opposed this proposal. Finally, as the Dublin Regulation is not aimed at ensuring a fair distribution of responsibilities as regards the examination of requests for international protection, it seems essential, in my view, for other instruments to be created in order to strengthen solidarity, as you said, Commissioner Barrot, with the Member States located at the Union’s external borders.

 Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, I must firstly congratulate the rapporteur, Mr Parish, on the quality of his work and the importance that he placed on cooperation with the shadow rapporteurs. Before we vote tomorrow at first reading, I want to go over the main lines of this report. Nowadays, the negative image that animal experimentation can have among the general public confirms the indisputable importance of this issue. Like me, you will have also received, over the last few weeks, a large number of letters from worried citizens. However, while we have a duty to propose a text that takes account of the public’s fears, we must not, for all that, neglect the demands of researchers. I must underline the fact that we cannot forget that researchers are not only legitimate representatives of this public opinion, but primarily people whose role is absolutely fundamental within our society. You must be aware that, in the last 20 years, the number of animals used for scientific purposes has not increased, despite the fact that the number of scientific publications in the area of biomedical research has doubled every two years. In order to understand the challenges involved in revising this directive, I myself have met with many stakeholders representing the various opinions on this issue. To my mind, the initial text proposed by the European Commission was really moving away from the fundamental aim in using animals, namely to make advances in research. It was therefore essential to put the issue of human health back at the heart of the discussions. Clearly, the provisions on animal experimentation must be amended, but European research must not, however, suffer negative consequences from this new legislation. The strategy that I adopted, and which has been taken up by the rapporteur, therefore involved rebalancing this proposal to ensure that researchers are not harmed. Based on the report adopted in the Committee on Agriculture and Rural Development, I believe that we can arrive at a coherent and reasonable text, which I hope will be broadly supported by Parliament.

 Madam President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, Madam President, you are in the chair for this sitting, so I am therefore speaking in your place on this matter that you have followed as draftsman. I would like first of all to offer my heartfelt congratulations to Baroness Ludford for the energy she has put into and the results she has obtained from the difficult negotiation of this matter. I believe that Parliament can be proud of the results obtained, because the task was far from easy, as we have observed. I would stress in particular two points which seem to me to be essential and with which we can be particularly satisfied: first, the increase in the age limit for taking the fingerprints of minors, from six to twelve years. Second, the establishment of the principle according to which the collection of biometric data by the consulates of Member States can be subcontracted to private bodies only as a last resort and within a strict framework of certain very specific guarantees. I know that some people believe that the adopted solution does not entirely fit in with the options that we had proposed, particularly regarding collection by a service provider, in a diplomatic office, and data transfer via encrypted electronic mail, or even via encrypted electronic data carriers transported in a diplomatic bag. We would reply, however, that collection by private bodies may be carried out only in accordance with European legislation and that the data must be fully encoded by the service provider and transmitted to the authorities of the Member State. Moreover, we have obtained the reference to the need for agreements to be negotiated with third countries that prohibit the encoding of data transmitted via electronic means. The examination of applications, any potential interviews, the authorisation procedure and the printing and insertion of visa stickers will be carried out only by diplomatic or consular representatives. The same conditions apply for the transmission of collected data from one Member State to another in the case of co-locations; in other words the representation of a Member State by another in a third country. Finally, if the detailed conditions for the activities of service providers are described in an annex to the text, they must be defined as a whole by a binding legal instrument. In the light of these results, we can only be delighted with the guarantees obtained in terms of introducing a better visa policy in Europe. The latter will certainly benefit the European public and will enable us to improve our relations with third countries.

 The report on which we must reach a decision on Thursday attempts to respond in practical terms to the difficulties of millions of our citizens who are suffering increased food prices. In a context of decreased purchasing power in Europe, it was important that Parliament reach a decision on a problem for which the solutions are, nevertheless, known. In fact, the difference in prices between the beginning and  the end of the food supply chain can be as high as a one to five ratio and, even if the liberals still refuse to admit it, the problems of the market need tackling to ensure reasonable prices for consumers and decent revenues for farmers. I myself have proposed that the importance of market-regulation instruments – more necessary than ever in the face of the crisis that we are going through – be reaffirmed in the text. However, to ensure that ‘accessible price’ does not become another way of saying ‘poor-quality product’, I have also asked for the notion of incentives for organic sectors to be inserted into the report. It is desirable for consumers to be able to access quality products at reasonable prices, and this thanks to an ambitious policy of financial incentives aimed at this type of agricultural production.

Right from the start, I, as shadow rapporteur for the Socialist Group in the European Parliament for this report, have had serious reservations about the usefulness and the effectiveness of the entry/exit system mentioned in the European Commission’s communication. Implementing such a system, which is directly inspired by the ‘US-VISIT’ Programme, would mean making huge investments only to see very uncertain results obtained with regard to the fight against both illegal immigration and crime. This is what the US experiment shows, in any case. Moreover, the planned measures, which are based on the massive collection of personal data, pose risks to the protection of privacy in my opinion. This view is shared by the European Data Protection Supervisor. The adoption of a number of my amendments, which were aimed at highlighting doubts concerning the need and the proportionality of the system and at criticising the culture of suspicion that increasingly pervades decisions relating to external border management, have led me to endorse the report in plenary. At a time when the global economy is plunged into crisis, there are, without doubt, other priorities for the European budget.

In view of the seriousness of the situation in Gaza, the European Parliament could not remain silent. I have therefore given my support to this resolution which calls for an immediate and permanent cease-fire, including the ending of military action on the part of Israel in the Gaza Strip and an end to the firing of rockets by Hamas on Israel. However, I am sorry that no firm and unreserved condemnation has been included of the attacks by the Israeli army, which have already left more than 1 000 people dead, mainly civilians. Although I agree with what Martin Schulz, Chairman of the Socialist Group in the European Parliament, said before the vote when he reiterated that these attacks are inadmissible, I would have preferred this indignation to have been expressed in writing. Similarly, although the motion asks the Israeli authorities to guarantee uninterrupted delivery of humanitarian aid and free access by the international press to Gaza, it does not, as I would have wished, go as far as to make the upgrading of EU relations with Israel conditional on compliance by the State of Israel with humanitarian law. Europe has a major role to play in the resolution of this conflict, but an agreement for lasting peace between the Israelis and the Palestinians can only be achieved, in my opinion, with the creation of a viable Palestinian State, recognising and recognised by Israel.

This report on the CAP and global food security provided us with a fantastic opportunity to reflect on how we can ensure that European agriculture plays a full part in achieving the planet’s food balance. Indeed, although food needs to continue to increase in the world, the proportion of development aid devoted to agriculture has, for its part, been on a constant decline since the 1980s. That is why I tabled a number of amendments within the Committee on Agriculture and Rural Development that are aimed at making this report more ambitious and, in particular, at proposing that the European Commission adopt a comprehensive strategy on food security issues, thus making the Union’s Community policies as a whole more consistent. While I am delighted that this text emphasises the CAP’s crucial role in achieving the objective of food security, I regret that the rapporteur is in favour of aligning agricultural policy more with the market and that she accuses environmental protection initiatives of being responsible for a reduction in agricultural production within Europe. This statement is in my view completely misguided, and, on the contrary, I feel it is necessary to take hold of the climate-change problem in order to develop new models that are designed to produce more and better.

For more than three years now the Council and the European Union have been at loggerheads over this Working Time Directive. The agreement reached by the EU’s 27 employment ministers provides for a maximum 48-hour working week, but with an option of a derogation allowing this to be increased to 65 hours per week in certain cases. A solution such as this is unacceptable, and, as a socialist, I have a duty to ensure that the concerns of millions of workers are heard and to fight to ensure not only that this 48-hour limit admits of no exception, but also that on-call time is taken into account in the calculation of working time. I shall therefore vote in favour of the Cercas report, in the hope that, should conciliation take place, we arrive at a text that strikes a real balance between worker protection and optimal work organisation. As European socialists, we shall, in any case, continue to defend workers because, now more than ever, Europe needs a social model that meets the needs of the most vulnerable citizens and especially of those most affected by the consequences of the economic and financial crisis.

Mr President, I should like to begin by thanking the rapporteur and shadow rapporteurs for their spirit of cooperation. This directive is the first major text concerning legal immigration. It aims to promote the arrival on EU soil of highly qualified workers from third-party countries, the great majority of whom, at present, prefer to go to the United States or Canada. Thanks to the Blue Card, these workers will now be able to take advantage of numerous rights for themselves and their families. Of course, we run the risk of being accused of supporting the idea of selective immigration, but I wish to point out that it is the Council that is systematically opposed to a horizontal directive applicable to all immigrant workers. The Commission therefore had no other option if it was to hope to move forward slightly in the field of legal immigration than to start with highly qualified workers, for whom it knew it would be easier to obtain the agreement of the Member States. Obviously I regret this sectoral approach, but we, in the Socialist Group in the European Parliament, have for so long been denouncing the exclusively repressive nature of European policy regarding immigration and calling for a legal immigration policy worthy of the name that I feel it is important to validate this first step. Let us not forget that other texts are already in the process of being prepared concerning, for example, seasonal workers and trainees.

 I should first like to commend the remarkable work carried out by our rapporteur, Mr Capoulas Santos, who has continually sought to find a balanced and stable compromise to enable the European Parliament to speak with one voice in the face of a divided and uncertain Council. The health check we will be voting on today represents an extraordinary opportunity to substantially reflect on how we can free the common agricultural policy (CAP) from the dissatisfaction undermining it and to look ahead to the huge amount of work to reform this policy, planned for after 2013. The CAP undeniably needs a breath of fresh air, and particularly in social and environmental terms. In this regard, I am delighted that we have managed to amend the European Commission’s text in the direction of increased social sensitivity, by proposing, in particular, an increase in aid for small farmers and the introduction of ‘work’ and ‘employment’ factors in the rules for allocating aid. I am sorry, however, and it is the only reservation I will mention, that the economic and social criteria are not accompanied more by ecological considerations, since ‘sustainability’ must become the hallmark of our agricultural policy.

Mr President, today we are debating two related issues: the Australia-European Union agreement on the transfer of passenger name record data – PNR – and the setting up of a European PNR system. The agreement entered into with Australia seems to us far more acceptable than other agreements entered into with countries outside the EU. Thus, it is particularly welcome that data has been made anonymous and that limits have been placed on the transfer and further use of data. We are also particularly pleased that the Australian authorities have confirmed that it is not worth collecting sensitive data such as food preferences. We do, however, still have some concerns, since the purpose for which the data can be used is not very well defined. Additionally, the length of time for which the data is kept and the number of items of data requested seem to us excessive. Finally, I believe it is vital to have a clearer definition of the data protection that will cover European citizens. We also call upon the Council and the Member States to step up democratic control by involving the European Parliament before agreements are finalised. The issues raised by the agreement with Australia show the problems that are posed by the setting up of a European PNR system. We must not be satisfied with merely responding to requests by countries outside the EU. The European Union ought to set an example by continuing its traditional protection of citizens' private lives. We refuse to simply adopt an identical copy of the PNR agreement entered into with the United States for the European Union. We need to have an open debate to ascertain whether the use of PNR data is genuinely useful and, if so, under what conditions.

 Mr President, before anything else, I would like to thank all my fellow Members who have worked with me on this dossier, because our cooperation has been truly excellent throughout the procedure. The text we will be voting on today is a particularly sensitive one because talking about combating terrorism spells danger for the rights of European citizens, whether this danger comes from the terrorists themselves or from the freedom-destroying potential of the measures adopted to combat the problem. The scale of the terrorist threat has indeed had the potential to be exaggerated in recent years by certain governments in order to justify the adoption of security policies, whether domestic or international. The threat is nevertheless real and the European Union must play its part in the efforts made to prevent and combat it as resolutely as possible. The security of its 500 million inhabitants and the defence of the essential values and principles on which it is founded depend on this. Since the attacks of 11 September 2001, EU territory has itself been the target of terrorist attacks on a number of occasions, with dramatic consequences, as we are all aware: in Madrid in March 2004 and in London in July 2005. You will all have heard of the wave of attacks that took place only yesterday in Cantabria. The increasingly sophisticated and diverse tools and methods used by terrorists make the task much more difficult. The development of information and communication technologies, particularly the Internet, makes it easier to organise terrorist networks and spread propaganda or even training manuals online. There are currently believed to be around 5 000 websites of this kind. Hence the European Commission’s entirely legitimate wish to adapt Community legislation to try to prevent not only actual terrorist attacks, but also the preparations for these attacks. In order to do this, it has drawn direct inspiration from the Council of Europe Convention on the Prevention of Terrorism. The problem is that it has chosen to take up only the repressive aspects, ignoring the provisions relating to the protection of fundamental freedoms, which constitute the essential counterweight, according to the Council of Europe. My concerns were mainly linked to the concept of ‘public provocation’ and the risk this poses to freedom of expression because, by criminalising this, things people say or write that are alleged to have led to an act of terrorism, or are simply likely to do so, will be punishable. At the round table organised in April in collaboration with national parliaments, we noted that we were not alone in expressing reservations about certain aspects of the Commission’s text. Several national parliaments expressed doubts about the application of this framework decision and the scope of the concept of ‘public provocation’. The Council of Europe also highlighted the danger of leaving out safeguard clauses. Finally, within the framework of various studies, independent experts expressed their reservations, particularly about the definition of ‘public provocation’ and about the level of legal certainty of the text. Under the impetus of a handful of national delegations particularly concerned about the protection of fundamental rights, the Council itself added a number of safeguards to the text of the framework decision. On one or two specific points, however, it also proposed the tightening up of the framework decision and, in any case, work was still needed to reach an entirely satisfactory level of legal certainty and protection of freedoms. With our fellow Members from the Committee on Civil Liberties, Justice and Home Affairs, we have therefore tried to find a balance between these two apparently opposite but fundamentally inseparable objectives, namely the fight against terrorism and the protection of fundamental rights and freedoms. In order to do this, we have had to perform a delicate balancing act, all the more so because it is sometimes difficult in practice to work out where freedom of expression ends and the violation of people’s rights begins. Think about the outrage caused two years ago by those Danish cartoons, or more recently by the controversy aroused by the short film on Islam by Dutch MP Geert Wilders. Having said that, I believe that the compromise we have reached is a good one. The principal changes we have made are as follows: firstly, the replacement of the term ‘provocation’ with the term ‘incitement’, which is more precise and is used more frequently in legal language; secondly, a stricter definition of ‘public incitement’, which more clearly delineates the behaviour to be criminalised and therefore prevents any abuses that would lead to the restriction of freedom of expression; thirdly, the incorporation into the text of many provisions relating to the protection of human rights and fundamental freedoms and, in particular, freedom of expression and freedom of the press; fourthly, a reminder of the need to guarantee that the measures taken are proportionate to the aims pursued, which is essential in a democratic, non-discriminatory society. Those are the main points of this dossier. I am delighted that this subject was chosen as the priority for this morning’s plenary and I am looking forward to a rich and lively debate.

 Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, I would first like to thank all my fellow Members who have spoken this morning for the high standard of their speeches. The sheer number of them clearly demonstrates the level of interest in this issue. Without going back over all the various speeches in detail, I would just like to mention three or four of them. Mr Fava clearly showed what a difficult exercise this is. We need to avoid a culture of suspicion and mistrust, but at the same time we need to think about the context and to guarantee both the security of citizens and the protection of freedoms. Mr de Grandes Pascual explained clearly the added value of the definition of terrorism, saying that the definition we were using was more important, and also insisting on the list of offences. As this is about working together to combat terrorism, we need to send a firm message, while protecting individual freedoms. Mr Demetriou, you mentioned the scourge that terrorism represents, and which we need to combat. However, you used the term ‘public incitement’, saying that it was a concept better understood by all the Member States. Mrs Ludford also shares this concern. She also felt the term was more appropriate, given that we do need to safeguard fundamental freedoms. The report is indeed the outcome of a long and tricky negotiating process. I do believe, though, that we can be satisfied with the result, particularly from the point of view of the balance between combating terrorism and respecting fundamental freedoms. The report by my colleague Mrs Roure falls firmly within this second category, since the protection of personal data is one of its key components. I have just one regret, which I know is shared by many people in Parliament, particularly my fellow Members in the Group of the Greens/European Free Alliance. It is the fact that the implementation of a text with such a big impact on the freedoms of European citizens is not subject to the full jurisdictional control of the Court of Justice. For this to be the case, it would have been necessary to adopt the framework decision under the Treaty of Lisbon regime. Even before the ‘no’ vote in the Irish referendum and question mark over the entry into force of the new Treaty on 1 January 2009, the Council clearly had a desire to move as quickly as possible to avoid the switch to codecision. In the Committee on Civil Liberties, Justice and Home Affairs we nevertheless tried to work in the most conscientious and detailed manner, while keeping up with the pace set by the Council. At the vote in committee on 15 July, my draft report was adopted by 35 votes to 4 with 1 abstention, and I hope it will attract a solid majority in plenary too.

 Mr President, I wanted to say that Mrs Roure is the shadow rapporteur for this report. She could not be here today and so I am speaking on her behalf and on behalf of the Socialist Group in the European Parliament. I share the comments made by the rapporteur, whom I thank for his work. This situation is in fact totally unacceptable. The launch of SIS II is considerably behind schedule. We have already had to extend the Commission’s mandate once until the end of December 2008 to carry out the migration. The Commission has again fallen way behind schedule and is now asking for an unlimited extension of its mandate to carry out the migration. This seems unacceptable to me, as any future consultation of the European Parliament on this issue would then be impossible. However, we do not want the migration of SIS to SIS II to be rushed, since this would impact on the quality and security of the data and of the system as a whole. Consequently, every precaution must be taken to ensure that data is protected and that the system is secure. This is why we could agree to moving the calendar back and extending the Commission’s mandate to carry out the migration properly. However, there is no way that this process can continue without democratic scrutiny by the European Parliament. This is why the PSE Group supports the rapporteur, in order to safeguard the powers of the European Parliament.

 I am delighted by the adoption of this report, which highlights the role played by marketing and advertising in the emergence and perpetuation of gender stereotypes and proposes a number of avenues for combating these. The development of awareness actions seems to me, for example, to be a worthwhile measure, particularly with regard to children, who constitute a particularly vulnerable group. Exposure from a very young age to gender stereotyping in the media makes a major contribution to the perpetuation of lifelong inequalities between women and men, hence the importance of developing children’s critical faculties with regard to images and the media in general. I also agree with the notion that marketing and advertising have a major responsibility for the increase in the number of people suffering from eating disorders and should consequently be more careful about the choice of female role models. However, it is a pity that the proposal aimed at explicitly integrating the fight against gender stereotypes into existing or future codes of practice, giving those working in the sectors concerned responsibility for ensuring the commitments are adhered to, was not upheld by a majority.

I must firstly thank Mrs Lambert for the quality of her work. The report on which we must decide tomorrow has the dual merit of taking a very clearheaded look at the imperfections and problems of the Dublin system and of formulating proposals to improve the efficiency of procedures and the situation of asylum seekers. I should like to stress a number of points that, in my opinion, are fundamental: the need to reinforce the rights of asylum seekers and guarantee these in the same way across the whole EU territory; the fact that detaining asylum seekers should always be a decision of last resort and duly justified; the need to ensure better distribution of asylum applications as the current system places a disproportionate burden on those Member States situated at the external borders of the EU; the need to take measures against Member States not guaranteeing an in-depth and fair examination of these applications, and finally, the importance of family reunification and a broader definition of the ‘family member’ concept, to include all close relatives.

The document that has been adopted today constitutes a total rethink of the work that was done in the LIBE Committee, which had paved the way for a significant improvement on the Commission’s original proposal. This so-called compromise will in effect not bring about any changes likely to improve the degree of protection afforded to persons living in those Member States that have the least acceptable immigration policies. The first reason for this is the restricted scope of the document: asylum seekers and persons who have been detained at border controls are excluded from it, even though they represent a significant proportion of all illegal immigrants. Another more relevant reason is because it gives Member States far too much latitude when it comes to key questions such as the rights of minors and the length of the detention period. The latter has now been extended to 18 months, as compared with the six months proposed by the Socialist Group in the European Parliament. I am ashamed that a majority in this House has supported the idea of locking up for such a long period people whose only crime is to have come here in search of better living conditions and who are often in an extremely vulnerable state. I have voted in all conscience against the document. If some basic common rules are indeed necessary then these should be drawn up as part of a responsible and humane approach to illegal immigration and on no account should they be introduced at the cost of sacrificing the fundamental rights and values that we hold dear.

I voted against this report, which in purporting to lay down common rules for the internal market in electricity is in fact proposing to dismantle the heritage of Europe’s traditional operating networks. Separating electricity production and electricity distribution will in my view provide no additional guarantees as to the efficiency, security or accessibility of the network, particularly in the present situation of a sustained growth in global electricity demand and major uncertainty over resources. This latter factor calls for even greater structural investment in order to safeguard our supplies and promote research and innovation, a prospect that seems to be largely incompatible with the philosophy of strong competition and short-term profitability that underlies the decision to move towards the total deregulation of this sector. The ‘third way’, which is supported by the French Socialists but regrettably was not adopted, appears to be a much more sensible solution since it allows us to preserve the patrimonial integrity of Europe’s large energy groups while at the same time placing the organisation of electricity distribution in the hands of independent regulators. Nevertheless, I welcome the progress that this report represents as far as consumer protection is concerned, particularly the introduction of rules for combating energy poverty and for ensuring transparency and accessibility to information for the end user.

 The text to be put to the vote tomorrow constitutes a clear step backwards, not only in relation to the Commission’s initial proposal, but above all in relation to the work done within the Committee on Civil Liberties, Justice and Home Affairs, of which I am a member. We socialists are in favour of introducing minimum rules concerning the return of illegally staying nationals because we support a responsible, humane approach to illegal immigration and realise that some EU Member States are pursuing unacceptable policies in this area from the point of view of respect for fundamental rights. We have no choice, however, but to point out that the compromise supported by the conservatives and the majority of the liberals does not bring any improvements in this area. It does not apply either to asylum seekers or to those people intercepted at borders. Above all, it gives Member States far too much leeway on key issues such as the rights of minors and detention periods. Accordingly, the detention period could be extended to as much as 18 months. Like many of my fellow Members, I refuse to support the possibility of locking up, for such a long time, people whose only crime is to have wanted to seek a better life in Europe. That is why, if the amendments of the Socialist Group in the European Parliament are rejected, I will vote according to my conscience and against this text.

I welcome the adoption of this report, which highlights the fundamental challenge generation change in the agricultural sector poses for the European Union. Young farmers are those who are best placed to respond to the new agricultural challenges. Having benefited from the experience of their elders, they have the necessary dynamism and enthusiasm to carry out the crucial environmental, technological and economic changes that will enable tomorrow’s European agriculture to retain a prime position in the world. We now need to reconcile an increasing level of agricultural production with constant respect for product quality and safety, within the framework of a global approach based on the preservation of natural resources and the environment. However, these requirements mean ever-increasing financial and personal investments from young farmers. In addition, the acquisition of adapted physical and intellectual tools must receive greater support from the Union, as stated in the report, especially in the area of access to technological innovations. The CAP cannot afford to neglect those who will ensure that the Community has sustainable food sovereignty that respects man and the environment.

 I voted in favour of this text because I consider it to be essential for the European Union to equip itself with an Integrated Maritime Policy as quickly as possible. The EU would in fact have a great deal to gain from adopting a coherent strategy for implementing the different sectoral policies that have an impact on the maritime field, such as for example certain social, industrial or environmental policies, and also promoting the establishment of a real ‘mutually supporting system’. I also welcome the will to step up the fight against climate change and pollution through the emergence of real centres of innovation, which will also be a source of competitiveness and social welfare for the coastal regions of the Union. Finally, I support the report’s proposals regarding the security aspect of maritime policy, and in particular the idea of drawing up common rules in this area and sharing surveillance methods within the Community maritime space. This would enable us both to combat maritime piracy, a phenomenon that we have seen the return of in recent years, and to protect the natural heritage and archaeology of these areas in order to prevent any catastrophes that would have disastrous effects on the development of the Union’s coastline.

I warmly welcome Mr Lehtinen’s report, which puts consumer protection at the heart of efforts to complete the internal market. The report points out that a high level of protection for all consumers in the European Union can be achieved only through a horizontal approach – in other words with the help of sector-based directives aimed at harmonising national laws – and it also underscores the need to strengthen confidence among those same consumers. That depends particularly on ensuring the safety of all products in circulation and the security of all transactions both in the realm of cross-border trade in services and in electronic commerce. I am also pleased that the report proposes research into the implementation at European level of rapid and effective means of redress for consumers. The establishment of non-judicial systems of dispute resolution would be one means of meeting expectations in this regard, as would the adaptation of certain forms of redress such as collective action – which already exist in certain Member States – to the Community legal context. At the same time, I believe it would be useful to explore in greater depth, and in the light of different national experiences, the advantages and the limitations of such arrangements.

I welcome the adoption of this report, which, in my view, will enable us to improve significantly the relations between interest representatives and the EU institutions. Rather than trying to establish and keep up-to-date a comprehensive list of these representatives – a tedious and perhaps even impossible task – it proposes, in particular, establishing a global definition of the term ‘lobby’, which will ensure that any bodies that are not on the list cannot get around the rules we have laid down. Another major step forward is the harmonisation and simplification of the regulatory framework applicable to lobbyists, and in particular the creation of a single register that is common to all the institutions, which will list all lobbyists and will, in the long term, become a reference and a pledge of seriousness and credibility for all accredited organisations. However, this register will also promote greater transparency vis-à-vis the general public because it will be accessible online in its entirety and will include for each body its complete identification details, including details of its staff, as well as all of the pertinent financial information relating to it. In addition to this ‘one-stop shop’ a common code of ethical behaviour, Members of the European Parliament who draw up a report will have the opportunity to list in the report the names of the organisations that have helped them with their work.

As shadow rapporteur for the Socialist Group, I have devoted a great deal of time and energy to this subject with a view, as far as the substance is concerned, to explaining the need for more dialogue with civil society on the fight against drugs and, as far as the form is concerned, proposing a text that can be read and understood by everyone. With their first-hand experience and capacity for innovation, I think that the actors in civil society can really make a useful contribution to national and European policies on prevention and information as well as helping people out of their dependency and reintegrating them into society. So many actions are needed at different levels: at work, at school, on the streets and in prisons. I therefore welcome the adoption of this report, which salutes the creation of the Civil Society Forum on Drugs and underlines the importance of greater cooperation between civil society and all the institutions and agencies of the Union. The fight against drugs concerns all of us and those who are in the front line of the fight, who work every day to help drug addicts and prevent more people sinking into dependency, must be particularly important partners.

 Given the gravity of the situation in Tibet, the European Parliament could stay silent no longer. I therefore supported this resolution, which strongly condemns the brutal repression in this region by the Chinese security forces. The violence that has taken place in the streets of Lhasa and Dharamsala and the censorship of foreign media are intolerable and our institution must, together with the international community, use all of its influence to ensure that it stops and that China respects its international commitments in the field of human rights and minorities. Through my vote I also wished to express my solidarity with the people of Tibet, most of whom are not demanding independence but greater political autonomy and respect for their cultural and linguistic heritage. I am not in favour of a complete boycott of the Beijing Olympics because, in my view, dialogue is always preferable to closure. I believe, however, that these Games are an opportunity to encourage the Chinese authorities to make progress on the road to democracy, and I hope, as stated in the resolution, that the EU heads of state or government will adopt a consistent common position in relation to this event.

This report reflects substantial amendment work by the members of the PSE, Verts/ALE, GUE/NGL and ALDE Groups in the Committee on Civil Liberties, Justice and Home Affairs. From a text that initially stigmatised Islam and Muslims in a quite disgraceful way, the progressive, centre-left majority managed to craft a balanced document highlighting the whole range of factors (economic, social and so on) that favour support for terrorism, asserting the need to respect fundamental rights, and emphasising the importance of combating discrimination and promoting equality of opportunity, especially in education, training and employment. There are, however, two or three points in the report that I find dubious, notably the references to ‘moderate Islam’ and to ‘monitoring of all the locations where propaganda is being disseminated that aims at persuading people to commit terrorist acts’. Nonetheless, while I may be unable to give the report my wholehearted support, rejecting it would mean surrendering to the right and consigning months of effort to the waste bin. That is why the best course, in my view, is to abstain and to explain the reasons for doing so.

 Mr President, I would like to mention three matters that are particularly close to my heart. The first concerns the way we are going to deal with the phase leading up to the entry into force of the Treaty of Lisbon. Like all my colleagues on the Committee on Civil Liberties, Justice and Home Affairs, I would like us to reach an interinstitutional agreement on bringing forward the new provisions applicable to our area of competence. Indeed, this seems to me to be the sine qua non

 for an effective and transparent collaboration. The new rules on the role of the national parliaments should also be tried out this year. As rapporteur on the Framework Decision on combating terrorism, I made a commitment to cooperate in a close and structured manner with the national parliaments. On the subject of terrorism, an overview of the various texts already adopted would provide a better picture of their respective scope and how they relate to one another. Furthermore, whilst the fight against terrorism has to be a priority for the European Union, so must the protection of fundamental freedoms. I will therefore be extremely vigilant, when working on the framework decision, regarding the clarity of the definitions and terms used, to rule out any potential risk of infringing these freedoms, particularly freedom of expression. Finally, I would like to say a few words about our future action on immigration. The EU has for a long time been mainly concerned with equipping itself with a veritable arsenal of laws to fight illegal immigration, though this protective attitude towards its borders has not been counterbalanced by a policy on legal immigration worthy of the name. I am therefore delighted with the initiatives adopted over the last few years in this area, and I hope that the political will to support a welcoming Europe will be as strong as it was to defend fortress Europe.

Mr President, I welcome the fact that Parliament has taken the initiative of producing this report since, if the role of women in industry is utterly crucial, their professional situation overall remains much more precarious than that of men. Thus the report points to a considerable number of discriminatory situations involving women that must be tackled immediately, especially their confinement to certain sectors and certain types of jobs with low pay and limited career prospects, their over-representation among atypical employees, particularly those subjected to part-time employment, or the difficulties they encounter in rejoining the labour market after maternity leave. I feel that one of the courses of action mentioned to rectify this circumstance, the idea of a reward for companies encouraging reconciliation between professional life and family life, is quite interesting, and indeed the improvement of women’s career prospects ought to be encouraged by enhancing life-long learning. I must, however, voice certain regrets as to the format of the report. I feel that the text is too long and not properly structured, and this impairs its readability and effectiveness.

 European rosé wine producers are today worried by the Commission’s application project regarding lifting the ban on blending white and red table wine in order to make rosé wine. This new practice undermines quality production and ignores the hard work that producers have put in over many years to create a rosé product which, having been discredited for a long time, has now found its true place on the market and on the tables of countless consumers. This is all the more true given that this practice could mislead consumers. If the Commission’s plan for blending is confirmed by the Member States over the coming weeks, we, together with my colleague Mr Savary, hope that compulsory labelling will be introduced, enabling true rosé wine to be distinguished from a new product made by blending, which consequently could not be called rosé.

Mr President, I shall be brief. First of all, I should like to thank Mr Mitchell and to commend his work. I should also like to thank the Commissioner for his commitment and say that the food crisis will not simply be dealt with in two or three years but will remain a concern during the years to come. I should like to add one point in my role as representative of the Committee on Agriculture and Rural Development. It is that, for fifteen years, the proportion of development aid devoted to agriculture has been consistently falling. As Mr Diouf has said, it has dropped from 15 to 4%. It is time to consider the idea that development also means supporting agriculture and, if this facility is to have meaning in the future, then this is the meaning that I personally intend to give it.

Commissioner, Minister, Mr Capoulas Santos, I should like, then, to speak and, as Mr Goebbels said, two minutes on such an important report is not long. What I would like to say is quite simple. I would first like to defend the balance of the report proposed today by Mr Capoulas Santos. It was necessary to update the common agricultural policy, which is the aim of the health check, but, at the same time, it was equally necessary to retain the unity of this policy at European level while allowing it to continue to be a policy that sets agricultural objectives throughout Europe. It is this balance that I now intend to defend by taking four examples. The first example is that of milk quotas, which have provoked debate, and, I say this sincerely, in my view the position that was found is the right one. We need to remain cautious on this issue. All those who want to act quickly to increase the quantities produced and get rid of market-based mechanisms, run the significant risk of seeing the price of milk fall and letting themselves in for extremely cumbersome restructuring work. The decoupling of aid: here too, we have found a position that, in my view, is balanced. Total decoupling jeopardises many kinds of production. We must protect the different kinds of production in Europe: sheep, cattle, goat and small-scale vegetable production. With regard to regulation mechanisms, we can in fact go down the road of insurance, but we must also retain public mechanisms that enable prevention and regulation; this is what is in this report, and that, in my view, is very important. Finally, with regard to the overall development of aid and the manner in which we go about it, I should like to say that, in modulating and limiting Article 68, important steps have been taken; they are a move in the right direction towards a condition, to ensure that our global agricultural production model moves towards sustainability. We must bear in mind maintaining an operating model that is based on individuals or groups and that takes account of three objectives, namely economic, ecological and social objectives.

 Mr President, I should also like to welcome the measures proposed this evening, which will hopefully be carried in tomorrow’s vote. Action had to be taken on account of the fact that, in some countries, this crisis is affecting a great many farmers, not to mention the sector itself and all those working therein. I should also like to say a few words about the manner in which the measures are to be taken, specifically those concerning market management. In this regard, as has already been mentioned by my group just now, I hope, as regards cofinancing, we will be giving priority to 100% European funding. Furthermore, it strikes me that the time has come for Europe to reflect on the manner in which we apply the precautionary principle when it comes to all health problems, or any other problems that may affect our individual countries and the continent as a whole. I believe in fact that unless Europe applies the precautionary principle, there is a major risk that, due to a succession of problems, and the fact that not all States have all the information or deal with information in the most appropriate fashion, as has been the case in recent months, there will be crises affecting entire sectors, both industrial and agricultural. We then ask farming and the WTO, in this case the poultry sector, to come along and compensate for the impact that is not down to the structures or to the farming sector, but, rather, to panic, as has rightly been mentioned, with specific examples, this evening. I therefore believe that we need a Europe-wide policy to address crisis situations and ensure that measures are taken at European level and are applicable across the board. This particular crisis is an example that should set a precedent for the future. It should lead us to reflect on both agriculture, and, more importantly, on other sectors such as public health, with the aim of henceforth applying the precautionary principle at European level.

Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, I should like, first of all, to join with all the others who have just spoken in congratulating Mr Parish on the work he has done and to say to you that I am completely in agreement with the objectives set out in this report. Firstly, that of taking an overall view of the environmental question: bioenergy, biomass and biodegradable matter. Secondly, that of diversifying our sources of energy given that we know that we have to anticipate that fossil fuel will run out in 40 or 50 years’ time and that we must fight with all our might against the greenhouse effect. Thirdly, and this above all since it concerns agriculture, that of offering new market outlets for our European agriculture. Having said that, I would like to add that this can be done only on two conditions, Commissioner. Firstly, biofuels do not, on their own, constitute the whole of the agriculture policy and, in the context of this agriculture policy, we have to maintain two pillars: one linked to production and one linked to territorial and social cohesion. Secondly, the new policy aimed at bioenergy cannot specifically have any meaning unless it is fully part of a political process and willingness to make the agricultural model a model for sustainable development. I believe, therefore, that we have to commit ourselves to considering the new models that allow for diversification of agricultural production while at the same time guaranteeing a sound ecological balance for all of our territories.

 Madam President, as this debate is drawing to a close I would simply like to make a comment, mainly to the Commissioner, and draw a conclusion from it. My comment is that following the reform of the sugar WTO, we are finding, contrary to what is often said, that it is the least developed countries that are now asking us not to continue solely down the road of tariff cuts and preferential access to markets, but to try to define relations that will really allow them to develop. That is the major comment I wanted to make. It is rather paradoxical in that we can protect agriculture in particular, while at the same time enabling many of the least developed countries to develop. I conclude from this, Commissioner, that two important things must be kept in mind and given equal priority in the world talks and in the quest for a general balance that will avoid a return to bilateralism where the strongest wins. Firstly, negotiations on access and tariffs and secondly, protection and the idea that preferential agreements are just as useful for development today as purely commercial thinking. That is the message I wanted to pass on to you this afternoon.

 I am abstaining from voting on this report for the following reasons. - I am in favour of a stronger, more political Europe. It is difficult for the European Parliament to put forward a figure for the general budget that is below that proposed by the Commission. It is difficult to want more Europe without an adequate budget. I feel it necessary, therefore, to give some pointers to the Heads of State or Government who will make the final decision on the level of the financial perspective. They must give to Europe the means of achieving its goals - Joint financing of the first pillar of the common agricultural policy (CAP) must be rejected. It introduces ideas that could prove destructive to one of the founding policies of the European Union and moves it towards renationalisation. It does nothing at all for the European credit deficit. Instead it transfers responsibility for part of the cost onto the Member States and/or their territorial communities without ensuring that they actually have the means to pay. It is a false solution for those who refuse to take decisions in favour of a better distribution of public support for agriculture and for a more in-depth review of the CAP that would lead to more sustainable agriculture.

 Madam President, I would first like to congratulate Mr Fava for his excellent work that will allow the adoption of a directive setting out sanctions for the employers of illegal workers. However, I would like to draw your attention to the complexity of the current situation. We need to draw up legislation which is equal to this complexity. Throughout the European Union, those who place orders are resorting to a cascade of subcontracting, using subcontractors from the Member States without knowing whether or not the employees are working legally. An amendment was proposed that would check the legality of their employees’ situation. Why has it not been included? Also, it is stipulated that the main contractor is responsible for the payment of wages, but only if they know that the subcontractors are employing illegal immigrants. Well, you are not going to find anyone who places an order who will spontaneously admit their guilt. Finally, the best directive in the world can only be effective if it is accompanied by real checking mechanisms. We could improve these checks if we had more employment inspectors in each European country with wider roles. It is essential that we design a more rigorous legal arsenal as soon as possible so that those placing orders are declared wholly responsible in case of fault on the part of subcontractors. We should not close our eyes to known practices in certain economic sectors that are complicit in the activities of organised illegal immigration networks.

Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, first of all I should like to commend the remarkable work of my friend, Mr Cercas, the rapporteur of this text, which is now back on the table, at second reading, thanks to a surprising compromise by the June Council. Belgians, Cypriots, Hungarians and Spaniards rejected it, and they were right to do so, because it is aimed at greater flexibility, and this, at the expense of workers’ safety, which is unacceptable. Do you sincerely believe that, at a time of widespread lay-offs and a proliferation of redundancy plans throughout the European continent, employers need to be able to impose 65 hours a week, or more, on employees? A bit of consistency would be to the European Union’s credit. We are currently subsidising entire industrial sectors in order to avoid redundancies, and we are right to do so. However we should also protect workers in their jobs, when they are still in companies, or in their administrations. At a time when citizens have their doubts about Europe – and this was mentioned just now – the Council’s compromise, were Parliament to accept it, would send out the worst possible message. This directive must set a maximum weekly limit on working hours for health and safety reasons. It must not be a damaging directive in social and human terms. This is the position upheld by our rapporteur and the European Trade Union Confederation, and this is the position that I too am going to uphold alongside him.

Madam President, I should like to begin by commending the work of our colleague, Mr Andersson. What exactly does the European Union want, though? A single market abandoned to unbridled competition that quashes collective rights as a whole, or a regulated single market that enables the citizens to carry out decent work throughout Europe? The messages from the European Court of Justice, often those from the Commission, and at times those from the Council Presidency, are neither clear nor always consistent. A society is only worth, and only survives by, the contract with which it provides itself. Deregulation, the ‘every man for himself’ approach, leads to even more deregulation and, ultimately, to the explosion of the system. This is not what we want. Yes, indeed, we want an internal market, but a market that serves to improve the living and working conditions of our fellow citizens. The Treaty of Lisbon sets out a number of principles, including the right to negotiate collective agreements. Let us ensure that this principle is respected by the European Union and by all the Member States.

 Madam President, I would like to go back to the rather unorthodox statements made by Mr Barroso. He implies that he would be willing to forget the sacrosanct rules of competition; that he would be less particular about state aid. If it were a question of saving a particular sector of European industry, if it were a question of allowing Member States to invest in research or even of launching an ambitious European loan, I would welcome this U-turn. However, it is a question of the large-scale repurchasing of toxic financial products held by financial operators. It is a question, at the end of the day, of saving the financial hooligans who make light of the efforts of market regulators. If the Commission reviews its doctrine, then so much the better. However, this has to be done properly, by being more flexible about the question of state aid in strategic sectors in Europe that are under threat, and by driving forward measures concerning rating agencies, the fight against speculation based on food prices and the regulation of speculative funds. We have been calling for this for years, and now we have the proof: the credo of free competition and the free market have clearly led to a dead end.

 Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, once again in the last few days, in Saint-Nazaire in France, some workers – this time Greek – employed by a German subcontractor to another subcontractor in the shipbuilding industry, have gone unpaid. European Court of Justice jurisprudence has reaffirmed the employment rights of workers seconded within the EU, but how effective are these rights if Europe is not equipped with the necessary legislation to compensate for the failings of subcontractors? We are no longer talking about isolated cases. Throughout the European Union, order-givers are increasingly using tiers of subcontractors from other Member States, and cases of seconded workers not being paid are becoming more common. Three men, three Greek employees, finally obtained payment of their wages, but only after three weeks of hunger strike. We cannot make grandiloquent speeches about Europe and do nothing. It is essential that, as soon as possible, we come up with the necessary legal arsenal for order-givers to be held responsible for the failings of subcontractors.

 Mr President, in December the European Court of Justice handed down a long-awaited judgment that has very worrying implications for the protection of posted workers in Europe. It sends a negative signal to our citizens, who are concerned about the risks of social dumping. What does the Court say in this so-called ‘Laval’ ruling? It says that the Swedish trade unions were wrong to try to force a Latvian undertaking to sign their collective agreement, in particular with regard to the minimum wage. Under the 1996 Directive, however, posted workers have to observe a nucleus of mandatory rules for minimum protection in the host Member State. The Court rules that the Swedish system of collective bargaining was not applicable and that such rules could only be imposed by the law. The European message is thus no longer clear: on the one hand, the Commission prioritises flexicurity and the system of collective bargaining as a model; on the other hand, the Court of Justice discredits this model. Parliament and the Council must therefore clarify this issue. Otherwise, it would be like throwing the Bolkestein Directive out the front door only to allow it to sneak in the back, which would be entirely unacceptable.

 Mr President, we know that, at the last Transport Council, there was no agreement among the Member States as to how Galileo was to be funded; while highly symbolic, the project may also allow Europe to affirm its practical independence in the field of satellite communications, but lack of private-sector investment means that it cannot be completed for lack of EUR 2 400 million, and what that demonstrates is that public assistance is absolutely indispensable to major collective projects. Where, then, is this funding to be found? I suggest that we make use of the European financial commitments that have not been used by the Member States, in other words, the amount – between EUR 3 and 10 billion – returned every year to the various countries that have not completely used up Europe’s largesse. Use of this resource would be the most painless option for both Europe and the Member States and would enable the EU to fully play its part as an investor in the future.

Mr President, the total amount of aid that Europe has given to Darfur since 2004 comes to EUR 304 million, and that is positive. But what is stopping us from acting more effectively at political level; from seeing an end, at last, to the crimes against humanity that are committed in this region of the world? Two-hundred thousand deaths, two million displaced persons – what more do we need to make us really take action and stop making do with conclusions that merely list our concerns? How many more deaths must there be before we finally decide to turn our statements into acts? The prosecutor of the International Criminal Court has presented substantial evidence against individuals accused of war crimes and crimes against humanity, one of whom is a minister of the Sudanese Government. We have been able to deploy a whole range of sanctions against the Moldavian separatists, the agitators in Congo, Liberia and the Ivory Coast, and the Belorussian leaders. Let us impose these same sanctions – visa ban, freezing of assets – on all persons implicated in the reports by the United Nations commission of inquiry and group of experts. Let us stop making conscience-easing statements, and let us finally act more practically, more politically, without worrying about geopolitical presuppositions.

Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, the rise of the extreme right in Europe is an issue of major concern and the creation of a such a group in this Parliament casts a dark shadow over our history, just over sixty years after the liberation of the concentration camps. Europe was created on the basis of recognising the errors of the past, with a view to banishing them forever. But today we have certain Members of this Parliament who are forgetting about that, and in some cases even worse, denying it, and hence putting us at risk of having to live through those situations again. That is unacceptable and the political health cordon intended to prevent democracy from becoming infected, however essential it may be, is not enough. The fundamental cause of this trouble is political and philosophical, but also economic and social. Lack of well-being leads to malaise, which can in turn lead to fear and suspicion of others and their differences. Let us therefore commit ourselves to showing more solidarity, to caring more for those excluded and forgotten in our current society, so that those who profit from the misfortune and misery of others are not allowed to tarnish our hard-won European democracy.

Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, some members of the World Trade Organization do not comply with fundamental social standards and use the violation of social rights to compete unfairly and to distort the rules of competition. Besides the European Communication on promoting decent work for all, how is the Union using its influence in the WTO to ensure respect for the fundamental rights of workers in member countries? There are 200 million children in paid employment in the world, 12 million people perform forced labour, more than two million employees die every year from the consequences of accidents at work or of occupational diseases, and 145 trade unionists were assassinated last year. In the light of these facts, it is not surprising that globalisation frightens our fellow citizens. Declaring good intentions is laudable, but it is not enough. The time has come to penalise all countries that benefit from the opening of markets but refuse to comply with the International Labour Conventions. Europe must organise itself and use its collective influence in the WTO to ensure that the requirements of the International Labour Organization are respected.

Mr President, for some time now, the influx of migrants has been portrayed as a seemingly unacceptable threat. This rhetoric has been taken up by the far right, which is perpetuating the confusion between crime and immigration and which is thriving in this area. The fact is that these migrants are first and foremost victims: victims of the Mafia-like networks that become rich by bringing over men and women who want to build a future for themselves; and victims of European businessmen and slum landlords who prosper by enslaving a cheap workforce, in the former case, and by renting out insalubrious accommodation at exorbitant prices, in the latter case. Faced with that, let us put all of the existing Community instruments into operation so that we can combat these sectors. Let us review the regulation that stipulates that asylum applications must be reviewed by the first Member State in which asylum seekers step foot, because that puts an unacceptable burden on countries in Southern and Eastern Europe. Furthermore, the overcrowded and inhuman transit camps are no longer acceptable. Finally, let us have the objectivity and courage to say that Europe will need legal immigrants in order to compensate for its demographic deficit. Let us therefore move out of our political comfort zone, let us stop making facile ideological statements and let us clearly state that immigration can also represent an opportunity for Europe.

Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, voting in favour of this financial perspective would mean going back on one’s decision and not providing Europe with the resources for its ambitions. In June 2005, virtually the whole of Parliament voted in favour of a budget of EUR 974 billion. This, in order to make a success of enlargement and of a policy of active growth and of support for research, thereby preparing for the future. Today, the same people are preparing to vote in favour of the financial perspective, which has been slashed by EUR 110 billion. Would you believe it? I challenge anyone to understand that. To vote in favour of that would be tantamount to believing that a two-speed form of enlargement exists: that of the past, which, in the South, enabled Greece, Portugal and Spain fully to develop; and that of the present, which, in the East, inspires a debate that is all the more grandiloquent because it conceals the fact that there is insufficient financing. On every side of this House, I will make a bet with you that, month after month, year after year, report after report, we will have to suffer the long litany of regrets at having an insufficient budget, but it will be too late. It is now that the European Parliament must confirm that it is the driving force behind European life. To quote the words of the Bolivian President, Mr Evo Morales Ayma, who visited us here the day before yesterday: ‘let us not lie, let us not be weak, let us be strong, let us not accept a financial perspective that is a cut-price financial perspective'.

Madam President, although, as draftsman of the opinion of the Committee on Budgets, I generally support the approach taken by the Commission, I should like to emphasise the political dimension of this matter and to point out, if I may, two shortcomings. For two years now, the European Commission has been seeking to develop standardisation in the context of health, social, societal and environmental services. It proposes to make wider use of standardisation work in the field of services, while preserving the monopolistic nature of the bodies mentioned in the report – which is, in my opinion, regrettable – even though standardisation has been mainly focused up to now on industrial products and nothing else. Standards, when viewed in the specific context of services, tend to be substituted for the harmonisation of European legislation, which is worrying. However necessary, indeed essential, standardisation may be, it cannot take precedence over legislation. These standards are required in all European invitations to tender but, until now, they have been drawn up exclusively by manufacturers, without any democratic control, and may accordingly constitute an obstacle to market access, which is something that we cannot accept. That is why it is important to ensure, in particular, that all of the parties involved can actually participate in the work of these bodies. That obviously includes manufacturers, but it also includes consumer associations, clients, local authority representatives or even environmental protection associations. The compromise amendments certainly address this concern, but only to a very small extent. On the other hand, I felt that, insofar as public funds were involved, the European Parliament had to be informed each year of the standardisation process that had actually been implemented. European standards organisations are actually associations of general interest in receipt of public aid from the Community. As such, they must obviously meet obligations with regard to transparency. The compromise amendment regarding this issue makes provision for a Commission assessment of standardisation activities to be carried out at least once every five years, which is clearly not often enough. So there you have my observations summed up in a few words, Madam President. I should like wholeheartedly to congratulate the rapporteur and the coordinators on the quality of the work done, but I deplore the insufficient efforts made to encourage greater plurality and regret that the assessments of standardisation activities should be so infrequent.

Mr President, our democracies are based on non-negotiable principles: peace and freedom, mutual respect, equality and, if possible, fraternity. It was the tragedies of history, and particularly of the Second World War, that finally made our respectful elders acknowledge the need firmly to establish peace on our continent. The act of remembrance still makes for a healthier world, and to refuse to accept the lessons that history has taught us by denying its events means running the risk of being condemned to relive those events. For the sake of that, we, as Europeans, cannot tolerate the repeated remarks made by the President of Iran denying the Holocaust, laying claim to a myth and calling for the disappearance of Israel. It would be disgraceful on our part if we were to trivialise those remarks and to ignore them in the name of goodness knows what intolerable realpolitik
 or real economy. Everyone, including the people of Iran and ourselves, must shoulder their responsibilities and insist that Mr Ahmadinejad retracts his unspeakable statements. We cannot let a country that endorses those kinds of remarks by its President take part in an international sporting event on European soil. Equally, we could not tolerate its presence in Nuremberg, as that would be an insult to the memory of the Holocaust martyrs.

Mr President, the UK Presidency has presented its proposals broken down into figures for the financial perspective 2007-2013. We feared the worst. We were not wrong. Following nine months of work by the temporary committee on the financial perspective, the European Parliament had reached a satisfactory compromise, enabling Europe to be guaranteed an ambitious and coherent future. In contrast, Mr Blair is proposing drastic cuts and jeopardising the European Union project. He is attacking the Structural Funds, rural development, youth and culture, and is making the funding of the Globalisation Adjustment Fund downright precarious. We must reach a mature position, for the sake of European integration. Let us put a stop to national self-interest and to the anachronistic benefits enjoyed by certain Member States. The United Kingdom must re-evaluate its contribution to the budget by doing more than just implementing a cosmetic measure. Europe is a joint project, not a trading floor. Let us also use the borrowing options available to us to provide ourselves with the resources to succeed. The European project and the solidarity we require with our new partners depend on our doing so.

Mr President, recently, the President of the French Republic was attributing to Europe responsibilities which, legally speaking, it does not have, given that the matter in hand related to redundancies on French soil. We have firmly condemned a form of political irresponsibility. More recently, the Director-General for Economic and Financial Affairs at the Commission, Mr Klaus Regling, was claiming that the European Union should set itself the objective of reducing wages by 3.7% in order to gain 1% in growth. That statement, which is just as grotesque as the first example, must be condemned just as vigorously. The Commission would be better off making innovative proposals in order to boost consumption. Instead, it is choosing to go beyond its role of making proposals by truly entering into the realms of provocation. The code of ethics of European responsibility requires the Heads of State or Government to be clear about who does what, but it also requires the European Commission – and this is, indeed, the most basic requirement – to take its work seriously.

 Mr President, in the west of France, in Guérande and Saumur, as well as in Spain, in Barcelona, nearly 800 job cuts are expected as a result of internal relocation within Europe. Celestica, a Canadian company manufacturing electronic cards, has taken the decision to close its production sites and relocate them in the Czech Republic, a country with lower labour costs and a Member of our Union. Europe’s decision to devote a little more than EUR 11 billion to the regions and people hit by restructuring is a good decision. In a context that is also marked by relocation, however, it is absolutely vital to have a policy in support of the employees and the regions that have to sustain relocation within the Union’s borders. Hopes for a European social model in aid of the 25 countries of the Union that is based on strong social cohesion can only exist if our Institutions implement real and significant policies of territorial and human solidarity. That is why it is today essential to capitalise on this strong political desire by supporting the men and women undergoing intra-European relocation.

 Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I want to take this opportunity to underline the importance of the European social model, which is under threat from the Working Hours Directive or the Directive on Services, while the problems of poverty, social exclusion and quality of life are even more acute today in a Europe of 25. A European Union of 25 Member States obviously shows greater economic and social disparities than when there were only 15. That is why it is even more important now than it was then to promote real social cohesion on our continent. To defend a European social model that would bear witness to a Europe of excellence is not to defend the status quo
. On the contrary, we must take advantage of enlargement to reaffirm social and employment policies that can characterise the European Union and also serve as an example to other regions of the world. What would greater competitiveness mean without a just social policy? What would greater growth mean if it did not benefit the largest number? The answer is obvious: everyone knows that policies that encourage social cohesion are determining factors in economic dynamism. On the forthcoming 22 and 23 March, the Heads of Government will be taking a crucial decision for the future of Europe when they adopt a strategy that will set the economic development agenda for five years. They cannot be unaware that a winning economic perspective must include high social standards, because these are also essential to a Europe of nations.
