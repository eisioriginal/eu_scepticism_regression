We have tried to seek a compromise. I believe there are two ways of carrying out politics. The inflexible way, which makes dialogue difficult, and the flexible way, which involves giving ground and trying to be constructive, a positive politics. We propose accepting a combination of passive and active measures (which in any event could have been included in another directive!) in the event that we replace the European Experimental Vehicles Committee (EEVC) tests, provided that these passive measures do not constitute more than 25% of all the measures. The alternative measures to the effective EEVC tests (which have proven to be effective for more than 20 years) should not therefore differ from the latter by more than 25%. We concede that the EEVC tests can be subject to a further viability study (like the alternative measures which the industry may present). The condition is that this study must be entirely independent. Finally, we wanted to clarify that the alternative measures must, in all cases, maintain the same level of protection as the EEVC tests, so that they protect all the parts of the body included on those tests. I believe that my group has made a great effort to make these concessions and I hope that you will accept them and that they will improve the protection of pedestrians.

Mr President, please allow me to thank you on behalf of all Andalusian fishermen, and on my own behalf, for the efforts you are making to persuade the Portuguese authorities to free Agustín García, the fisherman who, as you know, has spent more than two months in prison. Mr President, the Guadiana fishing agreement between Spain and Portugal expires today, and it would be really positive if the negotiations on the renewal of this agreement were to begin with a gesture of friendship and goodwill on the part of Portugal, freeing the imprisoned fisherman, as well as a commitment on the part of all fishermen to respect all the agreements signed. I would like to thank you once again and I would ask you not to forget this issue and to communicate this proposal to the relevant authorities.

Mr President, I should like to thank members of the Committee on Agriculture and Rural Development for supporting my report on rice by such a large majority. I would like to thank them too for the amendments tabled concerning the report. These also enjoyed a broad degree of consensus within the committee. Commissioner, the least protected open markets are also the most vulnerable. Areas that have long been cultivated and are a haven for biodiversity are now at risk. They are threatened by climate change, prolonged drought, and by the considerable pressure exerted on wetlands and protected areas by developers and indeed administrations. It happens that the largest and most important areas of bird life habitat in Europe are located in such traditional rice-growing areas. It is our responsibility to conserve this habitat regardless of the cost. The Commission has put forward a proposal for reform of the common organisation of the market in rice as part of the mid-term review of the common agricultural policy. The proposal takes account of the imbalance caused by the significant increase in imports and in domestic production. Together with the restrictions concerning export refunds, this has resulted in substantial surpluses. The situation is set to be exacerbated in 2006, as tariffs are to be significantly reduced following implementation of the Everything But Arms programme. The Commission does itself recognise that it is impossible to estimate the full impact of this initiative. Nonetheless it does maintain that intervention stocks will be unsustainable because of third-country exports. The whole philosophy of the COM reform proposed by the Commission is based on doing away with intervention. No consideration is given to the special significance of this crop in Europe. Account must be taken, moreover, of the fact that small regional economies dependent on crops such as rice are more threatened than ever in a globalised and liberalised world. The COM in rice must be reformed to adjust it to the new spirit of competitiveness prevailing in the markets. Nonetheless, producers must be assured of a reasonable income. Reform should also be compatible with fair trade and promote the interests of less developed countries. Further, the European Union must continue to play an important role with regard to landscape, as well as social and environmental conditions. None of this appears in the Commission’s proposal. It does not feature in relation to management of the market, specific rice payments or decoupled aid. If there is no intervention, if there is no protection at the frontiers, if the quality and safety we demand for our products is not guaranteed, this sector will cease to exist. Effectively, through this proposal, the Commission is passing the burden of responsibility for finding solutions to famine in the third world on to rice producers. This is unfair. A crop such as rice requires special agro-climatic conditions and is therefore bound to be concentrated in specific areas. If single-crop agriculture ceases in these areas, drought, neglect, or salinisation will inevitably ensue. In its report, the Committee on Agriculture and Rural Development endorsed the Commission’s decision to reduce the intervention price for rice so as to bring it into line with world prices. On the other hand, the committee rejected the proposal to set up a private storage regime whenever the price of rice falls below the effective support price. Consequently, a new concept has emerged, that of the effective support price, which is used to calculate tariffs on the basis of the maximum price system. This is then transferred to the market management system. This price does not amount to any kind of support for the producer and therefore differs, for example, from the intervention price. Rather, it is a virtual system used to trigger a further imprecise and poorly defined measure. I refer to private storage. The latter will not work. It has not worked for other sectors, and will only aggravate the producer’s financial situation. This will in any case be precarious, as the producer will have to bear the consequences of more capital being tied up and also the high costs of maintaining and preserving the product. I would now like to comment on the special EUR 120 price, that is, the proposed safety net. Allowing prices to stabilise at around EUR 120 amounts to allowing rice growers to go to the wall. Public intervention must therefore be retained as a regulatory mechanism with an institutional price guaranteeing competitiveness and self-sufficiency. Regarding protection at the frontiers, the exchange regime was designed to comply with the unfortunate Marrakech Agreements for this sector. Consequently, it provides for a system of maximum import prices. The price of husked cargo rice would therefore not be above 180 or 188% of the intervention price, depending on whether the rice is Indian or Japonica. This price does not take account of the costs of processing from unhusked to cargo. Further, it results in better quality, more expensive rice being imported into the Community at lower tariffs. The Commission has called for a mandate from the 15 Member States to allow it to negotiate replacement of the current system of variable import duties with fixed duties, within the World Trade Organisation. There does not appear to be agreement, however. The Committee on Agriculture believes it would be wise to do away with the maximum price system that has resulted in the current situation. It follows that a number of amendments to the report refer to the need to set up appropriate control mechanisms to avoid any irregularities. Other amendments concern the need to guarantee the origin of imported rice and to avoid social and environmental dumping. Still others concern preventing social phenomena such as triangulation, and call for strict traceability and labelling procedures to guarantee food safety. For all these reasons, the Committee on Agriculture feels a report assessing the consequences of tariff reductions further to the Everything But Arms 
initiative should be prepared as a mater of urgency. Such a report must also take account of our concerns and of the economies of third countries. Mr President, I have reservations as to whether decoupled payments as proposed by the Commission are appropriate for the specific environmental characteristics of rice growing. I am also concerned that cessation of cultivation might be detrimental to the environment in these areas. In addition, a proportional penalty system is required, not a progressive one. This is because rice producers are already unfairly penalised in comparison to other producers. Further, the reference areas must be those predating the reform proposal. I agree with Mr Cunha’s decision in that rice should be a special case, and that it should not be affected by decoupling.

 Mr President, I would like to point out that the Andalusian fisherman Agustín García has been held in prison in Faro by the Portuguese authorities since 8 May last. I would like to point out that the means used to arrest him were entirely disproportionate and that he was subjected to excessive violence and poor treatment. A simple offence was handled as if it were a terrorist act. It should be noted that he has been held in preventive detention since then, among dangerous criminals. Furthermore, he is unwell and has not received adequate medical treatment. The imprisonment of Mr García has already led to a general strike by the Andalusian fishing community and I believe that Portugal is trying to make an example of Mr García, making a simple fisherman, who has only committed this one offence, carry the can for a lack of political will. Mr President, I would ask you to intervene in order to solve this problem. Perhaps you might be able to contribute to resolving this lamentable situation.

 Mr President, Mr Yiannitsis, President-in-Office of the Council, I wonder if you have noticed where the honourable Members putting questions to you are seated? I am aware of the conclusions arrived at by the United Nations Legal Service on this matter, of course. Nonetheless, has the Council considered measures to control the actions of European multinationals, especially oil companies, to ensure the natural resources of Western Sahara are not exploited whilst the self-determination process takes place? What guarantees can we give the people of Western Sahara, through the Council, that we will not allow their natural resources to be exploited by European Union multinationals during the self-determination process?

Mr President, the proposal presented by our group last week that we should debate humanitarian aid to Iraq was rejected with arguments such as ‘it is hasty’, ‘we have not thought about it’, or ‘perhaps when the war is over’. Mr President, I frankly believe that this is not a serious approach. Our group believes that this debate should begin as soon as possible. Mr President, I remember that very recently this Parliament approved a joint resolution stating that this crisis was unprecedented and required urgent action. And it is not just necessary from a humanitarian and solidarity point of view, but also from a political point of view, because we must also re-establish the European Union’s unity of action in the face of this conflict, this crisis and this war. And the best way to do this would be to talk and to reach an agreement on humanitarian aid.

Let us continue with rice. EBA: Everything but Arms. If the 40 poorest countries are so poor and are dying of hunger, why do they have to send us rice? Let them eat it and then they will not be hungry! But my question is this: how can the Commissioner and the European Commission prevent Vietnam, for example, which falls within the Everything but Arms countries, from introducing its rice via its borders with Thailand and then Thailand from introducing it into the European Union? How can we guarantee that? How can it be controlled? Will we put a label on every grain of rice? How can we prevent the 40 poorest countries in the world, by means of multinationals we all know, which import rice, some of them here, from introducing these products via the poorest countries and wrecking our markets?

Mr President, I would firstly like to thank and congratulate the rapporteur, Mr Izquierdo, on his excellent work. Secondly, I would like to apologise to the Commissioner, because this is the first time in this legislature that this Member will refer expressly to his region, Andalusia. Andalusia – as you know – is one of the most extensive territories of the European Union, with almost 8 million inhabitants and in 2002 it received 21 million visitors who generated EUR 13 200 million. As you know, it is one of the Union’s Objective 1 regions, with one of the lowest levels of income, but it survives thanks to agriculture and tourism. The report itself talks of the substantial impact of transport on European tourism and the need to create north-south corridors in order to facilitate the free trade area between Europe and the Mediterranean, as well as the development of the outermost regions. Well, what do you make, ladies and gentlemen, of the fact that Algeciras, which is the European Union’s largest Mediterranean container port, has just one connection, by rail, with the interior, which follows a route which is more than a century old and which allows an average of no greater than 17 km/h? Did you know that the only Mediterranean coastal area in the whole of the European Union which does not have a motorway is between the provinces of Malaga and Almeria? Well, between them is located the province of Granada, which has the lowest income in Spain and in Europe. If infrastructures do not get there, how are we going to develop? These are examples of the infrastructure deficit of the peripheral regions of the Union. While the different Community policies allow these bottlenecks, there is little or nothing we can do to create cohesive transport and intermodality from social and environmental points of view. I am glad that this report has not forgotten users of two-wheeled vehicles, who are extremely important in terms of individual transport and its sustainability in cities, which, thanks to them, are more human places to be. We must continue to work to increase safety standards in transport and its infrastructures, pinpointing black spots and protecting them. Ladies and gentlemen, if only for money, let us work, let us invest more in safety. One death costs us EUR 1 million and we have 40 000 deaths a year on the roads. The report does not mention non-transport. We must work on an innovative aspect, which is the pedestrianisation of the cities.

 Mr President, Commissioner, two contrasting worlds coexist on our planet. In one of these worlds, hunger, AIDS and poverty are rampant. In the other, the world we live in, people die from high cholesterol. On the one hand, there is the developed world, bent on identifying axes of evil and launching wars which can only result in further devastation and poverty. On the other, we see a world crying out for someone to assume the leadership of an axis of good which would make food and medicine freely available and eliminate the barriers to free trade whilst promoting sustainable internal development to ensure self-sufficiency. Export refunds for surplus production destined to the poorest countries is the cruellest of all our policies. It runs counter to solidarity and should only be applied in the case of over-protected and more developed markets. Hypocrisy cannot be condoned though. We must not cast all responsibility on to the weakest sector in Europe, namely the traditional European agricultural sector, which has the lowest income in the Community. It is not for this sector to provide solutions to the problem of world hunger.

 Mr President, Commissioner, the Prestige
 disaster is a timely reminder that aquaculture is no different from any other potentially polluting industrial activity, and can itself be seriously affected. This has been the case for the Galician fish farms. Aquaculture has a promising future. It will make it possible to maintain the supply of high quality products to the markets. It will also allow depleted fishing grounds to be restocked. This is a new option. Additional support is required for research and the development of new products free from genetic modification. Direct cooperation with local and regional authorities must also be strengthened in order to promote aquaculture. This is particularly necessary in those areas worst affected by drastic restructuring resulting from failure to sign fishing agreements, or following the reform of the common fisheries policy. Lastly, I urge the Commission not to overlook traditional activities such as aquaculture in estuaries and their impact on the natural environment, much of which is protected.

I would like to make a brief comment to the President-in-Office of the Council, whom I wish all the luck in the world. We need the Council to act more quickly. As a result of 1 January and the Prestige
 disaster, the Spanish State has applied certain more restrictive rules for single-hull ships. This has led to queues of single-hull ships entering Gibraltar in order to evade inspections. The United Kingdom must not remain on the sidelines, and there must be no free ports, which to some extent are pirate ports, which receive ships in a manner which is contrary to the actions of the European Union. For this reason, I would ask you to act more quickly and I would ask that nobody in the European Union should remain on the sidelines when these rules are so very necessary.

Mr President, I would like to point out that the dialogue between the governments of the different Member States must be the main tool for resolving problems, especially in the case of neighbouring States. I am referring here specifically to the attitude of the Portuguese Government to the Andalusian fishermen. Simple violations, such as entering Portuguese waters, have recently, on two occasions, been responded to with machine-guns which, thanks to Providence, have not injured anybody. I would appeal for sanity and responsibility in order to find a solution to a problem we have had for decades.

Mr President, Commissioner, the main effect of sport on those who participate in it is the promotion of physical and mental health, as well as education in tolerance, respect for rules and acceptance of a result by everybody. These rules are profoundly democratic and promote dialogue and companionship. In this world where single, absolute and reductionist thinking is dominant, the promotion of the values of sport is the key antidote to intolerance and xenophobia and favours social integration. Educating through sport means ensuring democratic values for future generations and this must appear in the Treaties.

 Mr President, one very quick question: I have just read in a Spanish newspaper that Nestlé, a large multinational, is demanding USD 6 million from Ethiopia in the middle of a famine.

Whatever the case, the situation is none the less cruel.

Mr President, thanks to the improvement in communication networks, particularly within cities, in population centres, pedestrianisation and the increase in the volume of four-wheeled traffic, the number of users of two-wheeled vehicles is increasing every day, as you have said. I would like to ask you, Commissioner, whether you are intending to implement any type of specific initiative to promote the use of two-wheeled vehicles, bearing in mind, furthermore, the current situation with regard to the cost of insurance, which is leading to a significant reduction in the numbers of these vehicles sold.

Mr President, forgive me for insisting: in this House we have discussed every imaginable subject but we have still not held a specific debate on the issue of world hunger. If we do not do anything now, a million people are condemned to die in a few months, but if we continue to do what the international community has done up until now, these famines will reoccur cyclically. We cannot continue to send agricultural surpluses which are constantly destroying the fragile agricultural economies of these countries. We have carried out ‘everything but arms’; this is laudable, but entirely insufficient. We therefore need a specific, in-depth debate, which will lead to forward-thinking decisions in accordance with our current needs. (Applause)

Mr President, this is not a procedural issue. At this very moment an oil tanker is moored in the port of Gibraltar, the ‘Moskowsky Festival’, which the Spanish Government, specifically the Spanish navy, expelled last Saturday, sending it more than 400 miles from Galicia. This is an oil tanker which is not good for Galicia, which is not good for Community seas and which should not be moored in a free port nor in waters which both Spain and Gibraltar consider to be their own. (Applause)

 Mr President, once again terrible images of another famine in the Horn of Africa are gradually starting to reach us through the media. We shall once again see ourselves swamped by these images of hundreds of children dying of hunger, without organising a specific debate on hunger in the world. We are also seeing similar images from Argentina, and we will do too little, too late, like last time. I would therefore ask you, Mr President, to ensure that we do not do what we did at the time of the FAO Summit in Rome, which we allowed to go by without a specific debate on hunger. We must organise a debate and adopt a practical resolution, instead of simply allowing history to repeat itself.

Mr President, Mr President of the Commission, the Brussels Council has once again shown a politically negative face: two Member States decide for the rest, without taking account of everybody else’s contribution to the common project. This is pitiful, under any circumstances. On the other hand, we have seen a necessary and expected decision: enlargement to the East. As you have said, Mr Prodi, enlargement is the solution and not the problem. But it may give us many headaches if we do not establish adequate levels of funding, since many citizens like myself do not believe that it can be done when we are twenty-five countries with the money we have for fifteen. Particularly in terms of agriculture. Growth, yes, but guaranteeing the basic pillars, real cohesion, real convergence. Ambition, yes, but we must also accept that we need a greater budgetary contribution which reflects, in all respects, the challenge of this enormous political project, since to extract as much as possible from the present budget will not be sufficient.

 Mr President, Madam Vice-President, Article 159 of the Treaty states that the European Union will take account of the objective of economic and social cohesion when drawing up its policies. The second report on cohesion has shown that aid currently provided by the common agricultural policy favours producers in the more developed agricultural areas rather than those in the less developed ones. It would therefore be a mistake not to alter a system of aid which values production above other economic, social, environmental and land-related issues. Ladies and gentlemen, the latest proposals presented by the Commission contained in the mid-term review and the reform of the common agricultural policy could exacerbate still further the differences between the more and less developed rural areas. All the necessary impact studies must therefore be carried out before these reforms are implemented. At present, rural areas account for 80% of the European Union, and this percentage will increase following enlargement. The negative effects of the common agricultural policy, which has not fulfilled initial expectations, will therefore be even greater. We cannot do away with the functional model which has to underpin our agricultural policy. Nonetheless, we need to define new aid for small farmers, and policies to redistribute resources more equitably. Environmental conditions have to be mainstreamed. We should link agricultural and environmental polices and coordinate them. We must ensure our policies do provide for cohesion. Otherwise they could have a devastating effect in rural areas and cause a huge exodus from the countryside. There should be specific support for young farmers to establish themselves, and support also for small farmers who guarantee rural sustainability. Parliament’s Committee on Agriculture has concluded that enlargement will increase regional disparities and that targeted measures and an increase in structural funds will be needed to counter this. Enlargement and its negative effect on statistics will exclude a large number of regions which currently meet the criteria for Objective 1. For this reason we need to set a transitional period for these regions. We also need to devise a new classification system that takes account of the specific disadvantages of each region. I have in mind depopulation or the relief of the land. Enlargement does not just pose a challenge for Objective 1 rural areas. We must also remember that a kind of hidden enlargement is taking place as a result of Association Agreements with third countries to the south. Above all, there is one principle that we should re-define, namely Community preference in the general context of cohesion.

Mr President, Commissioner, there have recently been certain statements advocating the elimination of the Cohesion Fund. The removal of this Fund would penalise the countries which have managed to comply with the requirements for joining the euro and would simply be intolerable. Allow me to ask a few questions: why is there a desire to eliminate these cohesion funds in the future? Why is there a desire to simplify the procedures for the Structural Funds? What is the Commission’s view of the future of the Cohesion Fund for the candidate countries and for the citizens of the Member States?

 Mr President, Commissioner, Mr Stevenson, the European Commission rejected the proposal by the Spanish Presidency of the Council to adopt actions to promote protein crops of which there is a shortfall in the European Union, and which are being replaced with soya imports, mainly from the United States and often genetically modified. The Commission argues that amending the current policy could lead to legal proceedings being instituted against us in the WTO, something that should not concern us, given the protectionist attitude of the Bush administration. Commissioner, there is no doubt that our animal-feed industry and, ultimately, our livestock production and our food depend, to a large extent, on just one product: soya, the production and trading of which are under the control of the United States. How can the European Union allow this enormous strategic dependence to continue? Maintaining or increasing imports of these products which are not surplus to requirements, such as non-genetically modified soya and corn from developing countries, must be an important part of our cooperation policy but, at the same time, it must also be a priority to promote self-sufficient and sustainable agri-breeding systems within the least-favoured regions of the European Union, which create employment and sustain the rural population, primary genetic resources and the necessary production of biofuels.

Mr President, it is not a point of order, it is a reminder. A year ago today a food crisis was unleashed as a result of the presence of alphabenzopyrenes in olive pomace oil. The problem of the olive pomace industry has still not been resolved. The responsibility we had at that time in terms of food safety was very great, but this Parliament also has the responsibility to find solutions for an economic sector which furthermore carries out an essential and necessary environmental role by recycling highly polluting products.

Mr President, President of the Commission, Commissioner, Mr Aznar, I ask you not to relax. Your time of glory in the Presidency may have come to an end in the European Union, but your responsibility has not. The media screen of achievements that you have put up does not hide the very serious questions appearing on the horizon. The proposals from your party colleague, Mr Fischler, to reform the common fisheries policy or the CAP are generating uncertainty and concern among our fishermen and farmers. They just need to come into line with our reality, which today is very far from the virtual technocratic reality in the Commission. Now is the time for you to demonstrate the forcefulness of your politics there, here, where our future is being decided. Your greatest achievement in the Spanish Presidency has been your will, your team’s capacity for work. Congratulations! I had never seen so many memorandums presented here, although proportionally the progress has been scarce. You cut the tape for the launch of the euro. Very good. But you underestimated the prior work that had been done by some people. To conclude, your initial proposals on immigration were significantly reduced, thank God, and, to the disappointment of many, the people of Barcelona and Seville behaved and dispelled all of your alarmist predictions with their civic-minded attitude. I therefore formally ask, Mr President, that the European institutions congratulate both cities on their behaviour and civic-mindedness, and on their patience in the face of those expensive and unnecessary displays of power.

 Commissioner, with all due respect, the phrase I used, "pescaíto frito", is a colloquial phrase that we use in Andalusia to describe fresh fish that is caught and eaten daily, fried in top-quality oil, as you know. The truth is that the combination of the failed negotiations with Morocco and the CFP proposals with a view to sustainability, which also concerns us, is going to mean that small-scale fishing will almost entirely disappear. My question, Commissioner, would be, given this concern for sustainability, would you accept my invitation and that of my Group to visit Andalusian fishing ports, to come fishing with us for a couple of days, to see the problems of sustainability, the social and economic problems and the alternatives? I think this is very important if your position is to be credible and it would be fundamental with regard to the citizens and all the criteria that we, who defend fishing, also want to incorporate. We are worried about the fishing-grounds – we know they are depleted – but, as you are well aware, we are leaving the sea in the hands of industrial fleets, who are the ones that do not respect biological rest periods, and whose nets we cannot monitor, as we do with small-scale fishermen. I respectfully repeat our invitation, Mr Fischler.

Mr President, Commissioner, I would first like to thank the rapporteur for the work that she has done, despite all the pressure that we have all been under. There is a common denominator: we all agree that the number of accidents, injuries and deaths on European roads is absolutely unacceptable; and we also agree that we need to find viable methods of considerably reducing this number of victims. This report talks mainly about the most vulnerable road users; I would therefore have liked motorcyclists to have been explicitly mentioned as well as pedestrians and cyclists, since they are just as vulnerable. Vehicles need to be designed and built to be safer both for their occupants and for those around them, such as pedestrians. The problem is finding a legal, quick, effective and transparent way of doing it. Front designs that are capable of absorbing the impact of a pedestrian who is hit are vital in quantifying how much harm accidents would cause if they happened. We should not, however, forget that we need to take care of other aspects, such as promoting safer driving, maximum dissemination of road safety information and, essentially, as has rightly been said, designing and building road infrastructures that are safer for all users. The black spots on European roads are also black spots for this group of most vulnerable users. Metal barriers, inappropriate vertical signs and kerbs are among the causes behind an enormous number of victims. From the start of the debate our Group has rejected the so-called “voluntary agreements” with the automobile industry proposed by the Commission in order to improve the protection of the most vulnerable groups, as it is a system that could leave the way open for other extra-legislative agreements associated with transport and the environment, which concerns us given the lack of an interinstitutional agreement in that respect. This would not happen with a legislative process, because, although it would take longer, it would maintain stricter parliamentary control. It is true, ladies and gentlemen, that a voluntary agreement with industry would enable us to start sooner. But it is also true that, according to all the data, it would save fewer lives. We have tabled a series of amendments rejecting this voluntary agreement. Amendment No 4 refers to the need for consumer and user organisations to continue to express their opinions, whatever the form of regulation; Amendment No 6 expresses our concern regarding the requirement to use Daytime Running Lights across the Union, as their current use by the most vulnerable users, motorcyclists and cyclists, would lose its value. In any case, we ask that this should not be obligatory until the matter has been studied in detail, or that Member States who ban Daytime Running Lights should be allowed to have positive discrimination for cyclists and motorcyclists. Mr President, we have tabled a series of amendments in this respect and we ask for them to be looked at or at least to be voted on. By accepting the Commission’s proposal, Parliament is explicitly accepting a loss of power over this important aspect, which concerns the safety and the lives of hundreds of European citizens, and we will be losing independence, judgment, transparency and control.

Mr President, Mr de Miguel, now that we are more or less a family, and in the interminable minute I have to speak for, I am not going to talk to you about immigration. Now it seems that everything you said to our generation about how good immigrants were does not apply to today’s immigrants. On the subject of issuing orders, I would ask you, who order so much by decree, please to ask the President, Mr Aznar, to bring here, to where things are decided, all that power-wielding that surrounds his actions in government in Spain, so that the proposal adopted by the College of Commissioners for the reform of the common fisheries policy does not go ahead, since it is a proposal which will send the shattered Spanish fishing fleet to the bottom of the sea. Prevent your party colleague, Mr Fischler, that friend of the farmers and fishermen of the south, from getting his own way. Do not invite him to Madrid – there are no fishermen, fishing ports or ice factories there. Invite him to Barbate, to Isla Cristina, where there are fishermen. Show him the results of his disastrous negotiation with Morocco and let him imagine what will happen to these European citizens if his proposal goes ahead. If you do not do so, the firmness you demonstrate there will be of little use when decisions are made here. Make a firm commitment against this fisheries proposal during the Seville Council and in that way, in my view, you will have salvaged the Spanish Presidency.

Mr President, I would like to congratulate the two rapporteurs, Mr Morillon and Mr Cohn-Bendit, on their work. I believe we should not forget the special situation currently affecting relations between the European Union and the Arab Maghreb; the economic association agreements are leading to a genuine unofficial enlargement towards the South and must bring us closer together on such important issues as immigration. The Maghreb representatives are constantly telling us that they will do nothing about immigration until the European Union offers them clear compensations. Neither must we forget potentially explosive situations such as the Western Sahara, which is impeding the creation of the Maghreb Arab Union, which is so important if the economic and political union of the Maghreb and its relations with the European Union are really going to be what they should be.

 Mr President, this is not a point of order; I would just like to draw attention to something. While Parliament has been worrying about the health of its Members, 24 000 people world-wide have died of hunger today, most of them women and children. The World Food Summit begins today in Rome and it should be noted that only 3% of the commitments given five years ago have been fulfilled. When will we discuss this in detail in Parliament? Allow me, therefore, to draw the attention of all politicians and institutions to this situation, since we have a great responsibility in this field.

Commissioner, please allow me to be a little forward. Do you know where Barbate is, or Isla Cristina? Do you know where Ayamonte, Almería or Motril are? Do you know anything about Andalusia other than the bitterness of its green olives? Without wanting to be harsh, Commissioner, you have set a new record in terms of proposals to destroy employment which will be difficult to break. Have you or anyone from your team considered that your proposals for reforming the CFP only add to the effect of the failure of the disastrous negotiation with Morocco to renew a traditional fisheries agreement that would prevent the destruction of thousands of small-scale fishing jobs? Commissioner, you globalised fishing in the south of Europe, and ensured that the place occupied by a small-scale fleet, under an agreement between Morocco and the European Union, which respected biological rest periods and maintained very close control of nets and meshes, should now be taken in these fishing grounds by a fleet which does not respect rest periods, and whose nets are not controlled at all. A proportion of their catches is not landed and they do not generate local employment, as the Community fleet did. Commissioner, you have presented a proposed CFP which perfectly quantifies the scrappings and the job losses, but leaves it completely unclear what the solutions to alleviating the social and economic problems caused by your proposal are to be. Do you know where the money we need is going to come from? The intention is that we now incorporate unemployed fishermen into the tourism sector. More hotels, more golf courses, Commissioner? Is this what you call sustainable development? Is this what diversifying the economies of the regions means? Do you realise that when you prohibit modernisation you also prohibit the sustainability of fishing, a form of fishing that is more respectful of the environment, of those fishing grounds that fishermen have most interest in respecting? Through your proposals you are destroying the only fleet that generates employment and also respects the environment; the small-scale fleet. They also prohibit the creation of mixed undertakings, the only solution which allowed us to resolve the problems resulting from cases such as Morocco. Although we are going to make the scrap merchants richer, I suppose! Finally, your proposal will not only affect the traditional employment and culture of peoples you do not know, but it will also considerably increase the cost to consumers of one of the essential ingredients of the Mediterranean diet, a healthy and balanced diet, without cholesterol, which as a result of your proposals we will lose in favour of the junk food which is so popular in the North of Europe.

Mr President, Commissioner, I would firstly like to congratulate Mrs Torres Marques on her magnificent work. Today, tourism is one of the most important sectors in the European Union and the absolute number one objective in certain regions in which tourism provides the majority of their gross domestic product and it is essential to the development and cohesion of these regions that they themselves also have significant common policies in other fields. The lack of a legislative basis which would make this sector more operative and remove it from the field of unanimous decision-making within the Council will give impetus to this sector, which is in the hands of the large tour operators and completely outside the control of this House. We therefore need decisions to be taken by qualified majority voting for tourism in the European Union. The necessary action to protect the consumer must not lead us to forget the protection of the interests of the countries and regions for which tourism is a product, which is also necessary. The impact of tourism on regional planning, the impact on the environment, the traditional agriculture sector, employment, transport and its essential infrastructures, as well as relations with other non-Community States which are providers and receivers of tourism, in which that tourism generates wealth and employment, make the adoption of an operative decision urgent. The creation of a system of quality and efficiency indicators for tourism and the integrated management of the coastal areas within the field of policies at local, regional and national level must appear in a directive and not in a mere recommendation. An in-depth analysis should be made of the impact of fiscal transport measures on tourism and the environmental impact of tourism and, finally, the Convention and the Council should work in this direction. We therefore also need a common umbrella, a common policy and also common promotion for tourism in the European Union.

 Mr President, I would like to thank Mrs Pack for her report, and the Commission for the efforts it is making to remove obstacles to strengthening and promoting sport. I believe that if we want the European Year of Education through Sport – 2004 – to be a success, we must work hard to ensure that it does not end up as just another action that is set up by the EU but which never actually reaches the citizens. In this regard, and so that this action does not go unnoticed, I think we need to make use of all the institutions at local, regional and national level that have been working for a long time to promote the educational value of sport. These institutions should contribute to this action in a coordinated fashion, contributing synergies, which is the most important thing. The promotion, dissemination and study of all sciences related to physical activity and sport is the best weapon we have to educate people against intolerance and xenophobia and to support social integration.

 Mr President, I agree with most of the statements that have been made today and, therefore, if you do not mind, I shall not repeat them. Instead, I shall focus on other aspects of Euro-Mediterranean cooperation, which is of such great importance. The adoption of the action plan between the European Union and the twelve States bordering the Mediterranean is a step forwards in the much-needed creation of a Mediterranean free trade area, which I would call a genuine form of discreet enlargement towards the South. In formalising this project, we must ensure that criteria of sustainability and ecological, economic and social benefit for both sides of the Mediterranean are taken into account in sectors such as agriculture. In this process it is a matter of priority to foster mutual knowledge and cultural ties between peoples. We saw that the first action to be taken when the tanks entered the refugee camps was to ban the media. For this reason, we must promote joint projects such as a Euro-Mediterranean television service that would maintain stations in all the States bordering the Mediterranean, and which would broadcast in all of the region’s languages and provide live transparency for this action plan and others. Ladies and gentlemen, let us learn the lesson of what happened in Jenin. We must prevent any repetition of these episodes and be prepared to address and resolve issues as explosive as this one – or as in the case of the Western Sahara, to which no one in this Chamber has referred – and which are extremely important to the creation of an Arab Maghreb union.
Bautista Ojeda (Verts/ALE

 Mr President, Commissioner, I must first congratulate the rapporteur, Mr Esteve, on his wide-ranging and detailed report, which covers each and every one of the concerns and uncertainties regarding Euro-Mediterranean cooperation. Re-launching the Barcelona Process is more necessary than ever in the interests of peace and stability. This should involve strengthening Euro-Mediterranean dialogue. We need to tackle crucial issues such as the need to promote democratic values and fundamental rights, so flagrantly disregarded in the conflict in the Middle East. Other factors to be considered include the terrorist threat and matters relating to economic cooperation, the environmental aspects of development, emigration and drug trafficking. I shall focus on just a few areas in the short time available to me. Setting up a free trade area might seem the obvious way of stimulating the economy and ensuring that the people of the southern shores of the Mediterranean are not dying of starvation whilst on its northern shores we are being killed by cholesterol. It is important to ensure however that such a free trade area does not become a time bomb that would destroy all the efforts made by countries in southern Europe to achieve genuine convergence and genuine cohesion, something they do not yet enjoy. The far-reaching changes anticipated within the European Union should be taken into account when establishing a free trade area. I refer to the reform of the common agricultural policy and to enlargement. Trade in agricultural products is both necessary and useful, but caution is called for. It is important to promote political dialogue amongst our Mediterranean partners, in addition to dialogue between them and the Union. It does not seem logical to strengthen the Association Agreement without strengthening the South-South dialogue. Closed border situations in diplomatic relations cannot continue. International agreements must be complied with for the coastal nations to be in a credible position in relation to the Union. This is certainly true of the potentially explosive situation in the Western Sahara. Further, the need to combat terrorism should not be used as a weapon or an excuse for doing away with a political opponent or an enemy. Yasser Arafat has to be present as a recognised interlocutor if peace is to be achieved. Following the attacks on 11 September, dialogue and mutual understanding have become essential. Those attacks resulted in a deep divide between the two cultures. This has to be bridged. Cultural and social exchanges must therefore be encouraged, through the promotion of mutual information by means of shared means of communication such as Euro-Mediterranean television. In conclusion, the important role the regions in southern Europe are already playing and will continue to play with regard to Euro-Mediterranean cooperation should not be overlooked.

Madam President, Commissioner, I would like to thank the Committee on Agriculture and Rural Development for adopting this report by unanimity. In addition, I should like to recall Parliament’s considerable institutional support to the nuts and locust beans sector. This is evidenced in a number of resolutions testifying to the significance of this sector within the Union. At the Council of Agriculture Ministers in July 2001, Commissioner Fischler announced that a detailed study of the Community nuts sector would be undertaken. The Commissioner also stated that if appropriate, specific proposals to benefit the sector would be made, to follow on from the improvement plans expiring in 2001. In the light of this situation, the Commission has proposed an additional one-year extension of the improvement plans. I have certainly welcomed this. Nonetheless, I would like to make it clear that I trust it will be the last transitional instrument, to be followed by a permanent proposal. Such a proposal must ensure the survival of the sector and put an end to the difficulties and uncertainty European Union producers are experiencing. The main aim of our report was to settle the issue of permanent support measures once and for all. The nuts sector is very important to the Union from a social, economic and environmental point of view. Over a million hectares are devoted to these crops. They extend across the Mediterranean countries, and the land is mostly located in very disadvantaged areas where agriculture is difficult. Much of the soil is hillside or arid. These products therefore have to overcome many difficulties to remain on the market and be economically viable without direct support from public institutions. The difficulties are exacerbated by strong outside competition. For instance, there are hazelnuts from Turkey and almonds from the United States. In both cases the conditions of production bear no comparison to those in Europe. In addition, the outside products benefit from tariff concessions under international agreements. The nuts sector is an example of multifunctional production and is essential to the socio-economic survival of many families in rural areas of the Union. This is because of its role in regional planning, since no alternative crops exist, and also because of its part in environmental conservation. It helps prevent erosion and is important in combating fires. It also preserves indigenous genetic material, which is of great organolectic value. In the light of this difficult situation and lack of competitiveness in 1989, the Commission adopted a package of specific measures. These were aimed mainly at raising the quality and competitiveness of the products. The ten-year improvement plans were due to expire in 2000 but were extended until 15 July 2001. The results of the plans proved positive. There were notable improvements in production and marketing. Unfortunately the same was not true of competitiveness, due to the difficult structural conditions at the outset. The Commission’s present proposal would allow these last plans to be extended to 15 June 2002 with the Community contribution decreasing from 82 to 75%. Taking the specific case of hazelnuts, the payment per kilo is retained for the 2001-2002 harvest. Payments will only be made, however, to members of producer organisations not eligible for the extension. The Committee on Agriculture and Rural Development has attempted to introduce considerable improvements to the executive committee’s proposal through its amendment. Regarding the restrictions on support for hazelnut production, we believe that it is not acceptable to withhold it from those producer organisations wishing to benefit from the extension of improvement schemes. This would amount to discrimination between producers’ organisations, giving some of them an unfair advantage. As for the level of national cofinancing, the increase on the current commitment proposed for the extended plans cannot be justified. In this connection, the percentage relating to nuts is minimal and does not justify the proposal. As for the areas covered by the plans and entitled to aid, the percentage should be retained on the basis of the area certified in the last year’s plans and not the area for which aid has been requested. The Committee on Agriculture is of the opinion that in order to improve awareness and production monitoring, provision must be made to set up a geographical information system. The committee is also on record as advocating the need to establish a permanent framework for aid to the sector. Further, the committee has argued for ongoing support in the form of aid per hectare to guarantee maintenance of the producers’ income in a situation of sustainable exploitation. Hence the advisability of linking this latest extension to permanent aid, the ultimate aim being to consolidate a system of ongoing aid channelled through the producer organisations. I must not conclude without mentioning the Committee on Agriculture’s specific request that chestnuts be included in the nuts sector. The protection of this tree and fruit associated with forested areas and ancient culinary traditions is crucial to preserving a very important ecosystem that is obviously being encroached upon. It also has a bearing on the related environmental issues. Finally, I should like to point out that two identical amendments have been put to plenary. They both aim at increasing support to hazelnuts by means of an additional marketing season. I am unable to support these amendments although I appreciate and share concerns over the difficulties currently experienced in marketing hazelnuts. The request for a permanent regime implies that support to hazelnuts would be covered by that regime. It is therefore not appropriate to extend still further a temporary arrangement with a set expiry date that has merely generated uncertainty. Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, I trust we shall be able to continue enjoying the best desserts, the best nougat, and all those products manufactured with the best and most delicious hazelnuts and almonds in the world.

 Madam President, I too welcome the work done by Mr Cunha in the Committee on Agriculture. As an aside, it was stated that Andalusia is a very rich agricultural area. I have to say that I would be delighted with an income from agriculture as high as that enjoyed by the citizens represented by Mrs Auroi, and so would my Andalusian constituents. I side with those in favour of retaining aid to farmers, although I do not smoke myself and advise everyone not to take it up or to stop. I believe it would be a mistake to reduce the cultivation of tobacco or do away with it altogether. My reasons are that this would entail a high social cost and that no suitable alternative crops have been identified. It should also be remembered that those who advocate cutting off aid to the sector on the grounds of health protection fail to take into account that subsidising European production would have no impact on consumption. This is because the European Union imports 70% of its raw tobacco. Nonetheless, we have already been presented with a proposal providing for gradual elimination of tobacco without the relevant studies to ensure alternative sources of income following replacement of this crop. There are no such alternative sources of income at present. Discussion of reform can only begin when the results of assessment of the COM in tobacco are available, not in any event before 2003. The Commission aims to replace agricultural research with action to support the development of specific initiatives encouraging tobacco producers to change to other crops and engage in alternative economic activities generating employment. Deductions from the producers’ premiums are to be implemented progressively starting in 2004. The Community Fund financed by deductions from the subsidies has been underused. This was due to serious mismanagement by the Commission. If the latter handled the existing budget so badly, I have grave misgivings as to whether it would do better with a significantly larger sum. It should be recalled that there have hardly been any calls to tender so far. The Fund must of course continue to serve its purpose and pursue research into varieties more suited to demand and causing as little harm as possible. Obviously it must also investigate alternative uses for raw tobacco and its environmental impact. Increased deductions should not be an excuse for covert reductions of the producers’ premiums. I should like to conclude by emphasising the important social and economic role played by tobacco cultivation. It calls for a sizeable workforce on family plots. The debate on tobacco and public health should not therefore be restricted to the agricultural context, targeting the weakest link in the chain of tobacco production.

Mr President, I would like to point out that, just when we are going to debate and vote on the ‘Women and fundamentalism’ report by Mrs Izquierdo Rojo – and if we do nothing to prevent it – a thirty-year-old Nigerian woman, accused of adultery, will be put to death by stoning. On the 18th of this month – and I repeat, if we do nothing to prevent it – we will once again see barbaric television pictures of a person buried up to their waist and then stoned to death. This is an unjust, discriminatory and savage way of applying the Sharia, the Islamic law. I would therefore ask you to address the appropriate representations, pressure and initiatives to the Nigerian government and the President of Nigeria in order to prevent this murder and safeguard the fundamental rights of Nigerian women.

Mr President, Mr President of the Commission, Mr President-in-Office of the Council, Spain will endow the Presidency of the European Union with a proposed set of priorities which shows ambition and will. European integration today means strengthening freedoms, isolating intolerance and making that integration compatible with the necessary fight against terrorism. The priority given by Spain to enlargement is not accompanied by the necessary commitments to guarantee the legitimate objectives of the Objective 1 territories. Vital to me, as a supporter of Andalusian autonomy, in order to safeguard the future, are the reform of the common agricultural policy, the debate on rural development, codecision in agriculture and food safety, in order to prevent extremely costly crises and alarm amongst consumers. The presence of the autonomous communities in the Council when issues relating to our interests and competences are dealt with will always be positive and enriching. Reflect the reality of Spain in Europe. Do not try to hide it, Mr Aznar. The autonomous communities are also States. A plural Spain in a plural Europe, creating more Union. Take that political and social reality further. Mr Aznar, you have not explicitly mentioned Morocco in your speech. Include it in your Presidency. Mr Aznar, please do not let the neutrality of the Presidency paralyse our legitimate Europeanist objective of cohesion. Let us be firm, but let us also talk.

Madam President, as you are well aware, the situation caused by ETA’s terrorism in Spain is horrendous, and I would like to take this opportunity to thank you for your work during your Presidency. I would like to say once again that I totally reject ETA and all those who support it or apologise for it. Madam President, both myself and my party have been seriously slandered in some sections of the Spanish media, since, through illness, I was not able to attend the last part-session in Brussels, where a debate and a vote were held on Mr Watson’s report, which I fully supported through various press releases which were sent to all the Spanish media 24 hours before the debate and the vote, and which were systematically hushed up. For all these reasons, Madam President, I would ask for your support in this situation in which I have been unable to defend myself. To this end, since my position and that of my party was clear, public and expressed prior to the vote, I would like to ask you formally that my vote in favour of the Watson report and Amendments Nos 117 and 118 be registered, as that is how I would have voted had I been present. Furthermore, I would point out that the inclusion of my vote would not significantly alter the final result of the vote. Finally, I would like to publicly thank the Efe Agency, the only one to express the truth in its communications. We will always support the defence of life and the most fundamental rights and we will always be against murderers and those who justify and support them.

 Mr President, Commissioner, I would like to congratulate both the committee responsible and Mrs Flemming for the work they have done. The Committee on Agriculture and Rural Development welcomes the communication from the Commission. A suitable pricing policy for irrigation water will play a fundamental role in encouraging more efficient and sustainable use of water in agriculture, its largest consumer, and will free up resources for other uses, thereby reducing environmental pressures. The analysis of the pricing of irrigation water is complex, due to the wide range of agricultural uses in the European Union and also regional differences in the need and availability of water for agricultural usage. Water is, essentially, the very backbone of the agricultural community in the Mediterranean regions. Without water, nothing grows, apart from the controversial almond trees. The pricing policy should be heterogeneous, taking into account the ‘polluter pays’ principle, as well as the social, environmental, economic, geographical and climatic variations in regions that no doubt will be the most affected by this pricing policy. The financial, environmental and resource costs of irrigation farming require differential treatment if gradual-recovery objectives are to be achieved. For this reason, the introduction of this policy should be progressive, transparent and must be adapted to local requirements. In this way, information to irrigation farmers and the adaptation and optimisation of infrastructures and irrigation techniques should be applied in parallel so that farmers can accept this policy. Ladies and gentlemen, in its current form the CAP does not help to achieve the objectives set out in the framework directive, which means we must seek coherence between these two policies in order to guarantee the protection of European agriculture’s functional model. Today, in Europe, water is a factor for cohesion between countries. The revision of Agenda 2000 on the development of agri-environmental measures should include the objectives of water policies. This will require the revision of certain types of aid, the application of eco-conditionality and the recognition of the right to adequate compensation for more vulnerable farmers, such as those who work on family holdings, with the aim of promoting the sustainable use of water and an integrated rural development.

Madam President-in-Office of the Council, you have not commented because clearly, as you said, the Spanish State has still not made any formal proposal.

Mr President, Commissioner, illegal immigration is a daily phenomenon at all of the European Union’s borders, affecting certain regions with particular intensity and with an enormous humanitarian, social and economic impact. Please allow me to focus on those border regions of the Union which, like Andalusia, most vividly experience the arrival of dozens of people each day. Andalusia, owing to its geographical proximity to the Maghreb, is enduring great migratory pressure without having the appropriate instruments for confronting it. The Spanish administration has publicly acknowledged that the situation is unsustainable and, furthermore, bilateral relations with the Maghreb and the Kingdom of Morocco are difficult at the moment due to problems related to fishing, drug-trafficking and illegal immigration itself. Some of us have been arguing for years that, within the framework of the Schengen Agreement, the special status of border regions such as Andalusia should be recognised and that these areas of the European Union should be provided with instruments which would allow them to deal with the arrival of these immigrants more effectively. They should also be given the power to propose measures to the central government and to the European Union relating to work, residence and the necessary social integration of people who are forced to emigrate across the Straits of Gibraltar to reception regions such as Andalusia.

 Commissioner, once again, the report submitted by the European Commission on the operation of the common organisation of the market in fruit and vegetables, with a view to a future reform, is a disappointment. It is not only a disappointment to Parliament, because it adopts almost none of the recommendations of the requests contained in the Resolution of 26 October 2000, but it is also a disappointment to the whole production sector. The report does not adopt the work and the suggestions of the Committee on Agriculture and Rural Development or those of Parliament itself, despite the fact that Commissioner Fischler stated a while ago that these would be taken into consideration. The report is incomplete: it fails to present practical solutions and nor does it make an in-depth study of the situation. Neither time nor energy has been expended on it and, I repeat, it is a disappointment. No solutions have been suggested for a sector which, in some parts of the European Union, is responsible for 25% of total agricultural output and provides the most employment. Are you aware, Commissioner, that out of every EUR 6 received by a fruit and vegetable producer in southern Europe, only EUR 0.012 comes from the European Union? Do you think that this can be called a genuine common organisation of the market or a real system of support? Is the Commission aware of this sector’s capacity for absorbing employees, particularly labour from the Maghreb, and does it realise, furthermore, that this sector has been more badly affected than any other by the liberalisation of trade with the countries from which these workers come? Do you not think that if it can find work for so many people – in objective 1 territories – we should take this into consideration and support the sector wholeheartedly instead of continuing to force farmers to bear the whole burden? Commissioner, please undertake the necessary reforms that will provide real and unequivocal support for fruit and vegetable producers’ organisations. Please give real support, which has until now been lacking and which will enable these to increase not production, but the already high levels of food quality and safety and which will resolve the environmental problems affecting the sector. Please use the proposed reform to facilitate the concentration of supply in the face of distribution monopolies, the operators who dominate the market and who set their own prices and conditions. Please propose solutions that put an end to the problems of the operational programmes and funds, the excessive bureaucracy and the harmful consequences of trade agreements with third countries. Commissioner, how many times must we in Parliament repeat that the nut sector requires a definitive solution? How many times must we request that, until the reform of the market in the form of aid per hectare takes place, the improvement plans for the nut sector, which are crucial to preserving rural life in some very underdeveloped areas, which have no real alternatives, be extended? Commissioner, let us not make things so easy for the United States, Turkey or China. Let us protect our farmers and the nuts they grow, at least to the same degree to which these countries protect their farmers and crops. For months now, uncertainty has reigned in the production sector. In Andalusia, people have been shouting slogans such as ‘We won’t swap fish for tomatoes’ in an allusion to the agricultural concessions made to producers from the Maghreb during the fisheries negotiations. The Commission has already ensured that we will not have fish and is now on the way to ensuring that we will not have tomatoes either.

 Mr President, Commissioner, I should like to begin by thanking the Committee on Agriculture and Rural Development for its report, and also by thanking the rapporteur, Mr Jové Peres, for his excellent input. In my opinion, the Commission’s proposal to extend the current aid regime for a further two years is sound. However, I share the sector’s concern at the Commission’s intention to resort entirely to an operational geographical oil information system for future monitoring of this regime. We feel this could prove a good monitoring tool, but only a complementary one. We believe it would be more useful and fairer to put in place appropriate checks at the oil mills, not just a geographical information system. Hopefully, such checks would be more effective in preventing fraud. We do not agree with the Commission’s proposal where it introduces a new concept, that of economic operators. This concept is quite unclear. Any one of us could set up tomorrow as an economic agents’ organisation and withhold significant funds from those genuinely involved in oil production, namely producers’ or interbranch organisations recognised by the Member States themselves. In our judgement, the key element of the strategy to promote quality is a permanent ban on the marketing of blends of olive oil and other fats. This is essential to pursue fraudulent blending with seed oil. The ban must be central to management of the olive oil market, so as to avoid defrauding customers and to establish a clear policy on quality and food safety. We endorse the general feeling within the Committee on Agriculture concerning the new designations. They result from extensive consultation with the sector, as does the reduction of maximum permitted acidity for extra virgin oil. Ladies and gentlemen, no other crop is so closely linked with the people of the Mediterranean and with their culture. No other crop shaped the landscape over thousands of years, as this one has. We are convinced of the environmental value of olive groves in maintaining biodiversity and stemming the advance of desertification. Those of us who live in the area are especially aware of this. In drafting programmes aimed at improving the environmental impact of olive groves, consideration should therefore also be given to recycling material removed when pruning the groves. Both the olive wood and the leaves can be used commercially, thus taking full advantage of all the by-products of cultivation.

Mr President, Commissioner, debates that should really be technical are often political, such as the one that brings us here today: water management and water plans, which are necessary to support and develop our communities, but not at any price. Plans cannot be established by law behind citizens’ backs and without taking into account their opinions, the opinion of social agents and of the scientific community, the territories affected, through development considerations, which focus more on concrete than on where to get water from and actually assessing who needs it and why. As Andalusians, from one of the driest areas in the European Union, with very considerable water requirements, due to the two main economic activities, agriculture and tourism, and with absolutely unpredictable weather, we are concerned about the efficiency of the project, the cost/benefit relationship, the real possibility of these projects supporting the area and not causing conflict between communities. Our hydrological plan would always start with the word ‘save’, and the last words would be ‘transfer’ and ‘desalination’. Ladies and gentlemen, the best reservoir is saving. Our duty is to ask for water, but also to demand that efforts first be made to make the best possible use of the existing resources, valuing this scarce resource as it should be valued, improving irrigation in agriculture, investing in optimising the efficiency of distribution networks – which are in many cases obsolete and have major leaks – regaining control of hydraulics and regenerating soil and vegetation. Special attention needs to be paid to underground water, preventing it from being over-used, to sewage treatment and to the essential environmental impact studies, particularly in areas such as mine, where specially protected natural areas are a precious asset to be preserved. These plans also need to be in line with the Community directives on water, Natura sites, habitat, birds, etc., in conjunction with the national irrigation plans that should be in accordance with the forthcoming review of the common agricultural policy and rural development in order to deepen essential sustainable development. We have the opportunity to draw up a sustainable, innovative and model plan. Let us do so. Now, more than ever, we can’t please everyone.

– Mr President, Commissioner, I would first like to congratulate the Committee on Agriculture and Rural Development and the rapporteur on the report presented and the work undertaken. It reveals the anxiety affecting this important sector of European agriculture and, more particularly, significant areas of Greece and Andalusia, the main producer regions. Cotton is a traditional crop which provides a livelihood for thousands of European families for whom there is hardly any alternative source of income. There is a significant cotton shortfall in the European Union; we can only meet 40% of demand, and it remains the best natural fibre for fabric production, when compared to synthetic fibres. Furthermore, cotton has replaced other intensive crops which generate more pollution and greater surpluses. However, despite the improvements, it is true that there are still environmental problems we need to solve. Commissioner, we support the Commission’s proposal of maintaining the present system of production aid, based on the compensation payments system. However, we do not believe that imposing stiffer penalties is the right way to restrict expenditure on this sector. It is simplistic to talk of containing spending and only to present budgetary considerations for reforming the aid system, when what is really happening is that farmers’ incomes are falling whilst we are witnessing an increase in imports from outside the European Union. This constitutes a structural change, since expenditure has been determined principally by changes to international prices, not by an actual increase in the area of land under cultivation. Stiffer penalties will doubtless lead to greater concentration of the sector. It will pass into the hands of a few individuals and the viability of family farms will be seriously threatened. However, cotton growing will not cease, which is the intention. We believe that the producers’ organisations are the best means of improving the effectiveness of the necessary self-regulation measures concerning production and environmental protection. In conclusion I should like to stress that the Commission must gradually recognise the actual production in these areas. It should adjust guaranteed national quantities, bringing them into line with actual production of cotton, a product we do not produce enough of in the Union.

Mr President, Commissioner, I would like to start by congratulating the rapporteur and the Committee on Agriculture and Rural Development on the unanimity evident at the vote and throughout the drafting of this report identifying the main concerns felt by the sector. The European Parliament’s resolution of 16 June contains an ongoing appeal for the search for a solution which will provide for direct support for farmers’ income to be awarded, enabling production to continue and preventing the depopulation of very underprivileged areas. I should like to highlight how these crops contribute to environmental conservation in the most desertified areas of the Union. This is true of almonds and hazelnuts, for example. As for chestnuts, they are produced in indigenous Community forests, which are preserved for that purpose. The Commission is therefore called upon to put forward proposals offering clear support to the sector. A flat rate of aid per hectare to be administered by producers’ organisations should be introduced and the structural crisis in the sector should be addressed. In conclusion, the present arrangements should be extended until the introduction of permanent support measures for these products. They are of regional importance, offer a high level of food safety, are a source of energy in the Mediterranean diet and make a valuable contribution to safeguarding the environment.

Mr President, Commissioner, the high number of motorcycles on the roads and in the cities of the European Union is a clear reality, particularly in the Mediterranean Member States, which enjoy good weather throughout the year. Mr Lange’s report, whose environmental concern our group shares, constantly compares 2- and 3-wheel vehicles with 4-wheel vehicles. However, their ease of use, the fluidity that they give to traffic in cities, their simplicity for parking and the low cost of purchasing and maintaining them should be more than sufficient reason for the necessary anti-pollution measures not to decrease their use. The European industry needs more time to apply the proposed measures. I therefore ask that the Commission, in cooperation with the manufacturers, evaluate the applicability and the cost-efficiency relationship of these measures and essentially of the periods proposed, as we run the risk of indirectly favouring the large companies in the sector, which are precisely not the European ones. We need tax incentives to facilitate the sale and use of less-polluting vehicles that are easy to use, improve traffic and are more integrated into our cities.

Mr President, Commissioner, firstly my group, the Group of the Greens, would like to congratulate Mr Bakopoulos on his report, which we agree with completely. We also congratulate the Commission on its proposal and we are genuinely pleased with the creation of this committee on maritime safety which is going to unify in a very significant way and coordinate the application of 12 directives and 3 regulations. Commissioner, you have been determined to unify sky, land and sea and in the end you are going to manage it. I truly hope that you do manage it. Our group will support you. I believe the principle of caution and precaution must fundamentally prevail so that these directives, standards and international agreements are made more demanding, as this committee on maritime safety proposes. We are going to make a series of recommendations. We believe that the committee on maritime safety must not simply be a committee which does a reasonable job from an administrative point of view, but that it must incorporate the feelings of non-governmental organisations, of environmental protection organisations and of unions so that all these views may be represented. We also recommend that the committee puts a special emphasis on the areas in a special geographical position, with special traffic conditions, with special environmental circumstances such as, for example, the Straits of Gibraltar or the English Channel, where we all know that the number of accidents and incidents is well above the average, and where the dumping of crude oil has a great environmental impact and a great economic impact on tourist areas. We therefore hope that the committee places special emphasis on these areas with special conditions, and I would like to ask you two questions in this regard: how will the work of the committee on maritime safety and the European Maritime Safety Agency, which is going to be established soon, be coordinated? Is this committee also going to manage or work on the three legislative initiatives contained in the Erika II package?

 Mr President, Commissioner, the BSE crisis has simply highlighted and revealed to public opinion in Europe the fragility and lack of rigour in the way Member States’ comply with and observe European rules on potentially dangerous materials used in the manufacture of animal feedingstuffs. Despite all the debates held on the crisis itself, we still allow some potentially dangerous substances to enter the food chain, since, for example, there is still no ban on animal fat for animal consumption. Our citizens, who are powerless in the face of political decisions taken by politicians whose criteria are above all economic, demand greater rigour and responsibility. What responsibilities will the Member States, the Commission and Parliament itself adopt with regard to the people affected by the human form of BSE? There is still no uniformity in the measures adopted by the Council, which means that the precautionary principle will lose its effectiveness. Further research is required to discover the nature and the transmission mechanisms of this disease in all its forms and, lastly, we must have greater controls for plants producing animal feedingstuffs, which are a major factor in the transmission of the disease. If codecision in agriculture truly existed, this crisis would have taken a very different direction.

Mr President, I am going to focus on an aspect of the common strategy for the Mediterranean region which is not being taken into account in all respects: the South-South dialogue, which is an important driving force within the strategy for relations between the European Union and the Maghreb countries. The creation of centralised authorities and mechanisms which thoroughly monitor the most pressing problems is essential. The management of projects on specific points and on common aspects is a need which has become a real one in relation to cases in which, on a private level, citizens and cities from both sides of the Straits of Gibraltar have been cooperating with wonderful results and without Community patronage. For the purposes of this local management, it would be necessary to create a new body which, as a decentralised and permanent mechanism, would bring together all the institutional, political and social leaders of these territories which are so close and yet so far away. The 14 kilometres which separate the European Union from the Maghreb are real, but let us ensure that this does not become an insuperable distance which prevents the closest possible cooperation. Immigration, its causes and consequences – which are sometimes terrible and irreparable – business, agricultural and fishing exchanges, social, technical, educational and university exchanges, aspects of common development, such as those in the energy sector, and the essential democratising political aspects which the European Union must promote in those countries all require the creation of new mechanisms and instruments which, in a decentralised fashion, would respond to these needs, which are local but which have widespread repercussions.

Mr President, Commissioner, firstly I would like to express my thanks for the magnificent work done by Mrs Hedkvist Petersen. There are many reasons for the accidents and the extremely high number of victims on European roads. The causes are many and varied, and the report has been able to mention and summarise the most important ones. Furthermore, the Commission communication on priorities in road safety contains six points detailing the aspects on which we can have the greatest impact in order to achieve better results. I am going to focus on the aspects which refer to the management of the black spots on the roads and the reduction of the effects of impacts on road infrastructures. A high number of accident victims are users of two-wheeled vehicles, motorcyclists and cyclists, for which roads are also intended. For cultural and climatic reasons, there are an extraordinary number of these accidents in certain Member States. Serious studies have concluded that the majority of serious accidents or deaths amongst these groups result from impacts with crash barriers, that is to say, against roadside protective barriers or against vertical road signs, both of which are designed and created for four-wheeled vehicles. The majority of these accidents happen at the black spots which some Member States are indicating and identifying. My amendment of the legislative proposal on the design and placing of these soft protective barriers at these black spots is not therefore gratuitous. We must not be satisfied with a mere recommendation to the Member States or leave this simply to be dealt with through subsidiarity, which would greatly affect its implementation. We must now be bold. Let us legislate, let us seek a greater degree of harmonisation, let us promote measures for the rational and safe use of roads by pedestrians and cyclists, and let us seek formulas to reduce heavy traffic, at least in populated areas; let us harmonise the speed limits by means of an ambitious legal framework, as the Commission recommended in 1986, thereby removing the Member States’ inertia. Let us be vigilant of the environmental impact of traffic, such as noise and environmental pollution. I would also like to reiterate the importance of legislating on the maximum permitted levels of alcohol. Finally, I would like to thank the Commissioner for being so very open to our proposals.

 Mr President, Commissioner, first of all I should like to give Mr Parish my thanks, congratulations and support for his report. In these times when the younger generation can see that the quality of life is no longer closely linked to industrialisation and cities and large commercial centres, we have the obligation in the Union to encourage and help the younger generation to take over from the older so that the cycle of life and people in agriculture may be completed by means of new Community initiatives that have the young farmer as their priority objective. We must put into practice the principles and actions proposed in this own-initiative report so as to make rural life more attractive to young people, thus preventing depopulation of the countryside. This social group is the future basis of the Common Agricultural Policy; we have to increase installation aids and supplementary investment grants for this group, particularly in those structurally less-favoured areas where abandoned holdings and deserted villages are common, where young people can revive the rural economy. All this will be thanks to the development of new products of regional interest, such as agro-tourism and rural tourism, or through repopulating these natural spaces with animal and plant species, contributing to the sustainable and lasting development of the area.

 Mr President, I am not going to speak about anything that we are going to debate now, and I apologise for departing from the agenda. This very evening I have learnt that ten members of the environmentalist organisation, Greenpeace, ten pacifist environmentalists, have been arrested by the military authorities of the Rock of Gibraltar, because they were trying to get near the submarine Tireless 
with a placard expressing what I believe everyone thinks: that the sea should not be occupied by nuclear energy. These environmentalists are still under arrest, and since Parliament has been, let us say, rather insensitive about safeguarding the interests of the citizens of the Campo de Gibraltar and Algeciras Bay, I ask at least that appropriate steps should be taken so that these pacifist environmentalists can sleep in their own homes. Thank you very much.

 Mr President, we are faced with the total inability of the Commission and the Council to negotiate on behalf of the citizens. The latest Euro-barometer data shows scepticism is rising, perhaps as a true reflection of this inability to negotiate. In the agreement with Morocco they have had no weight whatsoever. Even the French Presidency told us at the time that it was unable to secure an agreement. We are going to have a major social problem on our hands, and we have no real alternative. Now some of our fishing towns are going to develop their economy partly around and thanks to the drug that Morocco grows and markets and we Europeans consume. To Moroccan blackmail of negotiating with the resources of some fishing grounds that belong to the Sahrawi people, the Commission responds by seeing Community fishermen as real enemies, cutting their quotas and signalling to Morocco that that is the way to go, without proposing an alternative. Can anybody be sure today that all the Community boats that have had anything to do with fishing in Morocco are tied up? Well, then, Morocco-European Union relations must be seriously affected. All the funds poured into this agreement should be used to finance alternatives in the areas affected. Meanwhile, the Commission Presidency is trying to settle a very long-standing problem at the last minute. We are concerned that the solution proposed is just a makeshift solution for the sake of the media and not a real solution to the problem.

Mr President, Commissioner, please bring some order here, if you can. I believe that you can. The presence of a broken down nuclear submarine in the waters of the Bay of Algeciras has now unfortunately become a diplomatic conflict between a colonial and nuclear military power and a second category Member State, according to the latest classification in Nice, which does not demand its rights and gives in to infantile explanations. Article 37 of the Euratom Treaty is not being complied with, nor are important directives on radioactive protection, and you, ladies and gentlemen of the Commission, know this and merely look the other way. It seems that you do not want internal conflicts, so why sign Treaties? Where, here and now, is the Charter of Fundamental Rights for the citizens of Gibraltar and Algeciras and the Andalusians of the area? Have you received the general information relating to the evacuation plan of the British authorities, which they are obliged to produce? The plan should include the evacuation and the possibility of an accident which contaminates another Member State, a possible cross-border contamination. You know this. What are you doing? Have you replied to the complaint of the Association of Municipalities of Campo de Gibraltar
? When is the Committee on Petitions going to reply to a communication presented and signed by more than 35 associations – collectives, unions and municipalities – from the area? Let us forget about the yellow submarine and other tomfoolery, which has no place here. This is now real. Let us be serious. Ladies and gentlemen, your initial jeers, when I condemned this case on 5 July, and your laughter, have simply increased the desire of the Andalusian people to be respected and not to be humiliated with shameful explanations and to be obliged to endure an unnecessary situation of risk. Finally, do not allow the repair of this submarine in an inappropriate base. Ask and demand that it be removed when the technical and climatic conditions allow it. Commissioners, do not allow our gorgeous bay to become nothing but a workshop for nuclear junk.

 Mr President, Commissioner, I am not going to repeat what has been said this morning in this plenary sitting and has been being said for almost a year. Ladies and gentlemen, the truth is that the Community fleets in Andalusia, the Canaries, Galicia and Portugal are in dock due to the lack of a fisheries agreement. Nor do I want to blame the Commission again for its lack of success in the negotiations or for the delay in beginning to put pressure on Morocco. This has already been done. This Andalusian MEP has been negotiating and proposing initiatives for a year in corridors, in offices, in the Committee on Fisheries and in the hearings with the Commissioner so that the highly specific idiosyncrasies of the Andalusian fishing fleet working in Morocco would be taken into account. We need a practical fisheries agreement. We do not want an agreement in which the interests of this large coastal fishing fleet are not reflected. Extremely important fishing towns in the south Atlantic zone – Huelva and Cadiz – and the southern Mediterranean – Malaga, Granada and Almeria – depend on this agreement. They have no alternative to fishing. Furthermore, the social repercussions of this fleet lying in dock are extremely serious and are, in some cases, related to drug cultivation and trafficking by the Kingdom of Morocco. I will end by saying that if the European Union was currently negotiating with the real owners of the Saharan shoals, the Saharan people, we would already have a valid agreement and we would not be being subjected to blackmail by the Alaouite Kingdom as a result of which failure to reach an agreement, or the sealing of an ineffective agreement, would have serious repercussions on the special relationship between Morocco and the European Union.

 Madam President, Commissioner, the Group of the Greens/European Free Alliance generally supports the report by the rapporteur, Mr Jové Peres. We are convinced that the Commission’s proposal is restrictive in budgetary terms, which would mean major financial cut-backs in the sector. It should be remembered that the fruit and vegetable sector is the first common organisation of the market to be financed by its own producers, so it is vitally important to encourage producer organisations and to support an increase in operational funds. It must be stressed that the fruit and vegetable sector represents a considerable percentage of final agricultural production in the European Union. Yet it only accounts for 4% of the EAGGF guarantee budget. It should also be remembered that there was broad consensus within the Committee on Agriculture and Rural Development when this report was approved. I must mention the predominantly Mediterranean nature of this type of production, which affects several Member States. It is a sector which directly and indirectly generates a vast number of jobs, resulting in highly dynamic economic activity. In general terms it is the main source of income for almost two million families in Europe. It must be stressed that producer organisations, which will be strengthened and encouraged by the amendment introduced by the Agriculture Committee, are extremely important for the rural development of certain districts. Fruit and vegetable production is closely linked to the Mediterranean culture and diet, the greatest exponent of a balanced, healthy diet for our consumers. Therefore, an objective that producer organisations must prioritise is the encouragement of quality production. The fruit and vegetable sector, however, faces an uncertain future due in part to the erosion of Community preference in the Euro-Mediterranean free trade area, which may wipe out all the work that has been done. We must therefore maintain a constructive and vigilant attitude for the future.

Madam President, I do not wish to be repetitive, but the situation requires it. You are aware of the situation in Campo de Gibraltar
, where there is a damaged British nuclear submarine. As we have feared and supposed since the start, according to the technicians, the significance of the damage is increasing daily with the passage of time. I ask you, Madam President, to do everything possible to speed up the procedure under way in the Committee on Petitions concerning a protest document that has been presented by more than thirty social groups and NGOs against this situation, in which there has been a blatant failure to comply with Community regulations on radiation protection.

 Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, no sportsman or woman takes drugs unless he or she has a financial interest in doing so. There is no doubt that doping is changing sport and that sport will be changed due to doping, which means it will become absolutely ludicrous if we do nothing to prevent it. The combination of enormous and disproportionate financial, media and sponsoring interests surrounding sportsmen and women puts so much pressure on them, and the intensity of sport is so great, that in order to maintain their level of competitiveness and the pace imposed on them by sporting calendars, sportsmen and women tend to use prohibited substances. Without limiting the length of competitions and without having obligatory rest time, it will be very difficult to eradicate doping. However, we should not forget that sportsmen and women are also human beings who can fall ill or injure themselves, and will therefore need drugs and additional help to combat the stress under which they place their bodies, which is why false positive tests are the order of the day and will brand the sportsman or woman concerned forever. What we need to do is to harmonise criteria, have a single list of prohibited substances, homogenise tests, have warnings on drugs and do more research. Ladies and gentlemen, we need to reinvent sport, because as it is at the moment there is a battle for glory, but also for money and sponsorship. In order for it not to disappear, we need to go back to the traditional values of sport, in which people compete for one reward only – a medal.

Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, as has been said, a British nuclear submarine has been moored at its Gibraltar base since 19 May. The smallest breakdown in the cooling system of a nuclear reactor can never be considered as insignificant, as it contains heavy water with radioactive isotopes. Moreover, the United Kingdom has knowingly failed to comply with Community regulations in terms of radiation protection, exposing its citizens in Gibraltar and those in Algeciras Bay to a very high probability of contamination, as it is now, and not last May, that it is recognising the extent of the breakdown. In this case, there has been a violation of Community law. We complained that Russia took four days to inform the European Community about its accident. We took two months. I suppose that the booing that we received from some British Members when we criticised the situation in this House was also directed at the citizens of Gibraltar. In this House we criticised the lack of information for the population in the area and of reliable and official news from the United Kingdom. In the same way, we criticise something which is a reality: the United Kingdom, faced with considerable social pressures in the country, has decided to transfer its base for nuclear submarine operations and repairs to Algeciras Bay, without respecting its own standards, which do not allow it to have this type of base in highly populated areas. Equally, we deplore the contemplative attitude of the Spanish Government, which only reacted when the pressure and concern reached a maximum. For the above reasons, those of us from Andalusia ask this Parliament, and its President, far beyond the bilateral diplomatic interests of the Member States, to carry out the appropriate consultations and negotiations to make it possible to immediately transfer this submarine to bases that have sufficient security conditions to repair it and thus to put an end to the public alarm that has been created.

Madam President, during the last Strasbourg part-session I communicated to the Presidency the enormous concern in the Bay of Algeciras and the Campo de Gibraltar
 about the presence of an English nuclear submarine suffering from a serious fault in the cooling system of its nuclear reactor. I am yet to receive any reply in this regard. Madam President, we Andalusians are proud to receive this broken-down vessel in our waters, but we are very concerned about the United Kingdom’s stubborn determination to repair the fault there. It is common knowledge, from the Royal Navy’s own documents, that this port is not sufficiently equipped for the repair of this type of fault. We would therefore ask for your help so that a section of the European Union’s population may be protected from any possible risk. To this end, I would ask you to take the necessary steps so that the said submarine may be towed away and repaired somewhere where there are sufficient safeguards, and so that we can thereby prevent the social alarm which is being caused.

Madam President, I would ask you to communicate to Mrs Fontaine, so that she may make the relevant representations to the competent institutions, the great concern in the Gulf of Algeciras about the presence, for more than two months now, of the British nuclear submarine, HMS Tireless, which has broken down, apparently with a very serious problem relating to its cooling system. According to the latest information, it appears that they intend to repair it there. The inhabitants of the area have expressed their complete opposition to its being repaired there, by means of a joint resolution of the political groups which has been approved today. From this House, we urgently request that the British Government immediately remove this machine from the bay and repair it in England, where we suppose that they will at least have the appropriate facilities to do so.

 Mr President, Commissioner, it is terrible and disappointing for mankind that every now and again we hear these cries of pain from Africa begging for food and water, in the 21st century. Why do we still allow this to happen? Do we not have a conscience? Every day the European Union provides less funding, less aid, in global terms, to the poor countries of Africa. So how can we be surprised at this situation? How can it be that we have warehouses full of surplus food which we are obliged to destroy when it rots away pointlessly or when it does not meet the conditions for consumption which we demand? There are reasons to justify this, but none of them justifies the death of a single person from starvation. It is not true that we show solidarity. No. All we do is try to put the fire out with occasional aid, without a clear or decisive policy for prevention although we know perfectly well that famine in Africa, and in the third world in general, happens periodically. I hope that these thousands of tonnes of food aid provided do not silence the media and that they continue to report on the tragedy in Africa. I am not saying anything new. It has been said a million times and it will be said again, but today I am speaking from the heart and I feel Africa’s pain as if it were my own. When will we have a Marshall Plan for Africa? To this end, I propose that there be set up a prestigious and independent committee of international experts to assess the situation together with the international organisations and to implement a series of urgent proposals and initiatives for food and health aid, acting immediately, planning for the future and putting all our humanitarian weaponry into the hands of the non-governmental organisations.

Mr President, enlargement is essential. It is genuinely important for the future of the European Union, as it is the only way to prevent Europe becoming an island of prosperity surrounded by poverty. However, if enlargement towards the East is inevitable, how can we explain that enlargement should only happen in one direction, taking us further away from the Mediterranean, which is so near by, forgetting how near the countries of the Maghreb are, some of which enjoy a special association status with the European Union, and that our future is intimately connected with theirs. This is no need to remind you of the important common interests we have with those countries in terms of agriculture and fishing, nor the serious shared problems relating to immigration between Andalusia and Morocco, which create added difficulties. European regions such as Andalusia, which are very close to the countries of the Maghreb, share more interests and problems with those countries than they do with other Member States of the Union, and far more than they do with the future candidates for enlargement. In fact, this love-hate situation between certain Community regions and the Maghreb creates unnecessary tensions, both economic and social, which we must resolve by putting all our powers of negotiation on the table and by using all the existing mechanisms, or new ones which should be created, in order to relaunch Euro-Mediterranean cooperation. In this respect, do the Council and the Commission believe that the creation of an inter-regional body or council for the Straits of Gibraltar, consisting of political representatives of the bordering countries and the European Union itself, could be useful and allow for the decentralisation of cooperation?

Mr President, I did not want to speak earlier in order not to interfere in the debate. I simply wanted to express my total disagreement with the previous President chairing this sitting with regard to speaking time, since he has not respected the time allocated to the Groups and the time which is, of course, distributed amongst the MEPs. The previous President has clearly discriminated in favour of other MEPs who have been allowed to speak longer than they should have done. Once we take our places, all MEPs are equal and all of us have to respect the Rules. Therefore, although this humble MEP does not represent a multinational lobby, he asks that the time allocated to his group be respected.

 Mr President, Commissioner, Andalusia is one of the most tolerant and multiracial regions of the European Union. Since time immemorial it has welcomed all those who have decided to move there and regarded them as Andalusians from day one, whether or not they were born in our region. Therefore, as an MEP, but primarily as an Andalusian, I can feel only sadness, repugnance and condemnation for the xenophobic and racist events which have occurred and which are foreign to this tolerant community. Yet a worrying situation is apparent. All decisions which are or are not taken and all agreements which are or are not negotiated by the Community institutions with regard to the economy of the principal sectors in disadvantaged areas like Andalusia may indirectly lead to these serious incidents. I am referring, for example, to the lack of agreement with Morocco and to the lack of solutions for the fishing industry, part of whose fleet is moored in Almería. I am also referring to the erratic management of the import scheme for fruit and vegetables by the EU which is dominating relations between Almería and Morocco. I am also referring to the immigration policy of the regions, Member States and European Union which, due to actions or omissions, is leading to a few territories like Almería having to support this migratory pressure from north-west Africa on their own. All these factors have unfortunately been accumulating over time and are now allowing those who are cruel, intolerant, racist and destructive, of which all our countries have some examples, but thankfully a minority, to light the fuse of xenophobia. Anyone, whether European or not, who lives and works in Andalusia, is an Andalusian and deserves our consideration and respect. The EU can and must speak out. For you, the south is Andalusia but for us Andalusians it is Africa. We must therefore ensure that the EU provides every possible resource so that the economy of the south can prosper and enable a society to develop with more tolerance and respect for one another. This has not been achieved with the solutions proposed to date which have quite simply been based on looking the other way.

Commissioner, as a doctor specialising in sports medicine, the issue of drug taking worries me enormously. But I would like to ask you one thing. Is the Commission aware of the powerful influence of the links between sport, the media and those with large financial and advertising interests, which induce elite sportsmen to use drugs? Has the Commission established, with the International Olympic Committee, a timetable with regard to the issue of drug taking in sport?
