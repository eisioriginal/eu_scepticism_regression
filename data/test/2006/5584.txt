Madam President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, first of all I should like to state that I fully agree with what Mr Mitchell said in his speech. We are not on schedule; we are not up to speed. Nonetheless I would point out to him that it is important not to make the same mistake regarding the French President that the French sometimes make regarding Mr Brown. Speeches about action do not guarantee that the action will be effective. In terms of the crisis itself, it is clear that, for us, the crisis did not start with finance. It is rooted in the social and environmental spheres. That being said, it combines with the financial cycle, that is to say that, when the cycle is going well, we take risks, but when it is no longer going well, we tell ourselves that it might be wise to regulate things slightly. We are at the stage where regulation – and strong regulation at that – is required. Regulation at single market level is required, that is to say that we need far more centralised regulation at European level. This is what guides us in our choice of votes. We fully support the Gauzès report and the progress it makes. For years now we have been calling for more centralised regulation and supervision at European level, and the first stage that has been achieved with the CESR is in our view entirely appropriate. However, despite Mr Skinner’s efforts – and, on this point, our criticism is exactly the same as Mr Mitchell’s – we regret that the governments have not understood. We do not agree with the compromise that is proposed and that rejects the system of group supervision. I believe that such a method will lead to further disasters. We shall therefore vote against the Skinner report – not against the work of Mr Skinner himself, but against the compromise imposed by the governments.

Mr President, Commissioner, this is the second time that we have had to increase the guarantee provided by the European Union to overcome the difficulties of its members, non-members of the euro zone. This is the second time: we already increased it in December. Mr McCreevy has congratulated us on the promptness of our action. We already acted promptly in December, and we should like to say to Mr McCreevy, as Mrs Berès did a moment ago, that the lift … Yes, Mr McCreevy, please? Please? Commissioner … ... We should like reciprocity to be applied, by which I mean that, when Parliament asks you to submit a draft on the regulation of hedge funds, you respond to us immediately, and in the same timeframe that we apply when you ask us to increase aid for the protection of the balances of payments. We are indeed in a crisis; we may not need to sit every day, but at least let us not have to wait six months from the European Parliament’s requesting a directive on hedge funds to the Commission complying! Clearly, then, as far as this aid is concerned, we fully agree on the need to increase this credit line, and I am slightly surprised by Mr Becsey’s remarks. We had exactly the same discussion in December. Commissioner Almunia explained to Mr Becsey that it was the Hungarian Government itself that had requested aid from the IMF, but not from the European Union, and that it was the European Union that said: ‘But we too can help you’. It is quite clear that the European Union has a duty to show solidarity towards countries outside the euro zone, but there is also no reason why IMF aid, to which each of us, Hungary and Romania included, contribute, should be turned down. Thus, in the Berès report – which we shall, in any case, vote for – there are two things that bother us. Firstly, what is the point of saying in paragraph 4 that we must commit ourselves to inter-country solidarity only to then point out in paragraph 11 that under no circumstances are we bound by a country’s commitments? It is true that we are not bound by a country’s commitments, but there is no use in pointing this out when we say that we will show solidarity with one another. The second problem is the assertion that there is no legal basis to increase this solidarity, but it is precisely the responsibility of the Commission to provide this legal basis. We are in a crisis, and it is high time we were given a legal basis.

Madam President, this is a purely technical amendment. There is a misprint in our amendment. There is an indent that was worded as follows: ‘intensify the elimination of barriers’. We have replaced this with ‘remove unjustified barriers’, but, unfortunately, the old paragraph, the old indent has remained in the wording of the amendment. It is therefore the third indent that we have amended slightly, and there is no need to keep the old version.

Madam President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, since this is one of the last chances we will have for doing so, I should like, first of all, to thank Mr Kovács for the efforts, often disappointing, that he has made over a number of years here, in a situation where taxation is subject to the rule of unanimity, and thus subject to veto by the various Member States. His task has been very difficult and he may feel not much has been achieved. I hope with all my heart that his crowning achievement, this directive, will go through with solid support from Parliament. The proof of the excellence of his work is that, when we wanted to improve on it in the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs, we were unable to do so. Some people were pulling in one direction, others in another. Each side was convinced we could do better. We managed to put through some of the better amendments, or so we thought, and then when we voted on the whole text, we realised that it was not going to work. In the end, the group’s coordinators reached the consensus that Mr Kovács had probably struck the right balance. Therefore, the Group of the Greens/European Free Alliance, like the other two groups that have just spoken, will not be tabling any amendments. You have struck the right balance and it is an intelligent one. Some countries, today, faced with the crisis, are reducing all their VAT rates. I am convinced that this is a mistake. Member States need financial resources and this is not the time to go deeper into deficit in that way, even if you are doing so to stimulate the economy by encouraging spending. Another reason is that trying to reduce prices by playing around with VAT leads to very high real rates at a time when the Central Bank is trying to lower them. You are proposing another strategy and you are right: using VAT to make targeted reductions or targeted changes in relative prices. These are the right choices, according to two criteria. Firstly, subsidiarity. In other words, you are targeting immobile products: local services and construction. Your second criterion for targeting is labour-intensive services. As environmentalists, we would have liked you to target the green revolution specifically: the sectors that are necessary if we are to emerge from the current crisis, which is the result of the industrial, liberal and productivist model that has dominated the world for more than 30 years. We would have liked you to extend the reduced VAT rates to all goods covered by the Kyoto Protocol. In practical terms, if we combine locally supplied with labour-intensive services, then this would mean that all the construction, all the insulation, and all the development of energy efficient buildings could be covered in the directive, and that is good enough for us. I should like to say straightaway that we shall obviously not be voting in favour of Mrs Lulling’s argument. Of course, it is diabolical to persist in error, but I think this saying could equally apply to Mrs Lulling herself. We could also talk about Mandeville and private vice for public virtue. We shall not encourage private vice through public vice and we will defend those countries that try to limit alcohol consumption.

 Mr President, Mr Giscard d’Estaing, Mr Juncker, Mr Trichet, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, I would like to remind you how, in 1992, when it was still completely dubious as to whether the French would vote in favour of the Maastricht Treaty, Jacques Delors spoke to the general assembly of the French Green Party, which managed to deliver the missing 1% or 2%. He said to us: ‘Vote for the euro, then we will have a political Europe, because if we do not create a political Europe to control Europe, the people will not accept it; they will never accept it.’ He did not persuade us. The Maastricht Treaty was approved, but no political Europe was created. This is the very problem which we are facing today. Why were we against the euro at that time? There were basically two reasons for it. Firstly, it seemed to us that the Maastricht criteria were going to drag Europe into at least five years of pro-cyclical recessionary policy and, secondly, the way in which the monetary policy was incorporated into the general economic policy by the Maastricht Treaty was not satisfactory. For the sake of the European Central Bank’s independence, we would separate monetary policy from the rest of the policies. I must say quite honestly that, even if I am still not convinced by the Maastricht Treaty today, like all the other Greens, I am rather attracted by the changes which the legislation and application of Economic and Monetary Union have undergone. Three major changes have taken place. Firstly, price stability has been established at a level of slightly less than, but close to, 2%. This target may seem a bit absurd. At the moment, when the world is being threatened by deflation and the situation is being aggravated by the tendency of some countries to hastily cut their VAT rate as part of a Keynesian policy, it is obvious that setting this target of 2% is no longer just for show. If we fail to keep to this 2% target we run the risk of having very high real interest rates being forced on us. The second major reform is obviously the reform of the Stability and Growth Pact carried out in 2005, which allows us today to have a policy that is contracyclical and aimed at countering the crisis. The third major transformation is the change to how things work in practice. This permanent dialogue, as highlighted once again in this Chamber, between Mr Trichet, Mr Almunia, Mr Juncker and Mr Barroso, is, strictly speaking, contrary to the Maastricht Treaty itself. I regard this form of cooperation between Mr Trichet and Mr Almunia, for example, to be the equivalent of that between Mr Bernanke and Mr Paulson, which is a positive and desirable development. What remains to be done then? All I would say is that we need to apply properly the good aspects of the Maastricht Treaty. We have a real problem in defining the exchange rate, which has been mentioned on several occasions by my predecessors. The task of setting the exchange rate is assigned to the Council. We must find the means to ensure that the Council sets an exchange rate for Europe which does not derive randomly from the interest rate chosen by the European Central Bank, but properly reflects an industrial policy. We must find the proper instruments to do this. Secondly, the European Central Bank’s objective is not only to maintain a rate close to 2% but also to apply Europe’s policy, by that I mean the Lisbon and Gothenburg Strategies. We need to have a policy for refinancing and rediscounting private debts by the European Central Bank according to the Gothenburg and Lisbon Strategies. Lastly, as has already been mentioned, there needs to be supervision at a European level and the European Central Bank is in the best position to perform this function.

 Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs went to Paris to examine all these directives. We also met with both trade unions and electricity transmission system operators. Everyone has campaigned for a stronger agency than the one proposed by the Commission. We are familiar with the case law of the Court of Justice and we are fully aware of the fact that the Commission was proposing not to change the Treaty in order to avoid creating difficulties. That is why in its opinion, the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs recommends strengthening everything to do with monitoring, recommendations and suspensive power, but advises against giving the agency the power of administrative policing that goes as far as imposing fines. Only the Commission has this administrative policing power. I believe that in this respect, we can take account of the Treaties in their current state and also the needs for market regulation.

 Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, I hope not to overrun my time any more than Mr Klinz overran his. I am not going to talk again about the great success of the euro, both as an institution and as an instrument for stabilising inflation. However, I would like to thank you, Commissioner, and also thank the Commission, for finally having lifted a taboo. After ten years, it is high time that we looked at the aspects that have not worked. What has not worked, as you have said, is that the growth promised by the euro has not materialised. Worse still, the European Union Member States not in the euro zone have experienced higher growth than those in it. There is therefore a genuine problem with the way in which the euro was constructed with the Maastricht agreement, and we need to address this. There are three points as far as I can see. The first, which you highlighted, is the need to reform the governance of the euro, with coordination between budgetary policy and monetary policy. It is clear – and I differ from Mrs Berès on this point – that we cannot simultaneously ask for greater coordination between the two and say that the European Central Bank must remain totally independent. Alternatively, this could mean that budgetary policy in turn – and that means the Ecofin Council – should itself become an independent institution that is no longer democratically accountable. That would be completely unacceptable. We therefore need to define the word ‘independent’. Independent from what? From private interests, yes; from national interests, yes; but not from the EU’s budgetary and general economic policy. The second problem is that Maastricht gave the Council responsibility for exchange rate policy, although the weapon of exchange rate policy is the interest rate, and the interest rate is controlled by the European Central Bank. It therefore needs to be very clearly stated that, when it comes to exchange rates, the European Central Bank must subordinate its interest rate to the exchange rate policy defined by the Council. The third point is that on the basis of the subprime crisis, we have learned that it is necessary to distinguish between several types of loan. However, this was not in the Treaty of Maastricht. I believe it needs to be very clearly stated that the loans required for sustainable development and for real action to combat climate change must be issued at very low interest rates.

 Madam President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, this is quite an important report just before the Bali Conference. We are aware that international trade is developing at twice the speed of gross world product. This means it is causing growth in the transport industry, one of the most prolific producers of greenhouse gases. It is also enabling the relocation of production, which can be good in terms of using workforces and applying wage regulations, but, given that it takes no account whatsoever of the cost of greenhouse gases produced by this division of labour, it may accelerate the production of greenhouse gases and climate change. To give you just one set of figures: ships, which carry 40 times more freight than planes, produce only twice as much greenhouse gas, but we still use planes to transport our goods to optimise the production cycle. I therefore feel that, further to the Stern Report and the four reports by the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change, we should be aware that it is worth waiting half a day or even three more days for a product to arrive at its destination, rather than destroying our climate at a price the Stern Report estimates as 5 000 billion dollars. Beyond this comment, the report makes an attempt to open up certain avenues. Obviously there are certain avenues relating to transport. We are pleased with the recent vote on the addition of the aviation industry to the European quota system. The report encourages reflection on industrial organisation to reduce the geographic scale of production chains – producing in closer proximity to the end user – and makes a number of proposals in relation to trade in environmental commodities. What we are proposing, within the context of the WTO and the bilateral or bi-regional agreements – in other words, all the agreements we are currently negotiating – is to prioritise the assessment of the effects on climate change within the assessment made by these agreements of the environmental effects. We also suggest prioritising a considerable reduction in all tariff and non-tariff barriers – and here we are thinking about royalties in particular – that hinder trade in own goods and services which are the ones that can reduce the production of greenhouse gases. All this must evidently be carried out within the most multilateral context, with the WTO if possible, in the absence of any bi-regional agreements currently being negotiated by Europe. We cannot, however, rule out the possibility that, after 2012, in the initial post-Kyoto phase, mankind will not have reached a unanimous agreement on the fight against climate change. In this case, Europe’s decision to lead the fight against climate change will definitely hit some of its sectors. It will not hit all of them. In many cases, being the leader of the fight against climate change provides a competitive edge. In some cases, and here I am thinking specifically of the cement industry, this could pose enormous problems and could even lead to cement tourism. In that case, when all the possibilities of multilateral agreements have been exhausted, we suggest adopting the GATT’s Article 20, in other words, border adjustment taxes to restore fair competition. This, ladies and gentlemen, forms the basis of my proposals.

 I am speaking as Chairman of the Delegation for relations with the countries of the Andean Community. As such, I have been visiting Venezuela one or more times a year. Since I started going to this country, in other words since the military coup against President Chávez, I have been hearing the Venezuelan media screaming against the President, against the dictatorship. In the hotels I used, even though they had three, four or even five stars, you were not allowed to watch public television, and anyway it is not always possible to do so as it is normally broadcast in a snowy format. The generals behind the coup still stroll around the largest square in Caracas and President Chávez, legally elected, re-elected and re-elected again, has never lifted a finger against them. Venezuela is one of the countries trying to deal, as peacefully as possible, with the conflicts which are commonplace all over Latin America. I am not wholly enamoured with all the changes that President Chávez has tried to make to the Bolivarian Constitution. Having said that, as Mr Matsakis stated, it is the people of Venezuela who will decide. We can certainly make excuses for the way in which we gave the impression that we supported the military coup. It is true that this has helped radicalise the regime in Venezuela. I feel, however, that, first and foremost and above all, we ought to respect the decision of the Venezuelan people.

 Mr President, Commissioner, rapporteur, I would first like to offer my warmest thanks to the Commission for having dared to break the aviation taboo, without waiting for the IATA decisions, and I congratulate the rapporteur for having supported this. As draftsman for the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs, I will concentrate on just one point: the issue of competition. You mentioned, Commissioner, that this directive removes an error in the regulations that favours other modes of transport over aviation. That is an excellent point. It should not be the case that the way it is applied ends up favouring certain companies over others. Practically every one of us has, at least once this year, flown with an airline that did not exist three years ago. We cannot therefore guarantee an income to the existing companies. The greater the share allocated for distribution by auction, the better the competition will be.

 Mr President, President-in-Office of the Council, Commissioner, I think we should not beat about the bush. The problem is not the respect that we owe this great country, Brazil, the problem is the turn that international relations are now taking. Mr Mandelson and, it seems, the Directorate-General for Trade have abandoned the ideal of multilateralism and are embracing the bilateralist approach of the United States. What used to be the trademark European position in international trade was that we at least wanted bi-regionalism; in other words, to discuss things region to region. Well, we were told, we are in talks with Brazil, and we are in talks with India: as if we needed to compensate in some way for the memory of British imperialism by the memory of Portuguese or Spanish imperialism! India is two and a half times the size of Europe, including Turkey. India is three times the size of Latin America. Our aim is to help create a multipolar world. This means that first of all, we must help with the unification of Mercosur and the Andean Community, and then the unification of the entire South American Community of Nations. In this respect, we have nothing against discussions, whether with Bolivia or Brazil, but we must bear in mind that we should be seeking to unite and not divide. We must put Mercosur before Brazil in our list of priorities and, when we hold talks with Brazil, we must consider the consequences that this could have, including for our discussions with ASEAN on sugar.
 Alain Lipietz,

 Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, the crisis demands that I highlight three points. First, it comes from a hardship crisis among North American national officials. It should be understood that all US officials have very serious deficits, described by what we call the US twin deficits. We have had this crisis, we will have others, either from large US companies, US states or even perhaps from the Federal Government. We should expect some more very serious crises to come from the United States over the coming years. Second, this crisis happened in the United States in March. It spread throughout the world through hedge funds, the first two of which failed in June. It only affected European banks in late July, early August. We did have time to realise that the flames were spreading. Mrs Merkel, our President-in-Office at the time of the G8, told us to take measures concerning hedge funds, and nobody listened to her. Worse still, the Netherlands are in the process of developing a policy to deregulate the establishment of hedge funds within the country. At the same time as it is speaking against hedge funds, the European Union is encouraging their development in its own territory. This shows a genuine failure of attempts by the European Union to impose supervisory measures and prudential rules upon itself. As a former rapporteur in favour of prudential rules and supervision of financial conglomerates, I experience this as a personal failure. I recall that we needed more than one parliamentary term to write the simplified prospectus on issuing securities in Europe. Today, one bank is not capable of reading the complex prospectus that another bank publishes on the content of the funds it is selling. That is what it has come to. The third problem, as I told the Central Bank years ago, is that you cannot regulate the monetary system solely with measures aimed at the lending rate. I think the crisis in Europe was precipitated by the increase in the European Central Bank’s interest rate at the end of the last quarter. I do not think it is enough to say you should reduce the rate by 0.5% or keep the same rate or increase it by 0.5%. We have a genuine problem to sort out, which is the reintroduction of a selective policy for lending, so that the interest rate can be set at 0% for necessary investments such as fighting climate change and can be much more expensive for lending directed at speculation.

Mr President, I should like to begin by saying to Mr Juncker that he should not take offence at the small number of us in this House. I myself would have willingly stayed in my office to have the pleasure of seeing him close-up on my television screen. The debating conditions in this room are rather difficult. I should like, first and foremost, to express my emotion at seeing just how in line the Mitchell report is with the debates that the entire Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs has been holding for several years now. For the first time we have a relatively unanimous report, which will enable us to reach agreements on points that used to divide us. Firstly, there is the idea that structural reforms can be implemented and can increase the potential growth rate compared with that which we had in the 1990s, and that they may perhaps have already increased it. Secondly, there is what is, in short, the explicit affirmation that the labour market reforms do not relate to an unconditional wage moderation, but rather, as Mr Juncker said, to a moderation qualified by means of proportionality with productivity growth and that this growth is being created by means of improved human capital, training and research, and not by means of a reduction in social guarantees. The third major advance of Mr Mitchell’s report is that the issue of paragraph 111 of the Treaty has at last been properly addressed. It is the responsibility of the Council to set exchange-rate policy. I would say to Mr Juncker that he should also listen to what Mr Gallois says about the competitiveness of Airbus. One cannot say that there is one country in particular that has difficulty in adapting to the current exchange rates. In paragraph 10 of the resolution by Mr Mitchell, we call on Mr Juncker to agree with Mr Almunia, and this should be welcomed.

 Mr President, it gives us great pleasure to examine once again this annual report, which our committee had little difficulty in adopting unanimously this year. All the major groups voted for it. The rapporteur, Mr Montoro Romero proved open to all suggestions, including ours. This unanimity in our committee is a clear illustration of Parliament’s complete satisfaction with the European Investment Bank’s (EIB’s) attitude to us since 1999, when I had the honour of being Parliament’s first rapporteur on the Bank’s activities. It might be said that we have succeeded in establishing permanent links between our two institutions and in ensuring a symbiotic relationship between, on the one hand, the wishes of the MEPs, who often pass on requests from associations and NGOs, and, on the other, the policies of the EIB, which, on the basis of our recommendations, has increasingly come into line with the Gothenberg-Lisbon Strategy. This year, as well as noting that the objectives have in the main been met by the EIB, I should simply like to draw attention to the difficulties that we cause the Bank via our demands. Mention has just been made of the Baltic oil pipeline. It is true that as soon as we demand the highest security when it comes to sustainable development, decisions need to be made on our objectives. There is another, more complex, problem. We ask the Bank to lend more to SMEs; in other words, we ask it to find operational provisions enabling small businesses and relay banks to implement the objectives that we set for the Bank.

 Madam President, I feel that, in some respects, we have a strong agreement on the structural nature of energy price increases. In this regard, I welcome the contribution of the Committee on Industry, Research and Energy, which expressed its opinion extremely clearly and supported the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs. Where we disagree, including in the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs, is on the speculative aspect that has been added to this Structural Fund. From that point of view, I very much endorse the words of Mrs Budreikaitė, and hope that she can persuade her group to withdraw the amendment disputing the speculative element on the volatility of the price of energy. We need to take measures to combat volatility. We must at least eliminate the speculative element of movements in the price of energy, and are capable of so doing. That being said, we must be aware of the particularly serious impact of the structural rise in the price of oil. A grass is invading the planet, namely the African palm, a cereal crop used in biofuel or biodiesel production, which will lead to the price of food being linked to the price of energy. This is an unacceptable risk that we cannot afford to run. For years we have been wondering how to ensure that workers do not suffer from the second wave of the effects of oil on the cost of living. If, by dint of an extraordinary misfortune, the policy of developing biofuels were to lead to competition with food production policy, the result would certainly be a link between the price of food and the price of energy, and that would be the most terrible disaster.

Madam President, Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I very much appreciated the content of President Barroso’s speech. I appreciated the intention he announced to present one or more legislative drafts – I shall return to the question of one or more in a moment – for adoption by codecision as well as the four principles he invoked. I believe it was important to reiterate those principles. The Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs rejected our proposal for a simple reference to the substance of Article 122 of the Constitutional Treaty and, what is worse, for a simple reference to Article 86 of the present Treaty. The latter article, as you pointed out, specifies that, in the event of a conflict between the market and public-service requirements in law or in practice, the public service must take precedence. I believe it is extremely important that the parliamentary draft reaffirms what we adopted at the time of the Constitutional Treaty, namely the text of Article 122, and confirms that at least we still believe in Article 86 of the present Treaty. What we would like is to go much further in pinning down the precise implications of our forthcoming vote. If there is one point on which I agree with Mrs in't Veld, it is that Mr Rapkay’s diplomatic and very judiciously calculated statement about the need to legislate can be equally easily interpreted to mean one thing or the other. We will therefore ask you, in accordance with both the Treaty of Amsterdam and the interinstitutional agreement, to present us with a draft directive by virtue of the right of legislative initiative vested in this Parliament. We are also entirely in agreement with the four principles you outlined to us. If we disagree with Mrs in't Veld, the precise bone of contention is subsidiarity. I regard it as a grave misjudgement to talk of strict subsidiarity when the Services Directive is actually the applicable instrument in the absence of a specific directive on services of general interest. The fact is that we have watched the substance and scope of the Services Directive vary incessantly from day to day and from week to week. At one point, subsidised housing was included. Then it was almost excluded, only to be reinstated again, though not fully. We need only compare our parliamentary draft with those of the Commission and the Council to see the lack of agreement on the public services that fall within the ambit of the Services Directive. We need to legislate today to set these matters straight.

Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, we have to examine a report that, for the first time ever, is taking on a political dimension. In the 2005 referenda debates on the ratification of the Constitutional Treaty, the notions of an area of free and open competition – as it is currently referred to – or undistorted competition – as it would have been referred to if the treaty on the European Constitution had been adopted – were at the centre of the debate. Our problem is to prove now that competition policy can serve the people, that it must serve the people and that it already serves the people. There is broad consensus on this point within our committee but, from the moment when I, as rapporteur, had to highlight obvious cases that required a reassessment or a reorientation of competition policy or that, on the contrary, called for competition policy strongly to be encouraged, disagreements arose. In its current, post-amendment, state, the report is characteristic of the European Parliament’s reports, which practically no one can, or wants to, read because they say absolutely nothing at all. I hope that, on at least three points, forceful ideas are reaffirmed in order to show the people that the European institutions are there to serve them. Competition policy is divided into three broad areas: the fight against the formation of monopolies, the fight against cartels and the fight against State aid that is illicit or harmful to healthy and undistorted competition. I will take these three examples and I will propose forceful ideas to you on these policies, ladies and gentlemen. Firstly, the fight against monopolies: the European Union’s policy has been admirable in its struggle against Microsoft’s abuse of its dominant position. My committee, the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs, chose not to support the Directorate-General for Competition in this fight. I call on you, ladies and gentlemen, to reaffirm the European Parliament’s support for the Directorate-General for Competition and for the Commission in the trial of strength they are conducting in relation to Microsoft. Secondly, I will address the formation of these monopolies and the fight against cartels. Overall, the Directorate-General for Competition has behaved admirably. I am thinking, in particular, of the Vivendi/Hachette affair. I believe that, in an attempt to do things too quickly, mistakes were inadvertently made in 1999 during the merger between Rhône-Poulenc and Hoechst. We need to try to understand how these mistakes came about. We do not have the right to cancel the measures taken by the Commission, and I do not want this, but I am calling for a committee of inquiry to investigate what happened in order to understand how tens of thousands of employees and tens of thousands of small shareholders came to be ruined due to the Commission’s failure to carry out checks, despite the fact that it had committed itself to doing this. The third point on which I am calling on you to intervene and to voice forceful ideas concerns the field of public aid. The Directorate-General for Competition and the 2004 report approve of this aid when it is consistent with the Gothenburg policy and the Lisbon policy. We must support the Directorate-General for Competition on this point. When, however, the Directorate-General for Competition supports the town of Charleroi’s giving generous subsidies to the airline Ryanair, I believe that it must be criticised because that kind of action distorts competition between towns, between businesses and between modes of transport in a way that is detrimental to the Lisbon and Gothenburg policies.

 Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, if there is one point on which I agree with the rapporteur, Mr Karas, it is that the proposed reform of the Stability and Growth Pact is still a very long way from giving Europe the capacity for economic governance that would allow it to satisfy all its citizens, both of this generation and those to come. We are still a long way from the situation in the United States, a much more integrated federation than our own, where there is a significant federal budget, where there are rules for coordinating the budgets of the federal states, where budgetary policy and monetary policy are closely coordinated by Congress, where Congress is able to influence the options taken by the Chairman of the Federal Reserve and where the Federal Reserve’s objectives are wider than mere price stability. Having said that, I believe that Commissioner Almunia’s proposals, from the previous term of office to their adoption by the Council in a more improved version, are an extremely positive step, and our Group will oppose the calls – from the Group of the European People’s Party (Christian Democrats) and European Democrats in particular – for backtracking to what the former Commission President called a more stupid pact. We think we have taken a significant step towards an intelligent pact. If we may still make a contribution, simply by way of clarification, we suggest, in one of our amendments, both including education expenditure alongside research expenditure among the relevant factors that might justify an increase in the deficit, and making explicit mention of expenditure for the stability of the world’s ecological balance among the Union’s objectives. By this we mean expenditure for the implementation of the Kyoto Agreement.

 Mr President, I am standing in for my colleague, Mrs Flautre, with whom I have been following this matter for five years. I think that Mr Désir’s speech set out the real problem. I said to former Commissioner Monti years ago that the day would come when the Competition Directorate-General’s main task would be not so much to refuse aid as to see whether that aid was properly used. What authorises a country to award State aid in apparent violation of Article 87 of the Treaty? It is the fact that Europe considers it to be in its interest because, if this aid were refused, jobs would be lost that could not be replaced. A source of expertise, and of work in the interests of the EU’s objectives, of its citizens and of its consumers would disappear. In their great wisdom, the Competition DG and the Commission granted this aid to Alstom a year ago. It was not a case of bowing to pressure from the French Government. It was a case of expressing an opinion on the fact that, in the condition in which Alstom was proposing to continue, yes, it was worthwhile for a state to grant it aid. It was good for the whole of Europe. Well, if this assessment was right a year ago, it is right today. However, Alstom is in the process of proving that, when it asked for this State aid, it was not trying at all to maintain the supply of clean technologies in Europe, it was not trying to contribute to the objective of full employment in Europe. It was simply trying to obtain State aid according to the principle of the privatisation of profit and the nationalisation of loss. This is something that neither the left nor the right in Europe can accept. I therefore believe that we have here a key example on which the Commission should base its policy. If the fairly extensive list of authorisations for granting State aid – there are a dozen cases in Article 87, which is also retained in the Constitution – really forms the basis, so to speak, of industrial policy in Europe, this is the time to prove it. The Commission must say whether the aid granted a year ago simply served to bail out the Alstom group’s shareholders or whether it really served the interests of the people of Europe, their future, and in particular compliance with the Kyoto Protocol.

 Mr President, it is exactly five years since the European Parliament began its dialogue with the European Investment Bank in an own-initiative report. I was already your rapporteur five years ago and I can therefore bear witness to the extraordinary progress those five years have seen in the quality of the dialogue between the European Investment Bank and the European Parliament, in the quality of that dialogue with civil society and in the matching of the European Investment Bank’s policy with the tasks assigned to it since the European Union was formed. I would therefore like to begin by expressing the heartfelt gratitude of all of us who were already present during the last legislative period and, I hope, of all who will now be taking an interest in the European Investment Bank’s work and its contribution to the implementation of European policy. Warm congratulations and thanks, too, to the EIB’s directors with whom we maintained this dialogue. It has been a demanding dialogue, a rich dialogue, with genuine interaction on both sides. We have changed our perception of the EIB and the EIB has changed its own perception of its responsibilities. I would therefore like to take advantage of the few minutes allotted to me to sum up the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs’ unanimous report and underline the five most salient points of our report, in questioning terms of course. Firstly, we can no longer be content with talking about Lisbon and Gothenburg, we now need to try to make progress in clarifying the objectives. The EIB recognises that it exists to assist European Union policy; it needs to adopt criteria, quantitative indicators, in dialogue with Parliament. Secondly, we in the European Parliament were among those calling most strongly for the European Investment Bank to make loans to small and medium-sized businesses. However, that can only be done by means of global loans, which are made to banks, and the banks distribute the credits. In this case, we risk losing the ability to check that these loans are consistent with European Union objectives and we need to find a way of checking where these global loans have gone, ex post facto
 obviously. Thirdly, it has to be possible to extend this microcredit policy to an area that is very important in a society that is both a knowledge-based economy and also an ageing economy. I am speaking of third-sector enterprises that provide assistance to individuals and families. The fourth problem is that a potential conflict emerged during the hearing we held. The European Investment Bank is making a lot of effort to offer cheap long-term loans to local and regional authorities. Attractive as these loans are, however, they obviously come up against the limits imposed by the Stability and Growth Pact. The tendency to get around that difficulty by making loans to private businesses guaranteed by the State obviously introduces an ‘off-balance sheet’ risk. We suggest that the European Investment Bank should emulate the European Central Bank in adopting rules of ethics. Finally, my last point: in the first version of my report we noted the criticism voiced in certain sections of the press, mainly outside the European Union as it happens, regarding possible conflicts of interest involving senior EIB management staff because of their past activities at the head of large private undertakings that might benefit from EIB loans. Since then, the EIB has sent us a whole series of new internal codes designed to avoid such conflicts of interest or at any rate to take account of them by dealing with them before they arise. I have therefore tabled an amendment which I believe has been taken up by all group coordinators or shadow rapporteurs, thanking the European Investment Bank and noting the details it has provided following our vote in the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs.

 Mr President, concerning this problem, I tabled an amendment referring to 'public authority provide'. I notice that other amendments - in particular Amendment 3 by the PSE Group - make a distinction between 'run' and 'monitor'. In my intention, 'provide' is a verb 'monitor' or 'run'. So I put an oral amendment to all the amendments referring to the tendering process. Where Amendment 29 by the Green Group, Amendments 32, 33 and 27 state 'to provide' a public service. It should read 'to provide (run or monitor)'. Provide is to run or monitor.

 Commissioner, Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, how do we stand in terms of promoting peace in Colombia? The previous legislature had criticised what was known as the ‘Colombia Plan’ and had proposed far-reaching social reforms. The Commission, the Council and Parliament had declared themselves ready to play the role of facilitators in the negotiations, initiated by President Pastrana, between the government and the guerrillas. The obstacles faced by this declaration were, firstly, the abandonment of this policy by the Colombian authorities and, secondly, the FARC’s scandalous practice of taking hostages, illustrated by the case of Ingrid Betancourt. The field has therefore been abandoned to the extremists on both sides: on the one hand, the FARC and, on the other hand, President Uribe’s administration which, by proposing to put civilians into uniform and to accord immunity and funding to the paramilitaries, has dangerously jeopardised the constitutional state. What, then, is to be done? There is only one solution left to us: to support civil society’s efforts to promote peace, as expressed for example through the Civil Society Permanent Assembly for Peace. Let us remember that this form of coordination had resulted in the collection of ten million signatures for peace. The Assembly now proposes a broad humanitarian agreement involving, for example, exchanges of prisoners but, above all, respect by the two sides for international humanitarian law. From this point of view, I approve the statement by Commissioner Ferrero-Waldner. We call upon the Colombian Government to respect the constitutional state and humanitarian law. We expect the guerrillas to release the hostages as a sign of their desire to return to the negotiating table. We shall fund the peace laboratories and the support for civil society in Colombia. The best way in which Europe can help promote peace in Colombia is to support initiatives of this type and the local authorities in Colombia that follow these up.

It is clear that the amendments voted for or rejected have completely reversed the meaning of my report, since our Parliament believes it is not desirable for living beings to appear on the future notes of the European Union, that our difficulties are caused by excessively short working times in Europe and that, contrary to Article 2 of the Treaty, the Central Bank need not concern itself with sustainable growth. I would therefore urge that you vote ‘no’ to this report and if it is, unfortunately, adopted, which would send an immense signal about the future of Europe, I wish my name to be removed from the text.

 Mr President, Mr President of the European Central Bank (ECB), ladies and gentlemen, I should like to salute the high quality and, on certain points, the innovative nature of the ECB’s report for 2003, presented under Mr Trichet’s guidance. A period such as 2003 can be analysed from two perspectives: what exactly happened in 2003 and what was decided in 2003. These are two distinct notions, because, according to econometrics, monetary decisions have a delayed reaction on actual developments of something in the region of 12 to 18 months. What we are therefore discussing here today is, in some respects, the policy of 2002 and its orientations in 2003. Firstly, 2003 saw strong price stability: a little over 2% at the beginning of the year and actually a little less at the end of the year, despite oil price rises. Unfortunately, 2003 also saw a major slowdown in the EU in relation to its major competitors – the United States, Japan and China, among others. It is therefore with this information in mind that we must analyse the orientations given in 2003 by the ECB, which were both practical and doctrinal. Let us begin with the practical orientations: throughout 2002, in contrast with the policy pursued by our neighbours, the Bank of England itself or the US federal reserve, which cut their interest rates sharply, the ECB retained the same interest rate virtually until December. From December 2002 and throughout, let us say, the first half of 2003, there was a very sharp interest rate reduction in Europe, and we have begun to see the positive effects of this in 2004. This interest rate reduction was illustrated by what we call the ‘8 May Announcement’, which was dissected and explained most interestingly in the ECB’s 2003 report, and we thoroughly endorse this orientation and the way in which it was justified in the 2003 report. Firstly, we are told that, in order to offset the risk of deflation, it is important to have inflation that is below, but close to 2%, so that actual interest rates might be taken to a negative level. Secondly, we are told that the M3 money supply is important in the long term, yet not in setting monetary policy. I feel that both of these theories are perfectly justified. Our report welcomes this major orientation, and we shall table the amendments again to welcome it even more clearly. For the future, the 2003 report contains a further point that is extremely important, which is a clear statement by the ECB, as a public authority, that it is accountable to the general public and that this accountability entails dialogue with Parliament. I feel that by putting itself forward as something of an executive body, in view of the fact that its relationship with the general public involves interacting with Parliament, this ECB report represents a major step forward. I feel that the next step is to develop this dialogue further, and in our report we make proposals to this end. Thirdly, in our proposals for the future, we are naturally thinking about the new countries’ accession. We consider that these countries should be treated equally and with the same criteria for meeting the convergence criteria as those that have been thus far applied to all countries. This is not an issue of two weights and measures; the same rules apply to 2005, 2006 and 2007 as applied in 1997. Lastly, we must start to consider the new generation of bank notes. We feel that we must keep the one and two cent coins and many of us feel that we should introduce a 1-euro note. It is essential, in our view, that bank notes and coins should bring the general public closer to its currency. It is time to put living people on our notes, as every country in the world does.

 Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, the Group of the Greens warmly congratulates the Commission on its plans for reforming the Stability and Growth Pact and is delighted that the Council appears to have given it a warm welcome. Starting with the Dublin and Amsterdam Councils, the Greens had taken the view that the Pact would, in time of recession, be neither applicable nor applied. That is what has come to pass. The Council imposed no sanction on the big countries when they went over the 3% threshold. Today, they account for 80% of Europe’s domestic product, and it is certain that, without this policy, Europe’s stagnation in 2003 would have turned into a recession. At the same time, the United States, China, Japan and even the United Kingdom triggered global recovery by applying a budgetary policy that would have been prohibited in Europe. There is indeed a need for reform of what President Prodi, two years ago, called ‘the stupid Pact’. Of the four recommendations that we made at that time, the Commission accepted three: to push for the restoration of a balanced budget only during periods of growth; to tolerate reasonable deficits during periods when growth is poor; to lay down monetary and budgetary rules as part of the governance of democratically debated broad economic policy guidelines. We do, to be sure, regret the failure to consider our proposal to remove from the remaining deficits those investments in the areas covered by the Gothenburg and Kyoto targets: economy in energy, shared large-scale transport networks, and renewable energies. However, we reject the idea that provisions for future expenditure, such as retirement pensions, should be included among debts from now on, for we need to bear in mind that, apart from the ageing process, the disruption of the climate is the most significant debt bequeathed to future generations. If, though, the Council proceeds now to adopt the Commission’s proposals, it will demonstrate that the requirement for unanimity in twenty-five countries does not prevent necessary and intelligent reforms from being adopted. Today, our fellow-citizens need such evidence and we are grateful to you for it.
 President.  
– We are about to begin a rather special vote, since, for all those who, like me, are due to leave Parliament, I think that this final moment spent together will be somewhat emotional. I am going to take advantage of the time left us by some of our fellow Members who have arrived late and are taking their seats to pay tribute to the services, which have ensured that our Tower of Babel has never come crashing down. (Loud applause)
 Thank you to Birgitte Stensballe and to all of her team; to the ushers, who make sure that the documents always arrive at the right place, at the right time; to the technicians; to the secretaries; and to the translators. Obviously, thank you to the interpreters, to whom I offer my humblest apologies. I know the stress I have caused you as President by running through items very quickly. (Applause)
 I know that you secretly hope that my record of 900 amendments voted on in one hour will never be beaten! To conclude, I am going to let you in on a little secret, just while the last few Members take their seats. You perhaps wonder how we classify our amendments: is Amendment X, written in Latvian, closer to the original Portuguese text than Amendment Y, written in Slovenian? Who is responsible for this classification? Well, the answer is sitting next to me. It is this gentleman who has the formidable task of carrying out this semantic classification. Why entrust it to him? Quite simply because Paul Dunstan speaks 27 languages. (Applause)
 I believe that we can all be very proud of the quality and dedication of our staff.
 President.  
– Your personal statement is of course recorded, in accordance with our Rules of Procedure. If you do not mind, ladies and gentlemen, we shall not re-open the debate. I will give you 30 seconds, but I warn you that it will be 30 seconds only, as a gesture of goodwill, because these really are the last few moments of the parliamentary term.
 President.  
– I would inform you that it was indeed a point of order, under Rule 145 on personal statements. Mr Titley’s request to take the floor before our House was fully justified.
 President.  
– The next item is voting time. (For details of the outcome of the votes: see Minutes)
 President.  
– Our fellow Member, Hans-Peter Martin, has asked to take the floor; it really must be for a point of order.
 President.  
– It was not a point of order, but I had the good grace not to make a martyr of you.
 President.  
– Ladies and gentlemen, I am going to give you the opinion of the legal service and of the President of the European Parliament, since he has of course been consulted in accordance with our Rules of Procedure.
 President.  
– Please, please … The legal service has checked this carefully, from a technical perspective, from the perspective of the elements mentioned, from a content perspective and from the perspective of the period under examination. The legal service is of the opinion that the amendment is admissible, and this is also the opinion of the President of the European Parliament. It is therefore the opinion of Mr Pöttering only that shall prevail. Thus, I am sorry, Mr Nassauer, but the amendment is admissible. - Before the vote on paragraph 25
 President.  
– Yes, please excuse me, it was a slip of the tongue. Indeed, the majority was against. It was worth having it checked, but the services had already rectified my mistake. Thank you for your point.
 President.  
– I can in fact confirm that Amendment 1 is tabled as an addition.
 President.  
– It is true that we are coming to the final vote – may I say a few personal words of thanks to you for your confidence and for the friendship you have shown me for so long. For the last time in this parliamentary term, and for the last time in my existence, I am therefore going to ask you to vote. We shall then go our separate ways. I am convinced that, our political differences and our paths aside, we shall all remain true to Europe’s ideals, but you should know that, from my perspective, to have had the good fortune to chair these debates, in this collegial atmosphere, for 10 years will forever remain a very great honour in my life. (Loud applause)
 President.  
– Thank you.
 President.  
– As I myself am a Janus Member on the same committee as you, Mr Botopoulos, I had no option but to give you those 40 seconds.
 President.  
– Commissioner, on behalf of Parliament, as it is the last night sitting, please believe me when I say that we have been very aware of the excellence of our reports throughout this parliamentary term. Thank you once again.
 President.  
– The joint debate is closed. The vote will take place tomorrow at 12 noon. Written statements (Rule 142)
 President.  
– We will now proceed to today’s explanations of vote. I am sure this will provoke strong feelings among you, but there are very many Members who have put their names down to speak, and I believe they are present.
 President.  
– Mr Heaton-Harris, I will clarify a point in the Rules of Procedure for you. It is in fact after the vote, but not immediately after the vote. The difference enables us to interpret matters. We are coming to a report on which I am very happy that Mr Heaton-Harris wished to express an opinion, as it is Mr Onesta’s report. ***
 President.  
– According to my watch, we have just started on the last day of our legislative work. Mr Heaton-Harris, the honour is yours.
 President.  
– I am sorry that we cannot have explanations of vote by video; that would be wonderful.
 President.  
– If I remember the rule correctly, once our friends the interpreters have to work beyond midnight, they are entitled to a special break. We must, therefore, take on new teams to allow them a well­deserved rest. At 11.59 p.m. the rule does not apply, but at 12.01 a.m. it does apply, but I do not know the exact cost. ***
 President.  
– Forgive me for contradicting you, Mr Hannan, but the Committee on Constitutional Affairs discussed the issue a very long time ago: ‘once the debate is finished’ does not mean ‘immediately after the end of the debate’. We are currently at the ‘once the debate is finished’ stage, but I am sure you will come back to me in order to have that amended – I have faith in you.
 President.  
– Mrs Oviir, you are not bothering me in the slightest, moreover I am pleased to tell you that you are the last speaker, on the last report.
 President.  
– Mrs Oviir, your fan club has stayed to the end. The next sitting will start shortly, because it is already Thursday 7 May 2009, the last day of the sixth legislative term of the European Parliament.

 Mr President, after the large cake that was the Corbett report, I do not know whether this is the cherry; it is more like the little cake you get with your coffee, just as they slip you the bill. I am going to talk about petitions. We have seen in the past that the Rules of Procedure, as they stand, have caused us a few problems, as sometimes certain rules were difficult to interpret or even led to political deadlock as to the admissibility of this or that text. We have therefore tried to do some tidying up, to clarify and to consolidate, but that does not make it a revolution. First of all we want to better identify the petitioner, since, at the moment, when we receive half a tonne of petitions, it is not that clear who the contact person is. We will therefore ask the petitioners to specify who is, as it were, their leader; otherwise, we will decide to use the first name on the first page. We have established the right to withdraw from a petition. We are saying to the citizens, ‘you can submit a petition but you can also waive this right and request that your name be withdrawn from the list of signatories’. You are aware that Parliament can receive correspondence in minority languages, such as Galician, Basque, Catalan and so on, when they are recognised by the Member States. We have decided to extend this right to petitions, too. If we receive correspondence in certain languages which the Bureau recognises as languages for written communication with citizens, we shall also reply in those languages. The true reform, however, lies with admissibility. Until now, the members of the Committee on Petitions at times had to battle quite hard to find out whether a certain document really was a matter of European law or not. After all, since Europe extends to all areas, people were getting in through the back door. We have therefore tried to simplify things by giving a kind of admissibility incentive. If a quarter of the members of the Committee on Petitions regards a text as admissible, it will be considered, as there is no question of our restricting a vital right, a right which is, in any case, based on primary law. In the event of a declaration of inadmissibility, we shall even try to recommend possible means of redress. There must always be transparency, since the petitioner’s name and the content of the petition will always be published on our registers, but if, in order to protect privacy, the petitioner asks for anonymity, we will be able to provide this. The same holds true if confidentiality is requested during discussions. Naturally the petitioners’ right to speak, at the discretion of the committee chairman, has been retained. As for the right to take follow-up action, we have extended it – or rather clarified it – to a degree, as in the past the Committee on Petitions could practically issue an own-initiative report on more or less anything and everything. We do not see why this committee should have more rights than the other committees. It will of course retain this right provided that there is no objection by the Conference of Presidents. The electronic register has been retained. If necessary there will be fact-finding visits in situ to establish facts or indeed to seek a solution. This role is one of mediator; it is something slightly original which we have decided to introduce, and which will be to Parliament’s credit. If need be, we will ask for the assistance of the Commission, represented this evening at the highest level, to clarify the application of Community law and, possibly, to supply information to us. The information collected will naturally be supplied to the Commission, the Council and the petitioner. However, what about the Treaty of Lisbon should it be ratified? You will be aware that a new type of petition is provided for by this Treaty – alongside the petitions submitted to the European Parliament which have existed for a very long time – namely petitions submitted to the European Commission, bearing at least one million signatures. We have simply decided that, in the event that the Lisbon Treaty is ratified, if a related issue is ever raised in a petition submitted by a million citizens to the Commission, we in Parliament would check whether we were dealing with an identical issue and whether or not the petition submitted to the Commission could affect our work, in which case we would simply inform the petitioners. Well, Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I think I have more or less summed up the situation. There is no revolution then, just some clarifications and the prevention of any possible deadlock.
 Gérard Onesta,  
rapporteur. 
− (FR)
 Mr President, I will try to answer my fellow Members. Mr Leinen, you are absolutely right: it was a slip of the tongue. The procedures are completely different when it comes to appealing to the Commission under the provisions of the possible future Treaty, and appealing to Parliament via the petitions procedure. However, in the hypothetical event that these two types of appeal – which are very different in terms of place and format – should concern an identical issue, we decided that the petitioners should be notified in order to ascertain whether or not it is appropriate to continue our investigations. We simply opted to strengthen coordination in this scenario. I do spell things out, but you were right to ask me for this linguistic clarification. I will continue my linguistic explanations with Mr Botopoulos’s question. Obviously, there is no question of adding to this Tower of Babel, which is already extremely complex: just look at the number of interpreters still here this evening. We are quite clear that it is Parliament’s Bureau which decides that petitions and correspondence with petitioners will be drawn up in other languages used in a Member State. These languages must therefore be recognised in the State, and the State must ask for this. This is currently the case for only four languages. If tomorrow I wanted to write in Volapük – an imaginary language – clearly it would not be recognised by any State, and neither Parliament nor the Bureau would reply in that language; all that is clearly specified. Regarding issues of conflict between the committees to which Mr Corbett drew our attention, I would point out that my report states, in accordance with Rule 46 and Annex VI, that the Committee on Petitions can already seek the opinion of another committee which has ‘specific responsibility for the issue under examination’. You say that, in this case, conflict could still arise. Well, we have put in place an arbiter, since the Committee on Petitions will not be able to issue own-opinion reports or go against an own-initiative report of a responsible committee unless the Conference of Presidents allows it. We have a referral system, namely the Conference of Presidents, which will decide whether it is down to the Committee on Petitions or the responsible committee to take action, in the event that both committees are unable to reach an agreement. We have therefore made provision for a safeguard in any case. I think that, with those clarifications made, we can conclude, Mr President. I have waited almost 20 years for the right to speak for six minutes in the Chamber, but to do so before an audience such as this was a real pleasure.
 President.  
– You know our Rules of Procedure as well as I do, Mrs Berès. I can use the gavel for all the Members, but I can only invite the Commission and the Council to be concise, as you have so notably been. Commissioner, I beg you. You have no time limit, but please be aware that I have a piece of paper in front of me which says that five minutes would be acceptable.
 President.  
– I would point out that, in accordance with Rule 103(2) of the Rules of Procedure, I have received six motions for resolutions(1)

 President.  
– The next item is voting time. (For details of the outcome of the votes: see Minutes)
 ***
 President.  
– Your comment will be passed on to the competent bodies. ***
 President.  
– I am sure, Mrs Lulling, that this detail had not escaped the Members of this House, but I gave the floor to our rapporteur because she did not have the opportunity to speak during the debates. As you know, she is entitled to two minutes; therefore, for two minutes the rapporteur has total freedom. This has been respected.
 President.  
– In accordance with Rule 170(4) of the Rules of Procedure, it was a political group that just spoke. The procedure asks whether a speaker wishes to speak for or against.
 President.  
– I shall put the request for postponement to the vote. (Parliament decided to postpone the final vote)
 President.  
– We in the services were not in receipt of this information. Only the final vote shall be postponed, then. I should point out that we are going to vote first on the amendments.
 President.  
– In fact, this is absolutely not what the services had understood, but we shall of course go along with our rapporteur. Therefore, if I have understood correctly, we are going to vote on the amendments to the report on Turkmenistan, not to your report. Then we shall stop before the final vote. – Before the vote on Amendment 2
 President.  
– This is a legal point. Can those Members who oppose it please stand up? I cannot see 40 Members standing up. Therefore, we shall include what Mrs Flautre said, and I shall now record this paragraph as having been orally amended. (The oral amendment was accepted)
 President.  
– I can confirm that, if an oral amendment is to be adopted, it must be expressed orally, which has not been the case, in spite of my request. You have therefore understood perfectly.
 President.  
– That concludes voting time.
 President.  
– I believe that Mr Tannock wished to speak. Let me just remind you of the rule. It is not the same as under the ‘catch-the-eye’ procedure. You have to register before the explanations of vote begin, but I can be flexible.
 President.  
– I did not wish to cut you off in the midst of your lyrical musings.
 President.  
– That concludes the explanations of vote. Our sitting is now going to be suspended. It will be resumed at 3 p.m. – shortly – with an oral question on the role of culture in the development of European regions.
 President. - 
 The item is closed.

 President.  
– Ladies and gentlemen, allow me to explain a point in our Rules of Procedure. To speak during the explanations of vote, you must make a request to the services before the start of these explanations. Of course, I am very flexible and I allow the Members present to speak. But we are not using the ‘catch the eye’ procedure. You have to put your name down beforehand, prior to the explanations of vote.
 President.  
– The next item is the joint debate on: -	the oral question to the Council on the state of play of SIS II, by Mr Coelho, on behalf of the Group of the European People’s Party (Christian Democrats) and European Democrats, Mrs Roure, on behalf of the Socialist Group in the European Parliament, and Mr Lax, on behalf of the Group of the Alliance of Liberals and Democrats for Europe (O-0005/2009
 – B6-0010/2009
), and -	the oral question to the Commission on the state of play of SIS II, by Mr Coelho, on behalf of the Group of the European People’s Party (Christian Democrats) and European Democrats, Mrs Roure, on behalf of the Socialist Group in the European Parliament, and Mr Lax, on behalf of the Group of the Alliance of Liberals and Democrats for Europe (O-0006/2009

 The next item is a brief presentation of the report (A6-0011/2009
) by Jonathan Evans, on behalf of the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs, on the reports on competition policy 2006 and 2007 (2008/2243(INI)
).
 President.  
– The item is closed. The vote will take place tomorrow. The next item was to be a brief presentation of the report (A6-0003/2009
) by Claire Gibault, on behalf of the Committee on Women’s Rights and Gender Equality, on equal treatment and access for men and women in the performing arts (2008/2182(INI)
). I think it is a very interesting report. Unfortunately, Mrs Gibault has informed us that she is unable to attend this evening to present her report. In compliance then with the Rules of Procedure, I am unable to give the floor to anyone else as she has not delegated anyone. The brief presentation of her report will not therefore take place. However, the vote on this report will be held tomorrow, as set out in the agenda.
 President. - 
 I declare the 2008-2009 session of the European Parliament closed.
 Gérard Onesta,  
rapporteur. − (FR) 
Madam President, let us try to be precise. This report amends our regulation, or rather clarifies it, in order to make it clear how petitions to the Committee on Petitions are received or not received, how information is given to petitioners, and so on. It was approved unanimously, with one vote against I think, in the Committee on Constitutional Affairs. I do not think, therefore, that this report is very controversial. There is, however, one article in which we had agreed to make it clear that if and when the Treaty of Lisbon came into force, petitioners would simply be informed if a petition that were submitted not to Parliament but to the European Commission – you know, those petitions with millions of signatures – were connected to their petition. If I understand rightly, it is that article, because of the reference to a possible future treaty that causes a problem. Personally, I can live with postponing it until 5 March; I can even live with a ‘speed vote’ withdrawing that amendment. On the other hand, it would be very regrettable if we could not tidy up our regulation on this point when there have been so many problems in the past. I am in your hands, ladies and gentlemen.
 President.  
– The next item is the joint debate on: - the report (A6-0019/2009
) by Jacek Saryusz-Wolski, on behalf of the Committee on Foreign Affairs, on the annual report on the main aspects and basic choices of the Common Foreign and Security Policy (CFSP) in 2007, presented to the European Parliament in application of point G, paragraph 43 of the Interinstitutional Agreement of 17 May 2006 (2008/2241(INI)
), - the report (A6-0032/2009
) by Karl von Wogau, on behalf of the Committee on Foreign Affairs, on the European Security Strategy and the European Security and Defence Policy (ESDP) (2008/2202(INI)
), and - the report (A6-0033/2009
) by Ari Vatanen, on behalf of the Committee on Foreign Affairs, on the role of NATO in the security architecture of the EU (2008/2197(INI)
). Ladies and gentlemen, if you are not interested in following our debates, our rapporteur asks, rightly so, and for the dignity of our work, if you could please leave the Chamber in silence.
 President.  
– We take note of this comment. Perhaps our evening debates should be more animated and more heated so as to warm up the atmosphere. It is true, though, that the Chamber is large. On this fundamental issue, which will do a great deal to advance European research, the debate is closed. The vote will take place on Thursday, 19 February 2009. Written statements (Rule 142)
 President.  
– Before giving the floor to our rapporteur, I would like to clarify something for Mrs Doyle. We have looked into the technicalities. A little over a year ago, on 8 January 2008, you received a communication from the Deputy Secretary-General, on a decision of the Conference of Presidents of 27 October 2007. Point 3(B) very clearly states that ‘catch the eye’ time is a maximum of five minutes, and is limited to a maximum of one minute per speaker. That is the rule, but it was such a pleasure to listen to you that we took great delight in hearing what you had to say. We now come to our rapporteur, Mrs Riera-Madurell.
 President.  
– Well, you present me with a quandary. The Rules of Procedure state one minute. One minute.
 President.  
– The next item is a short presentation of the report (A6-0039/2009
) by Mrs Kinnock, on behalf of the Committee on Development, on a special place for children in EU external action (2008/2203(INI)
).
 President.  
– Many thanks, Commissioner. Indeed, your speech was very interesting and on an issue that is also very important. The item is closed. The vote will take place on Thursday, 19 February 2009. Written statements (Rule 142)
 President.

 Madam President, what is obviously a pity is that the victims of racism and discrimination have not been the focus of the Durban Conference. This is of course because of the President of Iran’s scandalous hijacking of the conference, which was – and I must voice my dismay at this – a trap into which several EU Member States fell. That is the problem. Personally, I would like to thank the Member States of the European Union that nevertheless made and continue to make a commitment; we have conclusions that are wholly honourable, even if they are imperfect. I would also like to hear the Presidency speak about the efforts made or not made by the Member States to ensure that the European Union did not appear disorganised at this conference, a state of affairs that was particularly pitiful.
 Hélène Flautre,  
on behalf of the Verts/ALE Group.
 – (FR) 
Madam President, the annual report prepared by Mr Obiols i Germà is excellent. Its aim, like that of all of the activities carried out in this parliamentary term by the Subcommittee on Human Rights, is to fill the gap between word and deed in Europe’s external action and to root out any inconsistencies and weaknesses in our policy, beginning with the Member States, which are too often at odds with international law. It is enough to mention the treatment inflicted on migrants, the cooperation with the CIA’s secret flights or the failure to ratify international conventions. The Council’s requirements too are inconsistent. How does one explain that the Council has not yet given the go-ahead to implement Article 2 of the association agreement with Israel after the persistent violations that we are observing? Our policies are compartmentalised. They therefore often lack a global perspective and are not integrated, and our instruments are not optimised, are not put in sequence. Imagine this: the Council has published a communication to welcome its human rights subcommittee with Tunisia, even though with that country we are still unable to support human rights activists because of the barriers it is putting up. In our successive own-initiative reports, we have put forward specific recommendations, such as the drafting of human rights strategies by country and the more direct participation of Members in the policies, and we have succeeded in shifting the boundaries. I am thinking of the guidelines on torture, for example. Today, human rights activists are better protected, and I welcome the fact that human rights clauses are now being studied in the Council and the Commission. Moreover, I wish to point out on this occasion that we would like this clause to be reworded. We would like a mechanism regulating the opening of a dialogue to be implemented and to appear systematically in all European Union agreements. For five years we have been ready to start work with the Council and the Commission to improve the Union’s policy. The task is under way, today at least, and I would like warmly to thank them, since their receptiveness, and that of all my fellow Members, has been essential to this success and to the increased credibility that we have, today, in this area.

Mr President, the final declaration of the Durban II Review Conference, which Afghanistan is taking part in, concluded only today on the absolute need to make all forms of violence against women criminal offences punishable by law and on the condemnation of any judicial arsenal based on discrimination, including religious discrimination. At the same time, Afghanistan is promoting legislation that applies solely to the Shiite population and that clearly discriminates against women in the areas of marriage, divorce, child custody, inheritance and access to education. This is completely schizophrenic. What Afghanistan signs up to in Geneva, it cannot reject in Kabul. By taking part in the Durban II conference, Afghanistan has made firm commitments to eradicating multiple discrimination. It is imperative, for its credibility, that it starts taking action now. By refusing to pass this law, the minister of justice and the president would be showing their will to commit their country to complying with its human rights obligations. Equality between men and women is clearly enshrined in the Afghan constitution and in international conventions to which Afghanistan is a party. The authorities have a duty not to give in to extremism in any way and not to retreat. It is ultimately the future of a society that is being decided through this draft law, and Afghan society has already expressed its desire not to remain excluded from these debates. Women are fighting and deserve all the support and all the protection of their country. It is up to the authorities to meet their obligations and demonstrate their ability to fulfil their commitments, and to the European civilian forces on the ground to support them in this ambitious reconstruction, and to set an example. Let us not forget that the acts of violence committed by our armies and the fact that war is plunging Afghanistan into poverty are simply swelling the ranks of extremists.

Mr President, who were they? How many were there? Where had they come from? Were there children, women, refugees? Did coastguards hamper the boats’ journey? Did fishermen cross their path? So many unanswered questions. The human cost of the tragedy is not known, but hundreds perished, joining the thousands of migrants who have drowned in the Mediterranean. Let us have the decency, as we do tonight, not to blame the weather. Hundreds of migrants have taken the route to exile in inhuman and highly dangerous conditions. Why is that? It is because they are fleeing devastated regions, because the less dangerous routes are closed to them and because they have not given up hope for life. Yes, it is indeed the anti-immigration mechanisms that encourage migrants to take increasingly risky routes to flee the desolation of their countries that are the cause. Was it not the forthcoming announcement of joint patrols in Italy and Libya that hastened the departure of boats to Europe in recent weeks? Yes, Europe’s obsession with shoring up its borders and its determination to focus the weight of its administration on third countries that destroy freedom, are lethal. The overemphasis on law and order, the patrols and the barbed wired fences will not overcome their desire to escape. So the question is this: is Europe ready to take responsibility for the consequences of such a choice? No, it is not, and this is why I am asking the Commission and the Member States: – firstly, to do everything in their power to find and, if possible, rescue the people who have disappeared at sea, and to investigate the circumstances of this wreck; – secondly, to reaffirm international maritime law, which makes it mandatory to provide assistance to anyone in distress, while the seven Tunisian fishermen are still on trial; – thirdly, to halt all negotiations on migration issues with countries that do not provide any guarantees of respect for human rights; – fourthly, to respect the right of every human being to leave any country and ask for international protection in any country. You are right, the people who disappeared at sea are not illegal migrants; – fifthly, to put an end to the restrictive visa policy, which is often arbitrary and unfair; – and lastly, to closely examine, from the point of view of development in third countries, all the European Union’s policies, including the predation of mining resources, agricultural dumping, free-trade agreements, trade in weapons and indulgent cooperation with autocrats.

Mr President, the excellent amendment tabled by my group and which will enable us to carry real weight in the area of human rights would be further improved if we replaced ‘the prospect of signing the Agreement’ with ‘the prospect of finalising the process of ratifying the Agreement’, which is the appropriate phrase.
 Hélène Flautre,

Mr President, I believe that we must try not to fool ourselves but realise that, although Valery Pal has been released, the Turkmen Government will continue to abduct, imprison and torture other people in Turkmenistan for thought crimes. Although the United Nations Special Rapporteur on Freedom of Religion has travelled to Turkmenistan, nine other special rapporteurs are still awaiting their permits, and these are people who cover such important areas as torture, defence of human rights, independence of the judiciary, education, health, freedom of expression, and so on. Several speeches really seem like exercises in self-persuasion. We continue to be faced with one of the world’s most repressive and closed regimes, even if there has been some progress and even if we do need to find the right strategy to support this. It is important for us not to be naïve, either, or obviously to demand that Turkmenistan become a model of democracy and human rights before reaching any agreement with it in advance. So, between these two extremes, what should we do? I propose quite simply that we have a real foreign policy, and that we meet criteria which are extremely precise, which are measurable, which are realistic and which are those of the European Parliament. I am thinking of entry permits for independent NGOs and United Nations special rapporteurs, and for the International Red Cross. We know that negotiations are under way, but they are not completed. I am thinking of the realignment of the education system with international standards – which is under way but still very far from satisfactory – of the release of all the political prisoners and of their freedom of movement – in short, of the ABC of human rights. My group’s proposal is both ambitious and realistic. It can be reduced to a simple formula. (The President interrupted the speaker to ask her to speak more slowly, at the request of the interpreters)
 We cannot sabotage our own policy by renouncing our values. It is not a question of advocating Turkmenistan’s isolation, but of engaging with the country. So, how should we do this? Well, we should take two pencils, one in each hand. With the first pencil, we are going to sign a road map, which will set out the stages required to meet the criteria laid down by Parliament. These stages will be marked out over time, with precise timelines, and will be discussed at the human rights sub-committees held with the country. Once we have signed this road map, with the other hand and the other pencil we will be able to sign the interim agreement that is before us. I believe that, when the time comes for the Commission and the Council to discuss the future of the human rights clauses, it is imperative that these clauses be systematic and be systematically accompanied by a consultation mechanism that can result, where necessary, in the suspension of this agreement.

 Mr President, according to information from the CIA and NGOs, 728 prisoners passed through Portuguese territorial space between 2002 and 2006 on their way to Guantánamo. What are the figures for Spain, Italy or any other Member State? Having failed to take the lead against the exemption from international law in the fight against terrorism, the Union is now attempting to go along with Mr Obama’s commitments. This explains why we have this still timid call from members encouraging Member States to receive those innocent detainees who cannot return to their own countries for fear of torture. This is done not out of solidarity, nor charity, nor even generosity, but purely to comply with our international commitments. Beyond the message sent by Mr Obama, will Europe be able to raise itself up, will Europe not only be able to investigate, target and assume its responsibilities, but also bring an end to its illegal complicity in extraordinary rendition? Will Europe be able to reform the control of its own secret services? Will the Union be able to rehabilitate the victims via legal processes and compensation? I welcome Mr Barrot’s declaration of intent to this end. I have to say, however, that whilst we are finding out more and more about what the ex-prime minister of Portugal covered up between 2002 and 2004, the results of his initiatives as the head of the European Commission to get the Union out of this grey area of non-legality remain completely unknown to us.

Mr President, I should like to draw the European Parliament’s attention to the deterioration – if such a thing were still possible – of the human rights situation in Tunisia. Since 11 December, Sihem Bensedrine, a well-known human rights defender and editor-in-chief of Kalima
, has been the subject of press harassment and slanderous remarks that are absolutely intolerable and incompatible with the rule of law. On 23 January, Mr Amin, who is the coordinator of the Maghreb Coordination of Human Rights Organisations, was refused entry into Tunisia. On 28 January, Radio Kalima, which has been broadcast via satellite since that date, was completely surrounded. Its journalists were imprisoned, and those who came to their aid were manhandled in the street. This radio station is still being surrounded by the Tunisian police, with the result that freedom of information and expression are being undermined. Tomorrow there will be the appeal hearing of the Gafsa workers, who are fighting against corruption and against their exploitation in this Tunisian coal mining area, with a denial of justice that we saw during the first hearing. The heads of mission in Tunis are concerned about the situation; they have discussed it, and are perhaps discussing it at this very moment. They were meeting today. I call on you, Mr President, to take a major political initiative in order to put a stop to these systematic human rights violations in Tunisia.

Mr President, in Gaza, we have seen war and we have seen death, but we have also seen people, living people, people who have the right to live and whom we have a duty to protect. Protecting the civilian population – this is the real emergency. Nothing can excuse the fact that not everything has been done to protect this population, and I would ask you, Mr President-in-Office of the Council, do you feel, today, that you have done everything you can to ensure that the Israeli authorities call an immediate halt to this indiscriminate and disproportionate military operation? The answer is most certainly ‘No’. When rumours of the operation were circulating in the embassies the Council, against Parliament’s wishes, reaffirmed its determination to step up its relations. This was a tragic mistake! When NGOs call on the Security Council to have the International Criminal Court investigate alleged war crimes, the Council is unable to invoke the ‘human rights’ clause of its agreement with Israel. I am sick of hearing that we cannot do better, that we have done all we can. It is in fact the deadlock of your essentially humanitarian policy to alleviate the damage caused by the military occupation and the war that is the biggest failure. How far will we have to go in terms of violations of international law before we have the ‘human rights’ clause applied? If we are not capable, today, of asking ourselves questions about the scope of effective mechanisms for applying pressure and for implementing, then I do not really know what kind of situation will justify our finally taking action. I tell you straight: if the business-as-usual approach continues and remains an ongoing part of our relations with Israel, with the 1 000 deaths in Gaza, you will bury Article 11 of the Treaty, you will bury the Union’s ‘human rights’ policy and you will bury the European project!

 Madam President, it is a real shame to hold this debate in the Council’s absence, just as it is extremely regrettable – since it is not 15 minutes late, but three and a quarter hours late – to have awarded this Sakharov Prize without the Council being here with us today, together with the European Commission. I should like to raise an urgent point. Yesterday, Israel denied the United Nations Special Rapporteur access to Palestinian territories. I believe that this is an extremely aggressive act that calls for an immediate response from the Council and the Commission and, particularly with regard to strengthening relations between the EU and Israel, the message must be absolutely clear and immediate. This report – like every year, I would say – is both a good document since it constitutes a statement of activities that is extremely useful as a working document but, at the same time, it does not contain all the elements of critical analysis, impact assessments and the strategies adopted by the Council to integrate human rights fully into the framework, for instance, of our energy policies, our trade policies or our security policies. Parliament undertook this exercise. It is a delicate exercise and what you hear is clearly not always pleasant. I must say, however, that the idea of a Sakharov Prize network, for example, was developed in this report and from this study. Today, this network is formed in this 20th 
anniversary declaration and many proposals are now on the table, including a Sakharov Prize office, Sakharov passports, and a Sakharov fund to support our prizes and human rights defenders throughout the world. There is no shortage of ideas. I am delighted that this presentation was given together with the following report on fundamental rights in the Union. Mr Obiols i Germà is right. It is a vital task for the Union to link up its achievements, internally, and its objectives, externally. It is even a crucial guarantee of its credibility. I would like to say that we must not fail to respond to the abundant criticisms emanating from all continents and all international organisations with regard to the European Union’s asylum and immigration policy. We must not fail to respond to the complicity of Member States of the European Union in the fight against terrorism, which has allowed the rendition and torture of a number of presumed terrorists.

 Mr President, six months after the shameful vote on the ‘Return’ directive that received so many jeers and criticisms internationally, I very much doubt that the Union will be able, by adopting these two texts on the Blue Card and the single permit, to redeem itself on the international stage. Why? Because it was announced, very pompously, that a genuine European policy on legal migration would be established, and we now find ourselves with a third-rate status for workers, which provides no social support, the loss of the residence permit if they lose their job, limited access to unions and restricted freedom of movement. This is not the hallmark of a great ambition and the Union is far from rivalling the United States or Canada with this Blue Card, assuming moreover that that is itself a laudable objective. Is it really asking too much to grant genuine social protection guarantees and equal treatment, the same as for national workers? Do we prefer to reduce these workers to a workforce liable to the corvée? Would ratifying the UN Convention on the protection of migrant workers and members of their families have guaranteed them too many rights? Finally, I ask myself – I ask you – what is the logic in wanting to attract migrant workers into the Union while refusing to regularise those persons already working on our territory, who are working legally and doing so with no residence permit? The Union is embarking on a legal migration policy, but under protest, and it is the utilitarian logic and the exceptions to equal rights decided by each Member State that are liable to assert themselves. When are we going to understand – and above all accept – that migration is a chance, an opportunity in terms of human development, in terms of economic and social development, in terms of the development even of countries of the South and in terms of intercultural dialogue, of which we have been making so much this year?

Madam President, it is indeed the task of the European Commission to guarantee transparency, better information and protection for our citizens and consumers, as Mr Barroso rightly said. There is, however, one domain, Mr Barroso, in which your Commission has been particularly unsuccessful in that respect, namely the authorisation procedures for genetically modified organisms (GMOs). These procedures have drawn criticism from all quarters. They ought to be reviewed at the next meeting of the Council of Environment Ministers on 4 and 5 November. There are 44 European regions that have declared themselves GM-free. Six Member States have invoked the safeguard clause for Monsanto maize. In the face of opposition from a large majority of Europeans, what are you doing, Mr Barroso? You are fast-tracking marketing licences. You are issuing approvals, meekly following the advice of the European Food Safety Authority, whose opinion is itself based on toxicity studies conducted by bio-engineering companies. European procedures in their present form are a veritable sieve through which the commercial interests of agribusiness can percolate freely. People want to know about the toxic effects of GMOs, and they must be told. Do you yourself know how toxic they are, Mr Barroso? Do you know? What effects does the toxicity of GMOs have on public health and the environment? Why is there no requirement to publish the raw data on which the findings of studies are based? Why are tests not compulsory after three months? Why make do with studies conducted by the companies themselves? The public are entitled to transparency, to information, to discussion. These should be the aims of the Commission when it comes to approving GMOs. What we want, Mr Barroso, is the publication of raw data. We want to see dissenting studies, we want public debate, and we want long-term testing. We want to know the health impact of GMOs. Your initiative, Mr Barroso, to create a group of sherpas from the 27 Member States to bypass the Presidency’s ad hoc 
group and to bypass your own Commissioners who are competent in these matters sows confusion and obscurity in an area where it is your responsibility to guarantee the clarity and reliability of procedures. You want the public to have confidence in Europe, do you not, Mr Barroso? Then prove it!

 Madam President, with this financial crisis, the European Pact on Immigration and Asylum will fade into the background. Perhaps that is no bad thing. Perhaps that is where it should have always been. We were actually wondering how this Pact on Immigration and Asylum differs compared with the policies followed for years by the European Union and by Member States. Well, it is true! With this new Pact, what will change for migrants who are the victims of police violence, of human trafficking, of absurd red tape? Does it sanction their human dignity, their rights? Will it sanction the International Convention on the Protection of the Rights of All Migrant Workers and Members of Their Families? No! For the victims of poverty, war, natural disaster, the increasing restrictions on the right of asylum, what will change? Will people start to question how ridiculous it is having to apply for asylum in the first country of refuge? Will there be an end to summary examinations and the unreliable, shall we say, lists of safe countries? For migrants who are legally employed and who are a real part of our economic and social life, will this mean that they are officially recognised? No! What about migrants, including minors, who are imprisoned or expelled, even to countries where they will be mistreated, where they have no family, where they do not speak the language; will this change? Will we abandon readmission and transit agreements in countries where there are human rights violations? No! You realise that people all over the world are booing asylum and immigration policy. You can no longer go to an international conference without hearing about the massive rights violations suffered by migrants due to European asylum and immigration policy. I believe that this has to change. We need a policy based on pragmatism and not on hypocrisy, which is the trademark of the European Pact on Immigration and Asylum.

 Mr President, the Russian Foreign Affairs Minister Mr Lavrov accused Mr Kouchner of having a ‘sick imagination’ when he talked about sanctions against Russia. It was on this ‘imagination’ that I was asked to work during this report. I would like to thank the Commission and the Council, which proved perfectly available and helpful. What is today’s debate on sanctions in fact about? It is essentially about two things: the first is a critique of the use of sanctions to punish dirty rotten scoundrels on the international scene, namely anyone who tries to block my strategic interests: politicised sanctions with double standards. The second critique considers the fact that sanctions are not effective, essentially because they have perverse effects, people always get round them, and they should therefore not be used. The purpose of this report is not to call for more sanctions, or for harsher sanctions, or for sanctions to be abandoned. It is essential for us to find out what conditions make sanctions effective and the aim of this report is actually to examine them from all angles. Effective in relation to what? In relation to what we are trying to achieve. As regards violations of human rights or international or humanitarian law, what we must aim for is a change in the behaviour of those being targeted. That is the key point. Sanctions are neither a punishment nor the application of a kind of European criminal code for international use. Sanctions are, politically, a tricky tool to handle and are very demanding to implement, and they seek to achieve a change in practices and behaviour. Very reluctant to go for all-out sanctions, the EU is currently maintaining 31 sanctions regimes against third countries or entities, mostly arms embargoes and targeted sanctions designed to have maximum impact on the entities whose behaviour they intend to influence, while limiting as far as possible any harmful humanitarian effects. On the face of it, this is something positive but I cannot tell you any more at this stage. The EU continues to act without ever having carried out any overall impact assessments. We therefore remain rather powerless to evaluate the ability of our sanctions to solve crises and promote human rights. The aim of this report is therefore to speak up for a more transparent, more consistent and therefore more credible European sanctions policy. The first essential job is to undertake an evaluation exercise. The second is to adopt a stringent method, through prior studies of specific situations where sanctions are required to decide the best response to bring about a change. Over the last few days, you have been through the measures at the EU’s disposal to influence the Russian authorities, for example. The positive conclusion we can draw is that the stated objective is clear and can be evaluated practically. That is, compliance with the six points of the agreement. It has to be this way in all circumstances. It is essential to include clear benchmarks, which should, until the end – and that sometimes means for a long time – remain necessary and sufficient conditions to be met for the sanctions to be lifted. These benchmarks therefore need to be realistic and objectively measurable. Although the arms embargo imposed on China after Tiananmen is perfectly legitimate, we should not be surprised if it is not having any positive effects since the European Union did not make the lifting of the embargo dependent on any particular demands. All too often, the sanctions policy is vague and flexible, swayed by the political contingencies of the most influential Member States or the commercial or geopolitical importance of the targeted entity. That is why, to give the EU’s policy credibility, I am proposing the creation of a network of independent experts responsible for helping the Commission with the difficult job it does, under incredible circumstances since it has almost no resources to do this. Make no mistake. I am not talking about taking away the Council’s prerogatives of political impetus or the Commission’s right of proposal; I am simply talking about offering the guarantee of an informed decision. However, that is not all. Sanctions are an instrument. They are one instrument of many – I am referring back to the first two reports by the Subcommittee on Human Rights – a comprehensive and integrated policy needs to be developed; there can be no effective sanctions without a human rights strategy for the country in question. Sanctions must be discussed at all levels and the monitoring mechanisms, for example the ‘human rights’ clause, must be used to the full. All sanctions against a country must be accompanied by visible, and therefore political, but also concrete support for human rights defenders in the country. That is also one of the report’s key points. To finish, this report also considers that any voluntary and irreversible damage to the environment generates human rights violations and it therefore asks for its inclusion among the reasons for applying sanctions. It recalls that EU sanctions are not just against third countries but also against physical and legal entities such as mercenaries or indeed multinationals, which defy international law by operating almost with impunity. In short, this report tries to respond to the current nature of world crises.

 Mr President, I am pleased that this discussion has been held and about what each of you, and the President-in-Office of the Council and the Commission, have contributed. I believe that through this discussion, something resembling a common philosophy is emerging. I have heard many calls for a more consistent policy, a more credible policy, which avoids double standards, and it seems to me that these are the issues we need to keep working on. I learned a lot in writing this report, through discussions with various people. I truly believe there is still a lot of work to do, and that the basis of this future work shall and must be a comprehensive and exhaustive evaluation of the current sanctions policy because, when the question is asked – and we see it today with Russia – things immediately get very heated, and the media are instantly on the lookout. We therefore need a very solid philosophy and we really have to be in step and in agreement about our procedures and policy. I think that to do this – I am coming back to the question of the network of experts – it is not a matter of using technical expertise to replace sensitive political decisions, but of ensuring that the sensitive political decisions are based as far as possible on objective information. When you engage in a sanctions policy, you have to see it through and to respect what many of you have called ‘completely objective benchmarks’, which let you measure the real effectiveness of the sanctions. I believe we are making really concrete progress. There are still a few points to be clarified – you will all have realised this from several of the speeches – and these were the reason for my abstention in the Committee on Foreign Affairs. I think, ladies and gentlemen, that we cannot sell ourselves short on requirements for full respect for human rights and international law in drawing up blacklists, in putting people’s names on these lists or taking them off. The Court of Justice judgment you have just talked about, Mr Jouyet, fully encourages us to pursue this. Ladies and gentlemen, I invite you to adopt, not a perfect report, but a very honourable report of which we can be proud, and which will be a good working tool.

Mr President, Obeida Assida is a Palestinian student. He was arrested in 2003, at the age of 17, and is being held in administrative detention in Israel, without charges and without a trial. Saed Yassine is a Palestinian champion of human rights. He is 34. He has been held in administrative detention in Israel since 2006. He has not been charged and nothing is known against him, and his wife and children have only been able to visit him three times. Noura al Hashlamoun is a 36-year-old housewife and the mother of six children. She has been held in administrative detention in Israel since September 2006, without charges and without a trial. Marwan Barghouti, the instigator and writer of the prisoners’ document, has been held in Israel since April 2002. Moreover, I would draw my fellow MEPs’ attention to the fact that an appeal for his release is still circulating, and you are welcome to sign it at any time. Everybody knows that if I were to go through the long list of thousands of Palestinian prisoners currently held in Israeli prisons, in total violation of international and human rights law, I should need a great deal of speaking time. Yet each of them, each of their families deserves a lengthy speech. For they have been spared nothing – brutal interrogation that may last up to 188 days and is known to include torture, confessions and judgments to be signed in Hebrew, detention without foundation in Israel, outside their own territory, arbitrarily renewable every six months, submission to an ad hoc
 and discriminatory military jurisdiction that has absolutely no legal justification, no access to a lawyer for the first 90 days of their detention, and virtually non-existent visiting rights. Mrs De Keyser is right to say that it is precisely this that the EU cannot accept. This is all totally unacceptable. And you tell us that you are going to use this new dialogue.

 Mr President, I would like to draw your attention to the events currently unfolding in Tunisia, in the Gafsa mining basin. For several weeks, rallies have been organised against the poverty in this basin, which is rich because it contains many phosphates. It has to be said that the local population is not profiting from the profits, and we are now seeing extremely serious police and military repression, with harassment, imprisonments, arrests, and the sealing off of towns, particularly Redeyef. I am asking the EU head of mission – through you, because I believe the European Parliament’s intervention is necessary – for this matter to be raised for discussion with the Tunisian authorities, for the Guidelines on Human Rights Defenders to be followed, since trade unionists are being imprisoned and we have several accounts of torture, and for the heads of mission to attend trials, meet families and ask for an explanation from the Tunisian authorities of the repression taking place there.

 Mr President, there is something that is really bothering me. Why did the rapporteur, Mr Weber, decide to deny the European Parliament’s powers by doing his utmost to get us to adopt at first reading a Council common position – moreover one that was basically unacceptable – at a time when we are having difficulty convincing citizens of the value of giving the European Parliament strengthened powers? You must explain this decision to me, Mr Weber. I really hope that tomorrow we will all live up to the expectations of European citizens and show that we are safeguarding the protection of human rights and the values of the European Union. Why? I do not think we can accept that unaccompanied minors may be locked up and expelled to countries where they have no family, no ties and no legal representative. This is an absolute violation of respect, in all circumstances, for the best interests of the child. Nor do I believe we can accept migrants having to suffer the traumatic and destructive conditions of 18 months’ detention when they have not committed any crime. This is an excessive deprivation of liberty, described as such by the case law of the European Court. Nor can we accept migrants being returned at the whim of re-entry agreements to countries where they have no ties and where, Mr Weber and Mr Deprez, we have no means of guaranteeing their physical or psychological safety. We have no way of guaranteeing the principle of non-refoulement
, even if it is writ large in your text. I therefore call upon all Members to reject tomorrow what is actually only an extension of the repressive, near-sighted policies of the Member States. Europe needs a different ambition for international immigration.

Mr President, I want to draw MEPs’ attention to Sami Essid’s expulsion from Italy to Tunisia on 3 June, in total violation of Italy’s commitments under the European Convention on Human Rights and, in particular, Article 3 thereof. Why? Because Mr Essid is accused of terrorism and the European Court of Human Rights has established without any doubt that any person accused of terrorism was without fail tortured in Tunisia. That is why the European Court asked Italy to suspend the expulsion measure. Nonetheless, Italy expelled him on 3 June, in total violation of its commitments. I ask both that Italy be reminded of its obligations as a party to the European Convention on Human Rights and as a Member State of the European Union, and for assurances that Mr Essid, now deported to Tunisia, will not suffer inhumane and degrading treatment there.

Madam President, the European Commission has put forward a good proposal. It has transformed a relatively clumsy political initiative – the ‘Union for the Mediterranean’ – into a renewed political ambition for a strengthened Barcelona Process. That is an excellent thing and, in this context, the Commission is performing its role to the letter. We support its proposals, particularly as regards incorporating the institutions of the future project in relation to the Lisbon Treaty and its goal of a more coherent and better integrated external policy for the Union. In so doing, it is putting an end to the justified fears of ad hoc
 political manoeuvring dictated by the agreements reached at the summit or on an à la carte or circumstantial basis, fears fuelled largely by the misplaced initiatives of President Sarkozy to promote, for example, the proliferation of nuclear power in the region. The mediocre results in terms of democracy and human rights were unanimously identified in 2005 as an obstacle to the Barcelona objectives. That is why the European Parliament insists that all the mechanisms aimed at strengthening democracy and the rule of law as well as the parliamentary dimension of the process and the participation of civil society must be duly guaranteed within the framework of this new ambition for the Euro-Mediterranean region. An amendment has been tabled on the conflict in the Middle East. Ladies and gentlemen, I think that the European Parliament would be well-advised to accept it. It is right to ensure that new initiatives in the region are not dependent on resolution of the conflict, but we would also be fooling ourselves if we ignored its negative impact on the concrete capacities to develop Mediterranean projects that are relevant to the citizens. Moreover, the ad hoc
 delegation that recently visited Palestine documented serious violations of humanitarian law and human rights, clear violations of the Oslo and Annapolis commitments. It would be futile to suggest that the persistence of this situation does not undermine profoundly the mutual trust between the partners and the civil societies in the region, trust that is nonetheless vital to the success of our Euro-Mediterranean ambitions.

 Madam President, following this terrible earthquake that has plunged China and the entire world into mourning, the authorities have played the game of transparency for the first time and responded to the drama with large-scale emergency deployment, which the EU and the entire international community are doing their best to sustain. However, we have all heard sharp criticism in China of the poor quality of buildings, especially the most recent structures and public locations such as schools, which have led to the disappearance of thousands of schoolchildren, with very few rescued. This disaster is showing up the poor quality of building work in the country, a sensitive issue in China where millions of people have been expropriated in the larger cities in the run-up to decisive events such as the Olympic Games. Other worrying matters, already mentioned, loom over this drama: the strength of hydroelectric facilities such as the concrete dam at Zipingpu makes us fear the worst for the 600 000 people living downstream. The earthquake also caused damage to 391 reservoirs. As yet there is little information available on the plutonium-enrichment facilities in the north-east of Sichuan province, despite their close proximity to the epicentre, and this is likewise extremely disturbing. Would it not be a good idea to carry out an independent international assessment on such vital issues, since the Chinese are still showing a certain amount of opacity and any official statements are all reassurance?

 Mr President, the reports put forward are very precise and well documented. They give a convincing indication, I believe, of Parliament’s current ability to evaluate EU policy on human rights and democracy. Guidelines, dialogues and consultations, action plans, the human rights clause, election observation missions: these instruments are evaluated thoroughly and the progress that still needs to be made is also clearly identified, whether it is by devising human rights strategies for each country or precise indicators to evaluate situations, or asking Parliament to initiate appropriate measures for the implementation of the human rights clause. These objectives are, I believe, well known both to the Commission and to the Council, and will remain on the agenda for our discussions. Specific demands are also addressed to the Member States. In particular, we deplore the fact that a large number of international conventions and additional protocols have still not been ratified by many of them: the Convention on the Protection of the Rights of All Migrant Workers and Members of their Families; the Optional Protocol to the Convention Against Torture; the International Convention for the Protection of All Persons from Enforced Disappearance; and other instruments, such as ILO Convention 169. Ratifying them would honour the Member States and the EU as a whole. There are also some even more difficult, and recurrent, issues that the international situation unfailingly places at the forefront of our concerns: issues concerning a comprehensive, integrated approach to human rights in all EU policies. Yes, the asylum and immigration policy being pursued by the EU and the Member States leads to massive human rights violations, particularly at our external borders. Yes, large European companies turn a blind eye to direct attacks on employment law or the right to a healthy environment, or are even the cause of them. The EU should be moving towards a legislative framework that fosters compatibility in its activities and respect for human rights. Yes, the food crisis calls our agricultural and energy policies into question. Yes, once again, the impact of climate change on human rights is obvious. The rights to life, health, housing and food are at the top of the list of violations. Our ambition is a comprehensive, integrated policy. Work on implementing the Treaty of Lisbon has begun. It will mark an additional step in our commitment to human rights. This commitment needs to be guaranteed by more substantial and coherent organisation and resources when it comes to human rights. The European External Action Service should, for example, include a centre focusing on the cross-cutting nature of human rights. The European Parliament itself should take the plunge. A fully functional parliamentary body is highly desirable for this purpose.

Mr President, as has just been pointed out, the humanitarian and human rights situation in Burma is deteriorating and it is up to the next General Affairs and External Relations Council to acknowledge this loud and clear and to redefine the action implemented under the European policy. What seemed initially to be a positive sign, the famous constitutional reform, quickly became an utterly Machiavellian project. The presence of military personnel in government is thus going to be included formally in the constitution, in violation of all international standards and in the absence of any observers, while all those who oppose the current regime are excluded from electoral representation. This is a complete farce and it will plunge Burma even further under the junta’s iron rule. It has to be said that this represents a failure of the inclusive strategy, within Burma itself and at regional level, implemented by the European Union and the United Nations. Our Envoy has not even managed to set foot in Burma. Today our double-sided strategy – sanctions/incentives – therefore has to become more effective and more focused. In other words, we need better, more insightful and more regular implementation of the criteria already laid down in accordance with the stated objectives. Our financial measures must isolate completely the companies that are linked to the junta or that, in one way or another, help to fund it, as well as the people in power who can swan off to other countries to go shopping and send their children to schools abroad. The same applies to the banking sanctions imposed on them, which at present do not prohibit transfers via European banks. As far as ASEAN is concerned, the negotiations on the free trade agreement must be seen as an opportunity to ensure that the neighbouring states refrain from implementing any strategy that might offset the sanctions against Burma. The second aspect relates to incentives. At the same time, we must support the life blood of the country: on a humanitarian level, which goes with saying of course, but also on a political level. That means publicly condemning the Burmese authorities, denouncing the content of the referendum and the procedures used, and promoting with conviction the rule of law and fundamental freedoms via EIDHR projects. It also means supporting and protecting human rights activities, combating the impressment of children into armed factions and protecting children from violence.

 Mr President, on the eve of the Seventh Human Rights Council, Parliament wishes to send a message of support, vigilance and mobilisation. The Council is the only international body that actually fights human rights violations, and particularly that responds to emergencies, to human rights crises, but also that works long term with the special rapporteurs and in an interactive dialogue with NGOs. The Council is unique and is at a difficult turning point in its history. One year will not be enough to establish its effectiveness. On the other hand, it may be enough to discredit it, and there have been many attempts to weaken and divert it, as we know. I would first like to mention the situation of Mrs Sigma Huda, Special Rapporteur on trafficking in persons. She is in prison in deplorable conditions in Bangladesh. Next, concerning these same special rapporteurs, the Advisory Committee’s proposals will finally be decided by the President as a last resort. That gives you an idea of just how important his role is, and I would like to salute the excellence of the work done by President Costea, and at the same time draw your attention to the fact that he will be replaced in June. That is why the EU has to remain attentive and proactive. Its action is decisive. We saw it in Gaza. The EU’s abstention waters down the message considerably, and weakens the Council itself. However, when the EU takes the initiative of a special session and throws its whole weight behind it, the Council grows and achieves results. To do this, our Member States need to strengthen their transregional alliances to convince others and prevent any block reaction that would send the Council back into the throes of political contingencies. We therefore call upon our governments to step up their efforts and set an example. Set an example by appointing an independent expert when they participate in the assessment of another government as part of the UPR and by themselves being open to criticism and self-criticism, and set an example for the election of new members. A standing invitation to the special procedures should be a criterion of prime importance for EU Member States.

Mr President, on Friday, 11 January I was refused access to the Lille-Lesquin Detention Centre for foreigners. My visit was part of the European Action Week against the detention of foreigners in Europe. Mr President, in July 2003, following, in fact, a request by the then President of our Parliament and Vice-President Onesta, the French authorities were obliged to stipulate that the rules that apply to visits by Members of the French Parliament and Senators also apply to Members of the European Parliament. I would therefore ask you, Mr President, to speak to the French authorities once again to ensure that the commitments they made at that time are fully respected and, in particular, that Members of the European Parliament are treated in the same way as Members of the French Parliament. This is all the more pertinent as the Members of this Parliament are currently examining a proposal for a directive on the return of third-country nationals, which could have very serious consequences for the detention of foreigners. I would add that unannounced visits to detention centres are aimed at preventing ill-treatment, which generally goes unpunished in France, as indicated in the most recent report by the Committee for the Prevention of Torture.

Madam President, we are talking today to Commissioner Ferrero-Waldner, and that is welcome. However, at the 10th EU-China summit in Beijing on 28 November, the European Union was represented by its President, by the Trade Commissioner and by the Economic and Monetary Affairs Commissioner. It is true that, since 2000, trade between the European Union and China has increased by 150%; it is also true that it has become much harder to produce statistics on the deteriorating human rights situation in China. There is nothing taboo about discussing human rights issues at the same time as trade issues. There is an obvious link between them, for example in relation to the freedom to join a trade union, and the ability of workers in China to mobilise and demand better working conditions. The general attitude we encounter is deplorable, all the more so because its effect is to make us waste time: the decision taken in 2001 promised a new openness in China and progress on human rights and democracy; the Chinese people are waiting for that promise to be kept and they are looking to us. They have been disappointed in their hope that openness would result from China’s staging the Olympic Games, and the sense of disappointment is bitter. Not only has the run-up to the Games so far brought harsher repression but – even more regrettably – the organisation of the Games has itself had unforeseen effects and has been used as a pretext for serious human rights violations. I am thinking here of the cases of forced expropriation and of the exploitation of migrant labour. All this may not be surprising, for the dissident Hu Jia informs us that the head of security in Beijing is also the person in charge of organising the Olympic Games there. Perhaps we shall get round to expressing surprise or even dismay about that state of affairs when the intimidation and repression of foreign journalists – which has already begun – becomes even more drastic, for they are already being prevented from working. The arrest of two Agence France-Presse journalists on 12 September, for example, shows that the rules introduced in January 2007 are being applied only patchily and only insofar as the persons concerned cause no embarrassment to the regime. The undertakings given by China are a dead letter; indeed, it is falling so far short of its commitments that it has resorted to compiling blacklists. There is currently a blacklist of 42 categories of people regarded as persona non grata
 during the Olympic Games, ranging from the Dalaï Lama to followers of Falun Gong and including dissidents. In January this year, negotiations began on a new EU-China framework agreement. That is welcome because a new agreement also means a new ‘human rights and democracy’ clause. It creates fresh scope for discussing human rights concerns with the Chinese authorities. However, 2007 was also the year that saw the cancellation of a legal seminar to prepare for the human rights dialogue because the Chinese authorities refused to allow two particular NGOs to participate – one of them the well-known organisation represented by human rights campaigner Sharon Hom. It was certainly salutary to find the Union taking a firm stand on that occasion. At the same time, of course, we have to ask whether seminars like this can continue. Our position is that the two things must not be mutually exclusive. It is very important to go on holding legal seminars. Equally, however, we cannot permit the Chinese authorities to dictate who may take part in them.

 Mr President, I welcome this annual report. It is an important piece of work providing us with a comprehensive view of the initiatives taken over one year and two presidencies to implement EU policy on human rights. It is obviously no mean feat: it is a practical tool and a reference document. For all that, I feel Mrs Andrikienė is right. The report lacks a certain amount of objective appraisal, analysis and critical spirit, and as it does not draw any conclusions from the issues it considers, it lacks any recommendations. The successes or failures of this policy are not sufficiently developed in the report. That, I hope, and I feel sure this will be the case, will be the work of Members in the report to be drawn up by Parliament in the spring: their work must move in this direction. There are also some disturbing silences in this report. As Mrs Ludford mentioned, the section on human rights in relation to the fight against terrorism fortunately concludes with a reference to Parliament’s work on CIA flights and extraordinary renditions, but it says nothing about the Council’s lack of action in pursuing inquiries, charges against those responsible, and even less about compensation for the victims unjustly transferred, imprisoned or tortured. Likewise, the section on asylum and migration says nothing about the mass violations of the rights of migrants; no assessment is made of the implementation of agreements for a series of readmissions, nothing on the quasi-militarised administration of borders, nothing on the thousands of people who die trying to reach our coasts, although the work of Members is extensive and regular on these issues. Nor, on reading this report, can one understand the reasons why our Member States have placed themselves in an extremely embarrassing position vis-à-vis our partners and vis-à-vis international law by refusing outright to ratify the Convention on migrant workers and their families. On these issues our internal policy has consequences on human rights outside our borders. I welcome the adoption of the Charter of Fundamental Rights which will help us take a much wiser look at ourselves, including Great Britain and Poland. Analysis of our successes could also be useful for inspiring our future strategies. Mrs Ferrero-Waldner is right: the decisive role of the EU in the UN Human Rights Council’s adoption of promising and demanding work mechanisms, such as the recent adoption of a resolution calling for a moratorium on the death penalty, must be analysed. An active presidency, a mobilised Council, a European Parliament on the offensive and tenacious civil organisations are helping fashion Europe as an effective world player: this is very good and encouraging news.

 Madam President, I dare not think what the expressions on the faces of my PPE fellow Members would be if they found out that a resolution on Muslim communities in Europe had been adopted by the Gulf States or by ASEAN. It would be felt as a nasty shock, a sign of aggression, an unacceptable intrusion by a religious authority in a non-EU country into relations between our Member States and religious minorities. Do not do unto others what you would not have them do unto you is also a Christian precept. Seriously, would such a resolution be perceived as a call for tolerance and intercultural and religious dialogue? Certainly not! The European Union, so proud of its values, would be well advised to demonstrate on these ultra-sensitive issues a modicum of discernment and respect for international conventions. To tackle violations of the rights of people from religious minorities, to condemn the murder of Christians or restrictions on freedom to worship, we have a choice between two equally well-founded approaches. The first is to talk to a country, on the basis of its international commitments and the agreements between us, and ask it to investigate, try those responsible, and ensure the rights of religious minorities are respected, and that is what we do here regularly. The second approach is that taken by the United Nations, through a resolution tabled by 12 countries and by all the EU states, concerning the elimination of all forms of intolerance and discrimination based on religion, beliefs, and freedom of thought and conscience because, in international law – and this is very valuable – they are linked. An individual’s rights to belief, to religion, to thought and to conscience are interdependent. What will we be doing today if we adopt this unacceptable text you are proposing? We will be ignoring the work being done by our Member States at the United Nations and taking a different approach which is likely to encourage certain countries to exploit religious issues in their international relations. We will be going against the balanced approach recommended, for example, by Mrs Jahangir, United Nations Special Rapporteur, currently under house arrest in Pakistan, and at the end of the day we will also be making the situation of religious minorities throughout the world, including Christians, more fragile. Once again, together with experts working on religious freedom, such as Christian Solidarity Worldwide, I say that this resolution simply increases the danger for those we want to protect.

 Madam President, the aim of this resolution is simple: it is to tell the truth. That is what the Uzbek people and human rights activists are asking us to do. The urgency derives from the assassinations of journalists and dissidents that have occurred over the last few months, and from the conclusions of the Council on 15 October, which were wrongly presented as a diplomatic victory by President Karimov. The important fact is that the sanctions have been extended for 12 months because no investigation has been carried out into the Andijan massacre and the meetings of experts on the matter have not produced any result. As regards the lifting of visa bans for six months, we agree that the visa bans should automatically be renewed if the excellent criteria introduced – the visits by United Nations special rapporteurs, for example – are not met within six months. On the other hand, we are not happy with the conclusions on the alleged progress made on human rights. For example, the abolition of the death penalty has still not actually come about, and the EU-Uzbekistan dialogue on human rights is suspended. Finally, in this resolution, we condemn the assassination of several independent journalists and dissidents, and demand that serious and impartial investigations are conducted. I am concerned about the intentions of the PPE and the UEN. They are proposing to go further than all the Member States by interpreting the Council’s conclusions not only as a suspension of the visa bans but actually as removal of the visas altogether. Their paragraph 3 states that the ineffectiveness of the sanctions is an encouragement to the Uzbek regime, which makes no sense either intellectually or politically. The text does not even mention the 13 human rights activists whose immediate release President Pöttering demanded by letter. Finally, my last point is that paragraph 9 mentions the difficult situation of Human Rights Watch. That is fine, but the organisation made it known clearly that it did not want to be mentioned in a resolution that was technically incorrect and as harmful for human rights activists as for the Uzbek people and that in the end, as everyone realises, would be used as a propaganda tool by the dictator, President Karimov. Consequently, I am asking the MEPs from the PPE and UEN to subscribe to the serious attitude we need to adopt on this matter and with regard to the Uzbek people, and support our motion for a resolution, which says nothing more than the truth about the human rights situation in Uzbekistan.

Mr President, as everyone has said, including those speaking this morning, migration is a priority for the European Union and for Euromed relations. It is a major issue for those people who are often forced to leave a homeland that has been devastated by poverty, desertification, floods, war and so on. Will the Euromed Ministerial Conference be equal to the task? Nothing could be less sure. The preparatory documents are hopelessly lacking in substance. This is hardly surprising since we know that none of the organisations on the ground – including those that are actually confronted every day with the situation facing migrants who are either in transit, aimlessly wandering or at risk of their life afloat on the Mediterranean – not a single one of them has been involved in the preparations, not even the HCR. Preconclusions mean turning a blind eye to the right of asylum, to the illegal detention of migrants and the respect for their rights, whether they happen to be legitimate or not, to the unacceptable violence to which they are subjected, especially women migrants, to the rights of minors and to the criminalisation of giving aid to migrants and migrant families. This blindness is total when it comes to meeting the Union’s international commitments and the agreements that have to implemented or ratified: it is the Geneva Convention for some, and for others, which means all the countries of the European Union, it is the Convention on the Protection of the Rights of Migrant Workers and their Families. Where do we really hope we are going with such a Euro-Mediterranean policy, with such a clear absence of demands when it comes to nations’ shared rights and obligations? Where is the risk? The risk is that of having a smoke-screen of handpicked legal migrations behind which we find sustained and massive rights’ violations for all the others. If it is trying to spare the more sensitive souls by giving up on a really ambitious policy then the conference is doing its best to be a real waste of time. From the word go it would provide pre-justification for the proliferation of bilateral agreements of the Italy-Libya kind, signed on the sly, which violate the principle of the withholding of removal and do so with complete impunity. It is not too late to act. Invite the HCR, invite a representative from the NGOs, start out again with the initial document put forward by the countries of the southern Mediterranean, which is much more ambitious, and the conference may just turn out to be a positive and significant milestone.

Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, let us be clear! The decision we took yesterday will be interpreted – and already has been in fact – by the Russian authorities as a great success: no resolution, no message. That is a real bonus following the rejection of an official human rights delegation from the European Parliament. Russian society is, more than ever, hostage to a propagandist press and is retreating into dangerous nationalism. Today in Russia violence based on fear prevails while racism and xenophobia are taking hold. The word ‘independent’ can no longer be used. ‘Independent’ human rights activists, journalists or political opponents are automatically labelled ‘enemies of the regime’. A law adopted in 2007 is officially devoted to them. Under the guise of combating extremism, it actually gives the authorities complete freedom in this unfair fight. As Marie Mendras told us yesterday, this climate of permanent violation of human rights is not spurring the people there into action. Mr Putin’s gamble has thus paid off: he has managed to convince his fellow citizens that Russia has its own special rules when it comes to democracy and human rights. With such a belief, it is no surprise whatsoever that Russia is still the last member of the Council of Europe not to have ratified Protocol 14. This is for Putin a godsend, a blessing. It means that he does not have to comply with the rulings and can prevent the cases from going anywhere, particularly those of tortured Chechens. In light of this situation, it would be naive to think that free and transparent elections will take place in Russia on 2 December. Given the circumstances, are they not really just a plebiscite for or against Vladimir Putin? Without any amendment to the Constitution, he will continue to have power over all political, economic, financial, administrative, judicial and security matters. On the eve of the EU-Russia Summit, I am calling on the Council and the Commission to include human rights at the highest political level. It is vital that they play a key role, whether discussing the future agreement, Kosovo or energy. That is what Russian democrats ask of us. They simply say: ‘Continue to talk about them, continue to tell the truth’. At least we are not risking our lives when doing so.

 Mr President, at a time when the crossing points into the Gaza Strip are closed and are controlled by the Israeli army, at a time when murderous incursions are being conducted there on a daily basis, at a time when the number of settlers in the occupied territories is continuing to grow, at a time when, in violation of international law, the construction of the wall and security surveillance are continuing, within these very walls, in the European Parliament, there are still people who would deny Israel’s status as an occupying power. It is shocking! Israel is an occupying power, and as such has obligations under the Geneva Conventions and, in particular, must not use collective punishment under any circumstances. We would be well advised to ensure that Israel meets its obligations instead of sending disastrous signals, as we did for example by suspending funding for the fuel supply for the power station in Gaza. The crocodile tears we have shed over the divisions between Palestinians are really inappropriate after the European Union was incapable of supporting Mahmoud Abbas’ efforts to co-opt the pragmatic wing of Hamas. Can you imagine anything worse? Playing Ramallah off against Gaza? Deciding who are the good Palestinians and helping them to get rid of the bad? Who can believe in a lasting solution if the political and territorial unity of Palestine is not guaranteed? Who can believe that peace for the Israelis and Palestinians will be built through a policy that in fact leads to the radicalisation of the people of Israel and of Palestine? The humanitarian situation in Gaza breaches all the standards of human dignity. The lifting of the blockade of the Gaza Strip needs to be secured as quickly as possible. Due pressure needs to be exerted on Israel. This question cannot remain a taboo anymore and I am asking you, the Council and the Commission, what measures you intend to take in order to encourage the lifting of the blockade and to force Israel to comply with its obligations and commitments. I am asking you what you intend to do to make Israel give up its plans to cut the West Bank in two by linking Jericho with East Jerusalem, a month before the international conference. (Applause)

Mr President, in proposing legal channels of immigration, an idea that is essentially motivated by Europe’s economic needs, which are for the most part insensitive to the real needs of those who live in the southern parts of the Union, you are in fact deciding not so much on the number of migrants coming to Europe but rather on those among them who may enter our territory legally. What about the others, however? For them there only remains the nightmare voyage. Prevented from leaving their country of birth, intercepted at sea, unofficial channels, detention, rescue or drowning – and I would like to hear you say and say again that rescuing people at sea is a universal and fundamental duty, witness the case of the seven Tunisian fishermen, and that it is the very minimum that we should expect – and then possibly forced repatriation, endless wandering in hostile transit countries, plus serious violations of human rights and so on. As the Commissioner responsible for justice, freedom and security, ensuring respect for human rights ought to be your main concern – as it is ours – and your powers in this area are very great indeed, in fact as we all know they are immense. When Chechen nationals are refused asylum in Slovakia, and are expelled back to Russia via Ukraine, how can you guarantee that they will not be victims of maltreatment? What has been the outcome of the initial agreements on readmission that the EU has negotiated in this area? How can we guarantee that there will be no repression when we unceremoniously return people in this way? When Frontex patrols intercept boats full of migrants at sea how do you ensure that those on board are effectively able to apply for asylum and that the patrols in question will treat minors in a proper manner, and with their best interests in mind, as required under international law? In closing may I just ask you to explain clearly why you do not have a proactive policy requiring Member States to ratify the International Convention on the rights of migrant workers and their families?

 Mr President, Amnesty International has set the tone of our debate in a statement issued today. It says, in effect, that Germany is refusing to demand the extradition of certain US citizens, members of the CIA, who are suspected of having organised the abduction and detention of Mr Khaled-el-Masri, and of subsequently having tortured him. Restrained by a political decision, the legal system therefore does not have the wherewithal to dispense justice in cases involving the alleged breach of human rights, committed in the name of the fight against terrorism. This is precisely the situation that is at the heart of this debate. Mr President-in-Office of the Council, you tell us things and you make hypothetical statements such as: ‘the fight against terrorism has to be conducted with respect for basic human rights’. We agree with you. However, the debate we are having today shows that the real facts have now been confirmed: Member States of the European Union have been complicit in the programme of secret detention and return that has been set up within the territory of the European Union by the CIA and in doing so have broken the law. This has now been proven. The question that we are now asking is this: what initiatives are you now going to take? What lessons are you going to learn from this situation? When are you going to condemn these illegal activities in clear terms and in the name of the Council? When are you going to start putting pressure on Member States to provide full and accurate details of what has been going on to the national parliaments and to the Members of this House? When are you going to get Member States to reject the whole business of giving diplomatic assurances? I welcome the announcement by Commissioner Frattini that there is to be a report on the effectiveness of anti-terrorism measures and on respect for human rights. I believe that Parliament will be very interested in receiving this report and I look forward very much to being able to discuss it with you. I would like to invite you here and now to such a debate.

 Madam President, the number of abolitionist countries, or countries where a moratorium has been introduced, is growing each year. People are wavering, even in States that still maintain the death penalty, such as the US, and coalitions are forming in Muslim countries. Every day, steps are taken to avoid executions. Homosexuality is still punishable by death in several countries and, unfortunately, the current European climate is a reminder that this remains a very difficult battle. On the moratorium and the UN General Assembly, Parliament asks you, President-in-Office of the Council, for the third time this year, and in the most solemn way: we must do our utmost to obtain a resolution from the UN General Assembly as soon as possible and by the end of the year, with a view to a moratorium and a strategy for abolition. I think we are all saying the same thing here: it is your move. On the European Day against the Death Penalty, how do we explain why we have not said a word about the situation in Europe today? How is it conceivable that a country can use this issue for political purposes, remaining out of step with the rest of Europe, with Article 2 of the Charter of Fundamental Rights, and out of step with perhaps the most longstanding common objectives of its external policy? The institutions of the European Union, and you, as President-in-Office of the Council, cannot tolerate this situation. The World Day against the Death Penalty is on 10 October. The European Parliament will be meeting in a part-session in Brussels. It is vital for Parliament to mark this event as solemnly and as resolutely as possible.

Madam President, as I believe Mrs Valenciano has shown very clearly in her excellent report, we are overflowing with concrete proposals that will certainly be very useful to the Portuguese Presidency, as it has stated its aim to achieve tangible results on human rights and democracy. We have for some time been calling for greater coherence, transparency and results in our discussions with third countries, jointly with the Commission and the Council. All that remains is actually to go from words to action. I am convinced that you know as well as I do that all it takes is organisation to make human rights dialogues more effective, beyond their diversity. Firstly, this means setting up clear, public objectives assigned to each dialogue so that a coherent, shared strategy, appropriated at the highest level, emerges. Secondly, it means setting up indicators to allow proper evaluation of the results achieved by a dialogue and informing MEPs of them so that, for example when a delegation visits the country, they can check what progress has been made and discuss it with civil society and human rights activists, to be better able to question their partners on the commitments made within the framework of the dialogue. On this score, we are still waiting to be informed of the indicators that should be used to evaluate the dialogue recently established with Uzbekistan. Thirdly, it means guaranteeing that human rights are taken into account in all the EU’s external policies, including trade policy, migration policy and the fight against terrorism. It is our credibility in talking about human rights that is at stake here. For example, can anyone explain how we can currently be discussing the implementation of guidelines against torture with Jordan in the Subcommittee on Human Rights, the first subcommittee to be set up under the neighbourhood policy, today held up as a model, when we know that European Member States have covered up the subcontracting of torture by the CIA? How can we be discussing torture and the fight against it in this subcommittee? Our first job as MEPs is to evaluate the pertinence of the EU’s action, and to do this, you can count on the delegations, the committees and the whole Parliament, which will continue to fight for its application every step of the way, whether it means launching, reorientating or, if necessary, stopping a dialogue.

Mr President, I wish to inform you of the trial currently being held in Agrigente, Sicily of seven Tunisian fishermen accused of aiding illegal immigration, even though on 8 August they rescued 44 people, including 11 women, two of whom were pregnant, and two children. They are now accused of aiding illegal immigration, and this is happening on European soil. I feel that the crime of solidarity that is now taking place, as this trial demonstrates, ought to be condemned by Parliament. A delegation is also due to travel to Agrigente this Friday, and I can only encourage the Members and their leader, you, Mr President, to voice their support for these seven Tunisian fishermen.

Mr President, you have appealed, Mr Antunes, together with nine of your colleagues, for a new approach in Palestine. That is a good starting point. The report by Mr de Soto, the United Nations Special Coordinator, roundly criticises the strategy of the Quartet, and does little for the reputation of the Union itself. The Union’s strategy has not been able to encourage the normalisation of Hamas in the political arena, or Israel’s compliance with its international obligations, or the Palestinians’ efforts towards unity. The disaster, today, is human; it is economic and social; it is political. What new approach should be developed, then? The European Union, Commissioner, is not a charity. It must commit itself politically and, in the first place, offer a credible prospect of the conflict’s being resolved once and for all. The potential of the peace plan presented by the Arab League must be totally exploited to this end. The Union must commit itself to an international peace conference involving all the parties. It must do so resolutely, even if it means taking the Quartet firmly by the hand. Every channel must be used by the Union in order to put the Israeli authorities in a position to meet their international obligations and to obtain tangible results in the field of law, for the benefit of Palestine’s civilian population. The Union should assume its responsibilities at the Rafah border crossing and denounce, if need be publicly, the obstacles preventing it from carrying out its control mission. The blockade on the Gaza Strip, which creates conditions conducive to an explosion in violence and which has been followed by a show of strength by Hamas, must be lifted. The movement of persons and goods, between Gaza and the West Bank, and between Gaza and Israel, must be re-established. I will conclude, Mr President, by saying that, in a case such as this, the Union should propose to its partners that they examine the appropriateness of having an international force, so that peace is given every chance.

Mr President, the Klich-Sakalas report has the merit of underlining the absolute necessity of ensuring the protection of human rights in the implementation of the Area of Freedom, Security and Justice. Nonetheless, tomorrow, at voting time, I shall oppose the amendments aimed at deleting all reference to the illegal detention and transportation of alleged terrorists in European Union territory, and I shall ask my fellow Members to do the same. Today we are celebrating World Refugee Day and I remember the remarks made, right here, by Kofi Annan, describing as shameful the European Union’s policy in relation to asylum and immigration. What has changed since? Despite the conflicts that mark out the world, the European Union accepts fewer and fewer refugees. The number of asylum seekers in the EU has reduced by half since the 1990s. Today, for example, the rate of acceptance of asylum applications for people from Darfur is incredibly low. The European Union also refuses to accept its responsibilities in relation to Iraqi refugees. More than four million Iraqis are today forced to move and, in spite of that, the German Presidency has stated that Member States do not wish to take part in a resettlement programme for refugees. The heated negotiations on readmission agreements obliging third countries to admit on their territory any person in transit there causes, as you know, disastrous humanitarian situations and serious violations of the right to international protection and of the principle of non-refoulement. These agreements transfer to third countries responsibilities that they are not generally capable of assuming. This ‘forced march’ policy discredits in part the efforts made in other respects for the protection of fundamental rights in third countries. The European Commission ought to make clear and practical proposals to get away from this schizophrenia. A transparent monitoring procedure for these agreements needs to be set up; effective recourse in the event of violation of rights following refusal of entry should be put in place. The Commission could also appoint, within its Frontex teams, people with special training in human rights and humanitarian law to properly ensure that international commitments and conventions are being observed.

Madam President, I unreservedly join with those who have congratulated Mr Coveney. He has produced an outstanding piece of work. His report does not catalogue the violations in the world, as you have seen. He makes a genuine effort to evaluate the human rights and democracy policy implemented by the European Union, and I would really emphasise the added value of such an analysis when it comes to successfully increasing the consistency and impact of our actions. I also welcome the action announced by the Council Presidency as that with which it intends to follow up this report. In the light of this, Parliament believes that its participation, in one form or another, in the dialogue on human rights and its involvement in the implementation of the guidelines are crucial to making the dialogue and the guidelines more effective. I note, moreover, that the effectiveness of the guidelines is harmed by the fact that Union missions in some countries are at times still unaware of them. It therefore remains important – imperative – to inform the missions and to enlist their support, so that maximum use is made of these guidelines. I should like to emphasise, as you have all done, the concerns regarding the United Nations Commission for Human Rights, at a time when a highly promising reform ought to materialise, enabling the United Nations to have a credible, effective body with which to protect human rights and democracy. Too many States that are members of the Human Rights Commission are operating along the wrong lines, working as they are to weaken the creative scope and independence of the special procedures, and are promoting a partisan vision. The Union must do all it can - and we support you in this regard - to establish the prestige of this international body, the only one that can still hear the complaints of the world’s victims of human rights violations. This report also enables me to emphasise our commitment towards human rights defenders. The new measures contained within the EIDHR (European Initiative for Democracy and Human Rights) will be an opportunity for the Union to formalise its action by making it possible for human rights defenders quickly to receive support and protection in emergency situations.

Madam President, featuring among the key aspects of the Euromed relations, and of all the resolutions and declarations relating thereto, are the Middle East peace process, the fight against terrorism, cooperation in the fields of asylum and immigration policy and the promotion of democracy and of human rights. But how long is the road and wide the gulf between the declarations and modest results! In the Middle East, the European Union has great difficulty in supporting the genuinely impartial application of international law. The rhetoric developed thus far by the European Union regarding respect for fundamental rights in the fight against terrorism has been in a bad way since the Fava report on immigration. The European Union policy has the very immediate effect of imprisoning migrants and refugees in their area of origin or of transit, in violation of their fundamental rights. What is more, the mediocre performance in the areas of democracy and of human rights clashes each day with the names of the human rights defenders – journalists, political opponents and even prisoners of conscience or trade unionists – who are rotting in prison. In Tunisia, where the Euro-Mediterranean Parliamentary Assembly, the EMPA, will meet for its plenary session, all of the projects funded by the European Union to help civil society are on hold. Not a single journalist can express himself freely. The Tunisian Human Rights League, the union of journalists and other associations are still banned from holding their congresses. Mr Abou, a lawyer and human rights activist whose release we were demanding as far back as June 2006, has just begun his third year in prison. Ladies and gentlemen, we know that it is the participation of civil societies in the process and the democratic and parliamentary monitoring of the Euro-Mediterranean policies that are key to the revival of a virtuous dynamic, of a dynamic for peace, and of a dynamic for sustainable development and for human rights. The Euromed parliamentary assembly must therefore do everything it can to support, promote and involve networks and actors from civil society in its work and to develop a real independent, autonomous capacity of governments, a capacity to assess, to spearhead and to make proposals within the framework of the Euro-Mediterranean policy.

 Mr President, we would ask you to add to paragraph 2, after ‘the universal moratorium on executions’, the phrase ‘with a view to the universal abolition of the death penalty’.
 Hélène Flautre,  
on behalf of the Verts/ALE Group.
 – (FR)
 Madam President, last week, during the debate on the Benghazi case, we stated our total opposition to the death penalty under any circumstances. It is now important to reaffirm this principle, which is enshrined in Article 2 of the Charter of Fundamental Rights. The Union has always advocated the abolition of the death penalty, and has even gone so far as to make it a condition of accession and a key principle of its foreign policy. Moreover, guidelines were adopted in 1998, and civil society projects are regularly funded under the European Initiative for Democracy and Human Rights. This effort has been rewarded: the number of executions in the United States has gone down, and in countries like Mexico, Liberia, the Philippines and Moldova, the death penalty has been abolished. The same is not true everywhere, however. Some US States have extended the scope of the death penalty to other crimes apart from murder; in Singapore, a person is still automatically sentenced to death for carrying 15 grams of heroin, and China still executes more people than any other country. In addition, there are countries like Iraq and Afghanistan, which have reinstated the death penalty. Peru almost did likewise in the name of combating terrorism, but fortunately this did not happen. Against this backdrop and ahead of the developing world congress [against the death penalty], the EU must be extra vigilant. The international groundswell of opinion in favour of a universal moratorium on the death penalty should be addressed within the framework of a pro-abolition policy. Ensuring the ratification of the second protocol to the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights aimed at abolishing the death penalty should therefore be one of the Union’s priorities. It is crucial that France, Latvia and Poland, which have yet to ratify the protocol, do so at the earliest opportunity.

 Ladies and gentlemen, certain terms concerning the Libyan authorities need to be corrected. We have been somewhat European in our choice of words. We should therefore replace ‘President Gaddafi’ by ‘Colonel Gaddafi’. I should also like to point out that in paragraph 12 ‘Popular Assembly’ should be replaced by ‘General People’s Congress’ because that is the right name, and ‘government’ by ‘General People’s Committee’. One needs to be precise when referring to the Libyan authorities.
 Hélène Flautre,

Madam President, I should like to congratulate you on your election. In this debate, I should like to begin by pointing out the European Union’s stance against the death penalty and this, in all circumstances, whether it be in the case of the Benghazi medical personnel, of Saddam Hussein, of the political opponents in China or even of all the unknown persons about whom less is said, especially in the United States. The right to life is a fundamental, essential right to human dignity, and that is why the abolition of the death penalty is one of the conditions for accession to the European Union and why it is a priority for the external action of the Union, which has developed specific guidelines along these lines. The situation of the Benghazi medical personnel is tragic; it is a tragedy that affects families and children infected by the AIDS virus. It is therefore crucial for the European Union to continue to help implement its action plan so that it can come to the aid of the victims and their families. However, is there any need to add horror to the tragedy? The Palestinian doctor and the Bulgarian nurses who have been in prison for more than seven years now and who have been going through non-stop hell since their arrest did not commit this crime. Countless independent analyses have proved beyond any shadow of a doubt that they did not do it, and their so-called confessions were extracted by torture, as everyone knows. The Benghazi medical team is therefore being held hostage by a shameful form of bargaining, and it is time for this travesty of justice to end. The European Union’s actions have not yet succeeded in getting the entire medical team out of this hell, and we ought perhaps now to question the European Union’s relations with the Libyan authorities. Indeed, since we are talking about the Benghazi case, everyone agrees that Libya is not a democratic country, that its judiciary is not independent, that torture is commonplace and that rights are flouted there. However, as soon as we talk about the management of migratory flows, it is as though all of that were no longer true. Speeches become sugary, calling on Libya to continue on the road to democracy and giving the impression that people’s rights could be respected there. Do you not believe that, if this matter is to have a happy ending, there needs to be a policy for promoting human rights and democracy that is credible, coherent, free of any double standards and implemented at every level? That is, I believe, the condition for success.

Mr President, as you know, for we Greens it is essential that we implement a genuine European transport policy leading to a modal transfer from the roads to rail. Road traffic creates 25% of greenhouse gas emissions, and this is therefore a significant challenge. We should be asking ourselves the following question: is opening up to competition, specifically in passenger transport by rail, going to respond to that challenge? On the contrary, I believe that the proposals contained in the Jarzembowski report are in danger of leading to a deterioration of the service for users. Fares, ticketing, information on timetables, management of connections: how are users going to know how to make the most of the different services offered by the rail companies? We can expect the less profitable lines, which play a fundamental role in terms of social and territorial cohesion, to be abandoned. We can also expect increased pressure on the working conditions of railway personnel, as is happening in the case of low-cost airlines in the aviation sector, and fierce competition for the most profitable slots, without this having any effect on the final number of passengers transported. In order to strengthen the railways, we need a genuine European commitment to funding the modernisation of infrastructures, the obsolete nature of which is a major obstacle to their development. We also need to overcome the obstacles to interoperability and to adopt – and this is crucial – a tax system which genuinely penalises the most polluting forms of transport, such as a tax on kerosene or the internalisation of environmental costs for road transport. Liberalisation is by no means the only way to Europeanise transport policies.

Mr President, I would like to say briefly that I hope that we are on the point of adopting, by a large majority, this European instrument for promoting democracy and human rights, because it is the only instrument enabling us to support projects for promoting democracy in third countries, without the support of the governments, and it is therefore the only instrument that can provide a response to the issues that have just been raised by Mr Milinkievitch. How can we support free media, how can we support independent civil society, how can we defend and protect the defenders of human rights in third countries, without the support of governments? The answer is by means of this instrument. (Applause)

Mr President, you are indeed not mistaken. This is an oral amendment to Amendment 147 which, in order to conform precisely to the terms negotiated with the Council, is intended to replace the phrase ‘including rights of migrants, asylum seekers and internally displaced persons’ with ‘including migrants’ enjoyment of human rights, rights of asylum seekers and internally displaced persons’.

Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, since the month of September my co-rapporteur and I have been negotiating with the Council and the Commission with a view to gaining acceptance for Parliament's position on the European financing instrument for the promotion of democracy and human rights worldwide. These negotiations have now been concluded, and, as has just been said, the Council adopted a common position last week based on a compromise text. This draft, much of which we had previously introduced in the form of amendments, satisfies most of Parliament's requirements. It stipulates that the use of the instrument does not depend on the consent of host governments. It permits the funding of non-registered organisations. It includes a flexible mechanism for the provision of direct support to human-rights activists who face imminent danger. This new mechanism should greatly enhance the effectiveness of our measures for the protection of those who campaign for fundamental freedoms. The compromise also contains an entire section devoted to the promotion of democratic principles, electoral processes and parliamentary democracy. Political foundations, as well as national parliaments – an element introduced by our Parliament – are explicitly enumerated among the bodies that are eligible for support. The section dealing with the protection of human rights also satisfies almost all of Parliament's wishes, the only exceptions being the desire for explicit reference to combating impunity and to conflict prevention. On the other hand, the rights of people with disabilities, corporate social responsibility, combating violence against women and many other objectives have been included. Parliament has also secured the establishment of an enhanced structured dialogue that will involve it in the formulation of strategic priorities. We should have wanted it to feature in the body of the text, but the compromise arrangement is that parliamentary involvement is to be ensured through an exchange of letters. As far as explicit reference to democratic political groups is concerned, the Council, as we have just heard, regards that as a no-go area. It therefore proved impossible to include a reference to support for these groups. Nevertheless, an element of flexibility was introduced to allow the funding of other players in duly substantiated cases. In this way, political groups, though not explicitly mentioned, will be able to receive support in certain circumstances. In conclusion, Mr President, let me emphasise the uniqueness of this instrument. It is the only one that funds the projects of non-governmental players without the need for prior authorisation from their government. It is also the only instrument that finances electoral observer missions. This is why it would be neither useful nor responsible to delay its adoption, and hence the funding of these projects, in the vain hope of introducing an explicit reference to political groups. Indeed, an obstinate attachment to that aim has already cost us dear at this stage, since it scuppered the deal struck with the Council on inclusion of the rights of immigrants and asylum-seekers. For these reasons, ladies and gentlemen, I ask you to support the compromise as negotiated with the Council.

 Mr President, I was with Mr Davies, Mrs Morgantini and other Members in Gaza two weeks ago on the day that the Israeli army began the siege of Beit Hanoun. It was the beginning of a campaign of extrajudicial executions, of massacres and of the destruction of civil property. Israel, the occupying power in the Palestinian territories, constantly violates human rights and international humanitarian law with complete impunity. The use of excessive and indiscriminate force against civilians and civil property, the destruction of installations supplying electricity and water, the blowing up of public buildings, the restrictions on freedom of movement and the consequences of all these actions for public health, diet, family life and the psychological state of the Palestinian people constitute a blatant collective punishment which is itself a blatant violation of the Fourth Geneva Convention. Admittedly, there is no excuse for the constant launching of Kassam rockets against Israel, but nothing can justify subjecting a whole people to a draconian punishment like that imposed by Israel. In such circumstances, the European Union must stop giving its backing to Israeli policy. In particular, it must assume its full responsibilities when it comes to supervising the Rafa crossing point and no longer simply bow to the will of the Israeli Government. The EU must use the tools available to it within the framework of the Association Agreement, and in particular the human rights clause, in order to ensure that violations of human rights and humanitarian law do not go unpunished. It must demand the reimbursement of taxes collected illegally by the Israelis. Dialogue with the future government of national unity must be reinstituted as quickly as possible, and direct aid to the Palestinian institutions must be resumed. Finally, the European Union and the Member States must do all they can to have the International Court of Justice’s opinion on the illegal construction of the Wall applied. A meeting of the EU-Israel Association Council must be called as a matter of urgency. Consideration will have to be given to reviewing the Agreement if the violations continue. Finally, the European Union must play its full part in organising an international conference to promote peace in the region.

Madam President, a crucial obstacle on the road to ratification has arisen, namely the ever-worsening human rights situation in Syria. Observers regularly denounce the arbitrary arrests, the acts of torture, the blatant discrimination against minorities, the barriers to freedom of expression and of association, and the harassment and imprisonment of people who work peacefully to enhance freedoms in Syria. I refer in particular to Michel Kilo, Anwar al-Bunni and Mahmoud Issa, who are still being detained for having signed in May the Beirut-Damascus Declaration calling for the normalisation of relations between Lebanon and Syria. Michel Kilo should have been released on 19 October, but a further charge has resulted in his prison term being extended. Mr Issa was released on 25 September but was re-arrested just two days ago. These examples, among many others, demonstrate the lack of a genuine desire on the part of the Syrian authorities to undertake the necessary democratic reforms. Under these circumstances – as you said, Mrs De Keyser – there is no question of the European Union concluding an association agreement with Syria. As the Resolution states, an improvement in the human rights situation and respect for democratic values must be a prerequisite for the conclusion of any agreement. Moreover, it is also important to put in place an effective control mechanism as part of the application of the ‘human rights' clause. This approach should also be applied, inter alia
, to Russia and to Turkmenistan, and to a good many other countries too. The same goes for the consistency of the positions adopted by Parliament.

Madam President, Anna Politkovskaya knows why she is dead. The postscript to her last book is entitled: ‘Am I scared?’ Why did she write? She wrote because she believed that words can save lives. She knew that she was in danger; she had been kept locked up; she had been the victim of a poison attempt; and she regularly received death threats. She was executed simply because she was telling the truth. In her book, ‘Chechnya: Russia’s disgrace’, she writes: ‘Putin and his people have given their blessing to something that no country can accept, namely a form of corruption based on the bloodletting of thousands of victims, an army ravaged by military anarchy, a chauvinistic attitude within the government apparatus that is passed off as patriotism, wild rhetoric about a strong State, and official, popular racism against the Chechens, the fall-out of which extends to other Russian peoples. Putin’s Russia now produces new pogrom enthusiasts on a daily basis, and attacks against the Caucasians have become routine.’ Do you know when she wrote that text? She wrote it in 2003, and what do we see happening today? We see raids, arbitrary arrests and persecutions of the Georgians and of the human rights NGOs, which, I might add, have just lodged a complaint. How does Mr Putin respond? Mr Putin declares that the measures taken against the Georgians are appropriate and that the State agents are acting in accordance with Russian law. Mrs Politkovskaya never stopped denouncing human rights violations. I hope that the 25 will have the courage to say to Mr Putin what that woman alone had the courage to say and that they will not merely utter a few fine words about the investigation … (The President cut off the speaker)

 Mr President, exactly a year ago, more than 11 and perhaps as many as 16 migrants were shot dead in Ceuta and Melilla. Were the bullets Spanish or Moroccan? We do not know, and no inquiry has been conducted. All that we know at present is that one of those killed was from Cameroon. As for the others, no one has any idea who they were. Have we learned the lessons of this tragedy? Not at all, because, in July, three other migrants died – in Melilla, I think – and pressure continues to be exerted on Morocco to sign a readmission agreement even though we have, since then, seen evidence every day that police roundups and deportations into the desert are continuing in this country, as well as violations of the fundamental rights of migrants, including those with papers from the High Commissioner for Refugees. What lessons have we learned from this tragedy? The pressure we continue to put on Morocco has simply caused migrants to take ever more perilous routes further to the south. A few years ago, the idea of reaching the Canaries in small motor boats would have been absolutely unthinkable. Today, it is a reality experienced by many. We know how many of these people arrive in the Canary Islands. We do not know how many left Africa. Thousands, perhaps. Who are they, and what are their names? How many people have perished in this way in Mauritanian or Senegalese waters? What is the policy in question, and what, Mr Frattini, do I hear you say in your interviews? I hear you say that you want a European armada, with patrols, aircraft, boats and military helicopters; that you want, indeed, to protect our borders. That is what I read and what I hear you say, Mr Frattini. Why this bellicose language? Have we gone to war against migrants? European Union policy has entered an absolutely vicious circle. We are buying third countries’ collaboration in supervising their own frontiers, that is to say we are shutting migrants into their own countries.

 Mr President, last week, together with other colleagues from the Subcommittee on Human Rights, I was in Akari province in the extreme south-east of Turkey, just a few mountain peaks away from Iraq and Iran. In that region we met parents, desperate parents powerless to stop their young sons leaving for the mountains. We were told that more than 200 young men have joined the armed bands of the PKK in the last few weeks. We also met young girls fighting against family feudalism, fighting against economic and social isolation and everyday violence. Many spoke of young girls committing suicide. It was not hope, let alone enthusiasm for the future, that we found in Akari and elsewhere. There are many extremely precise facts bearing witness to the violence of the security forces, including against farmers, but also to extra-judicial arrests and the torture of young people as in Diyarbakir this year. The forced resignation of the public prosecutor of Van for demonstrating the responsibility of army members for the Semdinli bombing was also very traumatic. Quite apart from the dirty war exploits it reveals, the frustration of the independence of the judiciary is unacceptable. Everyone says, everyone knows, there is no military answer to the Kurdish question, and yet, with its checkpoints, tanks, soldiers and armed assaults it is the only one that seems effective. The PKK must call a unilateral ceasefire. If that call is heeded and kept, as we hope, it will have to be followed by a wide-ranging political proposal. The attention and support of the European Union will be crucial. The deteriorating situation in the south-east is affecting the human rights situation in the country as a whole. The anti-terrorist legislation was unanimously criticised by the non-government people we spoke to. It does not comply with international law. It may even cancel out some of the progress made in the latest legislative reforms. The situation in the south-east is also rekindling a nationalism that is clearly and sometimes violently opposed to democratic aspirations. The writer Magden Perihan talks about a forest fire. She speaks of hooligan lawyers. Immediate action is required, in particular the abolition of Article 301 of the penal code, bringing anti-terrorist legislation into line with international law, the fight against impunity – in 2005 only 2 out of 305 accused policemen were sentenced – the compensation law must be put into effect – 2 000 cases out of 3 000 have been processed in Akari province – and, lastly, the 10% national voting threshold must be abolished, since it prevents popular democratic expression.

Mr President, (speaking without a microphone) 
EU-Africa Ministerial Conference on Migration and Development, a conference initiated by Morocco, France and Spain, following the tragic events of Ceuta and Melilla. There is one tragedy after another. According to some reports, 3 000 people are thought to have died over the last few months trying to reach the Canary Islands. Yet, the debates are focused not on the duty to protect people, but, once again, on the control, the closing, and even the militarisation, of borders. Yet, as all the reports attest, the majority of population movements are headed for the countries of the South, and not for those of the North, and the number of asylum claims in Europe has halved over the last 15 years. The Union and its Member States have an increasing influence on development aid. Only last week, a Senegalese newspaper ran the headline: ‘Europe is closing our borders’. That strategy puts the lives of twice as many people at risk – those whose only chance of survival is to leave their country, and those who are forced to take ever greater risks in order to enter Europe. Yet, freedom of movement, and more specifically the freedom to leave one’s country, is enshrined in the international standards. The absurdity of this policy is plain to see when we know that the income that migrant workers send back to their countries of origin is twice the amount of official development aid. Rather than guaranteeing respect for the fundamental rights of migrants and asylum seekers, namely the right of access to asylum procedures, the principle of non-refoulement or the right to a private and family life, Europe is multiplying the strategies aimed at shifting this responsibility onto third countries. Worse still, the Member States do not hesitate in violating their own obligations, for example by referring to the readmission agreements and sending people back to countries in which their safety is not guaranteed. The project to create so-called ‘regional protection’ areas in countries such as Belarus is also in keeping with this idea. Finally, the Member States are playing an active part in making the policy of imprisoning migrants and asylum seekers an everyday occurrence, and are going as far as to fund secure detention centres in third countries such as Libya and Mauritania. The European Union must urgently review its policy and listen to the sub-Saharan, North African and European civil societies. A large number of members of these civil societies were gathered together in Rabat last week, and they adopted recommendations that deserve to be taken into account.

Mr President, today’s debate is a repeat of the one that we held exactly six months ago, on 13 December 2005. The Presidency concluded its speech back then in the same manner as today’s speech. I quote: ‘It is now time for us to look forward to the implementation by the Tunisian authorities of the commitments made by President Ben Ali. Implementation of these commitments will be an essential element in developing EU-Tunisia relations'. Since then, steps have indeed been taken by the European Union, but those steps have clearly shown their limits. The deployment of Tunisian police officers and their violent behaviour – which I have witnessed first-hand – prevented the Congress of the Tunisian Human Rights League from being held at the end of May, but not, Mr Busuttil, as a result of a court ruling, given that 32 court actions have been taken against the LTDH. This is well and truly a case of legal harassment. The funds allocated to the associations are still frozen. A great many independent NGOs and political parties are still being denied the right to exist. The judiciary is still being repressed. Mr Abou is still in prison, and the harassment directed towards not only him, but also towards his wife, takes place on a daily basis. You have announced to us, Mr Winkler, that an Association Committee will meet in July. Is that the response to the formal request made by the European Parliament, in December, for an urgent meeting of the Association Committee aimed at looking into the priority issue of human rights in Tunisia? That being the case, it is quite logical that the Tunisian authorities are acting with a growing sense of impunity. I will turn once again to you, Mr Winkler: how might one justify the fact that the Austrian representative did not even think it useful to travel to the Congress, and that he clearly did everything in his power to hamper the action taken by the European Union on the ground? Only two Member States were present at the Congress of the LTDH. Finally, I must emphasise the so-called ‘reform and justice' project. The Tunisian authorities have just succeeded in passing a project establishing a lawyers’ training institute against the unanimous opinion of the Bar Council. The Tunisian authorities still refuse, to this day, to authorise the visit of a United Nations special rapporteur on the independence of judges and lawyers, while the magistrates’ association has simply been disbanded and replaced. How can we believe, under these circumstances, that the Tunisian authorities have the slightest intention of safeguarding the independence of the judicial system? Commissioner, I believe that we must suspend this entire project in order to review it and that we must make the completion of the project and the payment of EU funds subject to certain conditions.

Mr President, the subcommittee decided this year to change the structure of the annual report on human rights. Thus, we will no longer have an assessment of the situation in countries, but a report on the Commission's, the Council's and Parliament's implementation of the EU instruments regarding the promotion of human rights and democracy. We achieved this result despite the difficulties involved. We can congratulate the rapporteur and the political groups. Parliament’s role consists in guiding, monitoring and assessing the policy of the Council and of the Commission. That is why it is crucial that Parliament continues to draft its own report. If we had to draft a report with the input of three different parties for example, we could not criticise a Member State's action – which we can take the liberty of doing with the current report – because all that that Member State would have to do is to veto it. The amendment to Article 8 that we have tabled is along these lines. Mr Howitt’s report presents a number of interesting and innovative proposals concerning the mechanisms for promoting human rights. The report specifically calls for qualified majority voting within the Council and for possible restrictive measures against a third country. It logically follows on from the report adopted by Parliament: the Agnoletto report. The report also proposes to ensure that the United Nations Commission for Human Rights, which has recently been set up, is not chaired by a State that is responsible for human rights violations. Furthermore, it proposes to implement a system aimed at keeping MEPs regularly informed of the actions carried out by the Council and the Commission. The report also stresses the need for cross-cutting human rights policies to be drafted within Parliament. It is in this spirit that the subcommittee proposed to allow the delegations to put forward candidates for the Sakharov Prize. The report refers to the violations of rights, or forms of intolerance, that are practised in certain Member States, to the use of torture, to cruel, inhuman and degrading treatment or to the banishment of people to countries that use torture, to the use of diplomatic assurances and to extraordinary rendition.   That is why we must establish a close link between the European Union's internal and external policies and perhaps contemplate having just one European Parliament report on human rights, drafted together with the Committee on Civil Liberties, Justice and Home Affairs, as the issues related to asylum and immigration require.  As such, I reject paragraph 97, which in some ways supports the implementation of the pilot Regional Protection Programmes. The Commission plans to implement one of these initial programmes in Belarus, a country responsible for numerous human rights violations, which maintains no diplomatic relationship with the Union and which offers no guarantee regarding the protection of migrants. These programmes do not seem appropriate to me.

Mr President, I should like to submit a proposal concerning the human rights situation in Tunisia: this situation remains extremely worrying, as the President of the European Parliament highlighted only last week. Last week, members of the militia violently attacked several lawyers inside the Bar, which continues to be occupied by their fellow lawyers as a sign of protest against the project relating to the creation of a lawyers’ training institute, as provided for in the agreements between the European Commission and Tunisia. In actual fact, the project is designed systematically to bring the training of lawyers under control by placing it at the mercy of the political power and, more specifically, of the Ministry of Justice. We must strongly protest against this attack and show concern about the fate of our fellow lawyers, who are currently rallied in Tunis. The Congress of the Tunisian Human Rights League will take place next week. It is the first Human Rights League on the African continent. It has already been the subject of many European Parliament resolutions. Its Congress will take place in Tunisia, where the conditions and the atmosphere are currently atrocious. It would be helpful if official representatives from Parliament were sent there.

Mr President, I believe that the visits undertaken by the European Parliament’s Committee on Civil Liberties, Justice and Home Affairs have the great merit of highlighting the fact that the imprisonment of foreigners has become, as it were, the standard way of managing migration issues and that this logic of imprisoning foreigners throughout Europe clearly demonstrates the limits of this development and its entirely unacceptable consequences - particularly in Malta - for the reasons that have already been pointed out in the debate. Unfortunately, we need to move on from this de facto observation, since it was already made by large international human rights organisation in 2004 and 2005. We are aware of the situation, and I believe that we must now simply acknowledge the absurdity of the Dublin Agreement being applied to Malta. I believe that we must really forge ahead with this reform and, as some of my fellow Members have requested, do so in an in-depth manner. Firstly, people arriving in Malta must be able to submit and formulate their asylum applications in the countries in which they wish to settle. Equally, people who obtain refugee status in Malta must be able to move freely in Europe, whether, I might add, that be in Malta or in any other country in which they first set foot. I believe that these reforms are entirely necessary if we want to emerge from these situations that are totally catastrophic from the point of view of human rights. Equally, the European Union must be able to establish a lawful policy on migration and stop giving absolute priority to repression and to the closure of borders, with a style of management that we now see to be inhuman and totally lacking in substance. This observation is borne out by the hundreds, indeed thousands, of people who each week drown not only in the Mediterranean Sea, but also in the waters surrounding the Canary Islands, since we know that the flows of migrants have now moved on to Mauritania.

Mr President, I too wish to condemn yesterday’s assault by the Israeli Defence Forces on the Jericho prison. Such actions can only make Hamas's policy more radical and hence make the already very tense relations in that region even more complicated. In view of the violations of international law and human rights and of the democratic challenges in that region, we must deplore the fact that the declarations and commitments resulting from the Barcelona Summit have not been accompanied by a stronger and more concrete commitment to promoting human rights and democracy. Freedom of expression is a universal right, which is both crucial and essential to the development of any democracy. The European Union should not, therefore, spare any effort in defending and promoting it. We are not just talking about the events following the publication of the cartoons. In Algeria, people who attack the President are being tried for slander and being imprisoned or fined. They include Ali Dilem, the correspondent of Sud-Ouest d'Alger
, Bachir El Arabi and Hakim Laâlam, the columnist for Soir d'Algérie.
 Mohammed Benchicou, the director of Le Matin
, has been held in the El-Harrach prison since 14 June 2004. Despite his constantly deteriorating state of health, the authorities refuse to treat him. He has been convicted of or is charged with almost fifty press crimes. He is a prisoner of conscience and not a criminal prisoner, as some people claim. In Tunisia, whose delegation will soon hold the presidency of the EMPA, Mohammed Abbou, the human rights activist and lawyer, has been in prison for more than a year, following the publication of two critical articles. He had already sown up his own mouth in protest against his imprisonment and the conditions in which he is being held. He now plans to stage a hunger strike. In Morocco, Aboubakr Jamai and Fahd Iraki, of the newspaper L'Hebdomadaire
, have been sentenced to pay the equivalent of 143 times the minimum Moroccan annual salary. The 2 February 2006 edition of the Spanish daily El Mundo
 was banned from distribution as a result of an article written by Ali Lmrabet. Journalists from the weekly TelQuel
 have also been convicted of slander. I shall end by calling for more account to be taken of human rights and democracy in the discussions within the EMPA, as we are urged to do by the winners of the Sakharov Prize 2005, Reporters without Borders.

 Mr President, I should like to commend the far-sightedness of Parliament, which arranged this debate hours after the adoption of the resolution, and which will follow suit in adopting such a resolution tomorrow. We can together express our satisfaction and our huge relief in seeing this resolution adopted. Not everything is perfect, of course. For example, the members of the Council will not be elected by a two-thirds majority; certain groups have seen their number of seats increase; and paragraphs have been added. I have no need to go on. That being said, the resolution that has been adopted establishes a permanent Human Rights Council, which boasts some most welcome aspects. For example, members are to be elected by secret ballot by the general assembly; the Council will be able to meet throughout the year, instead of less than three times a year; it will be in a position to react quickly to human rights crises; it retains the UN’s special mechanisms; it guarantees a particular role for NGOs, even though UN reform is needed in this area – something I consider extremely important – aimed at delivering better representation for independent NGOs, including those not recognised; this Council will set up a system for taking stock of the human rights situation in Council Member States. These are all entirely positive aspects. It will also be possible to suspend a country guilty of human rights violations, by a two-thirds majority of the Assembly. These positive points were precisely what Parliament and the EU as a whole were looking for and enjoyed the full support of all of us. I turn finally to the 62nd session of the Human Rights Commission. In all likelihood, it will be a transitional committee, essentially tasked with passing on files to the Council. I call on Member States to remain vigilant, however, and to secure the vote on important issues, such as the adoption of the draft international convention for the protection of all victims of forcible disappearance, the declaration on indigenous peoples and the renewal of mandates such as that of the special representative for human rights defenders.

 Mr President, the clause we are debating today constitutes the basis for and legitimises the European Union's actions towards third countries with regard to respect for human rights. Mr Agnoletto's report puts forward some important proposals that, as you can see, have garnered extremely broad consensus here in Parliament. This clause does suffer from some deficiencies. First of all, there is a lack of uniformity: the wording of the clause may vary from one type of agreement to another. I, and the rapporteur, would advocate a better clause, in order to increase its political and legal impact. It must, for example, be clearly established that the parties to these agreements are required to comply with the international standards and obligations incumbent on them. Secondly, in most cases, as has already been stressed, this clause suffers from a lack of concrete enforcement methods. In order to be consistent, the European Union must establish such methods. We cannot expect to retain our credibility in the eyes of our partners if, on the one hand, we claim to want respect for human rights to be an essential part of our policy but, on the other, we do not take the necessary measures if these countries systematically violate those rights. At the moment, the ACP agreements probably form the most advanced model, which should be our inspiration. The mechanisms for enforcing the clause must also be graduated. We must not see them just as reprimands for human rights violations, but also as ways of helping to strengthen human rights in third countries. That is why the positive approach of the human rights clause is so important. With regard to Parliament's role, in order to guarantee that our policy is consistent, credible and transparent, it is absolutely vital for us to be involved at all the stages of enforcing the clause. When Parliament's resolutions refer to the clause, or call for appropriate measures to be taken, the Council should take heed of these calls and assess whether they are appropriate. The second vital point is the link between the clause and the structures for political dialogue. The link between this clause and the creation of 'human rights' subcommittees must be clear, and these committees should also be strengthened. I also find it regrettable in this connection that the European Union's requirements have been relaxed, particularly for certain of our neighbours. If we want to implement this clause effectively, we must create the forums needed for a frank and constructive exchange of views on human rights. With regard to the reciprocity principle, this dialogue must also be reciprocal, particularly at a time when some of our Member States are having fingers pointed at them because of their anti-terrorism policy, for example, or because of inhumane prison conditions. We must be able to listen to any criticisms our partners may make. Finally, it is important that human rights must not be a matter just for our ministers of foreign affairs, but for all government bodies. That is why I, like the rapporteur, am advocating that the clause be an 'essential element' in all agreements and, finally, that Parliament should no longer give its assent to new agreements that do not contain a human rights and democracy clause.

Mr President, as many Members have pointed out, the European Commission’s initial proposal is socially dangerous, badly drafted and legally complicated. In short, it is exactly the opposite of a sound piece of legislation, that is to say of one that is beneficial to the European project and to Europeans. We, in this Chamber, represent the citizens. There were many tens of thousands of them this afternoon in the streets of Strasbourg. I believe that the demonstration was a healthy exercise in democracy in which the shadow rapporteurs and the rapporteurs took part with the aim of rejecting the directive as it stands and of proposing some substantial changes to its content. The Group of the Greens/European Free Alliance obviously wants a European market in services, but is categorically opposed to its being governed by competition between national laws, which is what the country of origin principle implies and which, in fact, would result in downwards harmonisation. That is why we will vote in favour of the proposal. We have, moreover, tabled some amendments that break with the country of origin principle and that exclude services of general economic interest from the scope of the directive.

Mr President, the tragic events of 30 December in Cairo led to the deaths of 27 people, according to the Egyptian authorities, but in reality there were many more: dozens, even hundreds, up to 220 dead according to some sources. These events must be condemned as vigorously as possible, and the people responsible must be clearly identified. First of all, the responsibility of the Egyptian security forces, whose violence on this occasion must be condemned as vigorously as possible, must be acknowledged. They unfortunately have a reputation for resorting to systematic and excessive violence. The HCR must also bear some of the responsibility. Firstly, because it allowed the situation to become inflamed. Then, because it used ambiguous, even contradictory, language on the subject of the status of the Sudanese people. One only has to read the correspondence between the office of the HCR in Cairo and the Egyptian authorities to see this. Finally, because it directly called upon the Egyptian authorities to intervene, thereby running the risk of things getting out of hand. Nor must we lose sight of the deadlock in which these players found themselves. Following the signature of a peace agreement on 26 May 2004 in Sudan, all of the resettlement programmes were halted, even though we know that the situation in Sudan is still very unstable, as many reports indicate, including the recent report by Human Rights Watch. The States refusing to receive these people solely because a peace agreement has been signed should also therefore bear some of the responsibility. It is not proper to ask Egypt, which already accommodates between two and three million Sudanese, of whom 27 000 are registered with the HCR, to receive all of the refugees from that country. For all of these reasons, as other Members have said, I believe that it is important that an investigation be carried out. It is also important, however, for the Egyptian authorities to release all of the people still being detained, to cease all expulsions and to allow the representatives of the HCR free access so that they can look into the refugees’ demands. It is also important for this tragedy to be seen within the context of the general asylum and immigration policy. We cannot refuse asylum to people who are in danger in their country, and this is not just an issue for Egypt and Sudan, just as Ceuta and Melilla was not a Hispano-Moroccan issue. The Euro-African conference on migration must be held as soon as possible.

 Mr President, Commissioner, if we want the neighbourhood policy to be a real success, we must have full cooperation from our neighbours. From this point of view, I would like to draw your attention, a few weeks after the Barcelona summit, to the fact that most of the Mediterranean heads of state or government boycotted that summit, even those who are our partners under the neighbourhood policy. I feel it is important for the Commission and the Council to draw their own conclusions from the attitude of the partner countries and to take care not to produce the same results in the context of the neighbourhood policy. This boycott was in part a demonstration of the disapproval of the partner countries of, firstly, the considerable pressure placed on them by the Commission and the Member States to conclude cooperation agreements on migration policies and on the fight against terrorism and, secondly, the lack of budgetary prospects for the implementation of a true cooperation and development policy. Can we be sure that the European Union has learnt all its lessons from that? All of the action plans that have so far been negotiated as part of the neighbourhood policy include sections on cooperation in securing the European Union's borders: the fight against terrorism and against illegal immigration. It is unacceptable for the European Union to pursue this policy aiming to make our neighbours take on the role of policing our borders. It is unacceptable because the partner countries do not support it and because the European Parliament has already been very clear in its condemnation of this trend. But were we consulted at any stage of the negotiation of these national action plans? In order to be successful, the European Union's policy must be reciprocal, in other words it must respond to the interests of both sides. It is also important for the European Union's policy to be consistent. We cannot, for example, ask our neighbours to conclude readmission agreements, while certain Member States do not respect the provisions of the Geneva Convention. Nor can we, on the one hand, encourage them to respect human rights and democratic principles and, on the other, close our eyes to flagrant breaches of those rights and principles committed in the name of the fight against terrorism. With regard to human rights, the Commission is negotiating the setting up of 'human rights and democracy' subcommittees. These are important forums for evaluating our effectiveness in this regard. I therefore find it regrettable that the European Union is not making of an more effort to set up such subcommittees with certain states, such as Israel, for example.

Mr President, four years ago, the United States was transferring its first prisoners of the war against terrorism, hooded and chained, to the detention centre at Guantanamo Bay on its naval base in Cuba. Around 500 people, from 35 countries, are still being held, without charge or sentence, deprived of the rights recognised by international law. There are an increasing number of reports of torture and of poor treatment of the detainees in this centre. In fact, the prisoners remain in a ‘lawless’ situation. They are often put in isolation, sometimes for months on end, for having infringed the camp’s strict operational rules. Several have attempted suicide. The United States’ plan to have the detainees tried by military commissions will only heighten the injustice because these commissions are not independent and because they admit statements obtained through the use of force or torture. In these conditions, is it not about time we lent our support to those in Europe who are calling for the closure of this centre?

Madam President, I, like my fellow Members, am delighted that we should be holding this debate today on the annual report on human rights. I am especially delighted by a new chapter focused on analysing the effectiveness of the European Union’s instruments and initiatives. This is precisely the angle chosen by the European Parliament to draft, in full cooperation with the political groups, its report for this year. This outcome demonstrates that, in over the next few years, we – the Commission, the Council and the European Parliament – will, in the long run, finally be in a position to draft a genuine joint report together. To reach this stage, it is important that a continual flow of information circulate between our institutions. I should like to emphasise, for example, the Council conclusions of 12 December, which informed us that the Council – we had no doubts about this – had, on behalf of human rights defenders, launched active lobbying campaigns under the leadership of the Heads of Mission in third countries. Well, it is very useful for MEPs to know to whom, when and how the Council and the ambassadors in third countries provide their support under the guidelines for the protection of human rights defenders. Another example: the Council compiles fact sheets evaluating the human rights situations in the various countries. Here too, the Council should pass on these fact sheets to Parliament so that the various delegations and committees might refer to them in the context of their everyday work. Another example: I read in this report that, for the first time ever, Chinese representatives had participated in the structured dialogue on human rights between the Union and China. In these conditions, I do not understand why Members themselves were not involved in this dialogue, and Members are, moreover, requesting that all representatives be involved in all of the dialogues, irrespective of the structure of these dialogues. As regards the Commission, finally, we are aware of the shortcomings of the European initiative for democracy and human rights, but I must say to you, Commissioner, that I have the gravest reservations and concerns in the face of the document currently being examined by the European Commission on the implementation of the horizontal programme for human rights. This document in no way meets the European Parliament’s expectations, any more than it meets those of the NGOs, as you will see … (The President cut off the speaker)

Mr President, I am pleased that we are holding this debate today. It comes in the wake of the numerous violations of human rights that accompanied the World Summit on the Information Society which, as we know, took place in Tunis. Let me recall them briefly: human-rights activists and journalists were harassed, action was taken to prevent the convening of a citizens’ summit, telephone connections were cut off, e-mails and Internet access were blocked, the speech delivered by the President of Switzerland was censored, other international figures were deported, among them our Sakharov Prize winner Robert Ménard, and so on. Let us remember that these violations are not isolated, one-off occurrences but routine everyday practice in Tunisia. The human-rights situation in Tunisia is deteriorating – as we noted, by the way, in our resolution of 29 September. These latest incidents, I believe, are a direct challenge to the policy of the European Union on democracy and human rights in that country, which was the first signatory of an association agreement containing the famous Article 2, and we must rise to that challenge. The Council has certainly made representations on several occasions, but it is truly regrettable that no public move has been made to denounce the violations of human rights that have taken place and to lend essential support to the incredible mobilisation of civil society, parts of which, incidentally, are represented today in the European Parliament. We consider it important that the Commission and the Council undertake, firstly, to convene a meeting of the Association Council as soon as possible in order to discuss the human-rights situation and the practical consequences of the observed violations and, secondly, to initiate discussions, in the true spirit of the action plan, on a timetable of reforms in the areas already referred to, a precise timetable with deadlines for measurable results: result number one is the reform of the judicial system; in this context, we must demand the release of the lawyer Mohammed Abou and of all political prisoners in Tunisia as well as an end to the harassment of the Tunisian Magistrates’ Association; result number two is the removal of restrictions on the activities of civil society; number three is cooperation with UN mechanisms. These are the minimum requirements if we are to meet the challenge confronting us.

Mr President, I wrote to you at the end of last week to inform you of the recent events with regard to human rights violations in Tunisia, but my letter is already out of date: one undoubtedly has to be prepared for anything and everything to happen in that country. On the eve of the opening of the World Summit on the Information Society, political activists who supported key social and political figures campaigning for the fundamental right of expression and currently on hunger strike, have been violently beaten. Among them was Mokhtar Trifi, the chairman of the Tunisian Human Rights League, with whom you are acquainted and who attended our most recent part-session. Last Saturday, a journalist working for the Libération
 newspaper was stabbed after he had published details of the violations of rights in Tunisia. This is therefore a tragic situation, and I believe that, even if our ad hoc delegation is completely up to speed with the situation and is preparing to support both the alternative summit and civil society in Tunisia, we perhaps also ought to make the Council sit up and take note of the situation in Tunisia, by specifically calling for the Council urgently to gather together an Association Council enabling us to assess the agreement that links us to this country which, without a shadow of a doubt, is more and more disappointing each day.

Mr President, I believe that we have done well to instigate this debate, because what Mr Frattini has told us is slightly different from what was initially announced and because you will at least recognise that, if such mysteriously named places – black sites, salt mines containing ‘ghost prisoners’, etc. – do actually exist, then Article 6 of the Treaty and the Treaty itself would be given short shrift. The debate is a first step. I believe that you will be called on to take further steps as regards this issue. Why? Because this is an extremely important issue. It is a question of people who have allegedly been detained, without first having been tried, for an unspecified length of time and without any appeal whatsoever, and who are therefore in all likelihood subjected to torture and inhumane and degrading treatment. We therefore have potential violations here of Articles 3, 5 and 6 of the European Convention on Human Rights, as well as potential violations of the European Convention for the Prevention of Torture and the International Pact on Civil and Political Rights. The latest news is that two countries, one belonging to the European Union and the other in the process of joining the EU, are cited as having housed such centres. I say ‘having’ housed, since these countries are today denying these acts of which they are accused and because the reports in question date back to 2002 and 2003. What they are denying is taking place today could therefore be compatible with the facts presented in the reports, and particularly in the report by the Human Rights Watch, but the fact of recognising that the potential existence of such centres can constitute a violation of the Treaty on the European Union and Article 6 thereof calls for you to do more than just issue statements, Commissioner. You say that you are leaving the matter in the hands of the Member States. You say that you are going to examine closely the investigation expedited by the Council of Europe; I will tell you, by the way, that the European Parliament’s Subcommittee on Human Rights has already decided to invite Mr Marty as soon as his work has been handed over. You say that you are waiting to see what the United States itself decides on this issue and you have expressed your desire for investigations to be carried out at a technical level. I, for my part, believe that all that is far from adequate. Quite simply, Commissioner, you must expedite an investigation in order to shed light on this situation, which is detrimental to the foundations of the European Union and to its credibility on the international stage.

 Madam President, I think that Mrs Wallström and yourself, Commissioner, have, like others, put your finger on an issue on which the Barcelona process has not kept all its promises. I am referring, of course, to the issue of human rights and democracy. If you are not convinced, you simply have to take stock of the situation regarding freedom of the press in the region – this was done at the invitation of Mrs Patrie this afternoon – or the situation regarding freedom of expression in Tunisia, on the eve of the World Summit on the Information Society. The proof can be seen in the number of violations of the rights to freedom of association, freedom of expression and freedom of assembly; a justice system that suffers major deficiencies in many countries; the torture which is commonplace, or even virtually systematic, in some countries, and the defenders of human rights who, all over the world, are the victims of numerous violations of their rights and are subject to a great deal of harassment. The Barcelona process has therefore not kept all its promises on these issues. As Mrs Jäätteenmäki said, I believe that it has some shortcomings with regard to women’s rights, economic and social rights and the mechanisms put in place for an effective policy regarding democracy and human rights. Despite all that, the Barcelona process has made it possible to institute mechanisms and forums for political dialogue on these issues, and has therefore laid the necessary foundations to launch an ambitious policy of promoting human rights and democracy. You said, Commissioner, that the issue of immigration would be at the heart of the discussions at the Barcelona Summit. Allow me, in this regard, to draw your attention to one point. I think that, with regard to the fight against terrorism and illegal immigration, we are encouraging countries to break international law. That is pretty clear and it has just been illustrated once again by the incidents at Lampedusa involving Libya, and more recently by the incidents in the Spanish enclaves of Ceuta and Mellila and in Morocco. By asking these countries to stem the flow of sub-Saharan refugees, we are encouraging and urging them to commit human rights violations. Before we try to quell the flood of those we call ‘illegal immigrants’, Europe itself has to define its legal immigration policy. However, you will be aware that we are making hardly any progress on this issue. I am convinced that civil society and Members of Parliament can help to improve the implementation of our policies on human rights and democracy in this region. That is why I very much hope that the Commission will be present in Rabat for the next extraordinary meeting of the Euro-Mediterranean Parliamentary Assembly.

 Mr President, I am not going to philosophise on the notion of a package but I can tell you that my group intends to vote enthusiastically for the Sterckx report and the Savary report and is delighted to be able to do so tomorrow. With regard to Mr Jarzembowski’s proposal, on the other hand, the discussions have been more closely argued and doubtful, because we are not in favour of the status quo. To make matters clear: we really want to strengthen European rail transport because we want to encourage means of transport that are safer and more economical in terms of energy and space and therefore more sustainable. That seems to me perfectly clear. The question we are asking ourselves is this: will this objective be achieved through the liberalisation of international rail passenger transport under the conditions outlined in this report? That is where questions start to arise. Will we actually achieve a transfer from road and air to rail? Will we guarantee a safer and more accessible service for people and better social and territorial cohesion? To find out, surely we could conduct a serious evaluation. We have experience, within the Member States, of passenger transport being opened up to competition; we have the first and second packages. Let us take a closer look at what happens in terms of quality, of real transfer from road to rail, of prices and of safety. In short, there are many questions. We wonder about the compatibility between the opening up to competition of national corridors through cabotage and respect for the obligations of public service as set out in the July regulation. We ask ourselves, as indeed do other Members, whether we are not going to move, in some countries, from a monopoly situation to an oligopoly situation or whether we are not going to see the emergence, as in air transport, of low cost companies, to the detriment of working conditions and safety. In short, for the majority of my group it is inconceivable for us to support Mr Jarzembowski’s proposals.

 Mr President, we are seeing a growing and very worrying number of situations worldwide in which states are using the argument of the fight against terrorism as the basis for a policy of repression of other non-terrorist groups, or to violate the most fundamental rights of people assumed to be terrorists. There are plenty of examples, in Pakistan, China, Morocco, Saudi Arabia, Tunisia, Yemen, Kenya and many other countries besides, and often the defenders of human rights, as the United Nations’ Special Representative, Mrs Jilani, pointed out, are among the first victims of the fight against terrorism. In Tunisia, for example, the government adopted an anti-terrorism law in 2003, a law that claims to support international efforts in the fight against terrorism, but that in fact attacks the basic rights of citizens, peaceful activities of civil society, trade unions and political parties. With regard to the United States, we are aware of the violations committed in Guantanamo Bay and Abu Ghraib, where hundreds of non-American nationals are detained indefinitely, without being subject to legal proceedings and with no likelihood of a trial. Nor can we ignore the very serious accusations made, particularly against the United States, by international NGOs such as Amnesty International, according to which a number of individuals arrested as part of the war on terrorism are being detained in unknown locations. These accusations are backed up by official reports discussing the situation of ghost prisoners, held secretly in prisons and transferred from one place to another to hide them from the attention of the International Committee of the Red Cross. No less serious are the accusations made by NGOs such as Human Rights Watch against countries within the European Union –
 the Netherlands, the United Kingdom, Germany, Austria and Sweden –
 who do not hesitate to return alleged terrorists to countries such as Syria, Egypt or Uzbekistan, where the risk that they will be tortured or mistreated is very high. Such practices are contrary to international rules on respect for human rights, particularly the non-refoulement principle. The Member States of the EU, as we have seen, are not to be outdone. We cannot fail to be concerned, too, by a draft Commission recommendation to the Member States relating, Mr Frattini, to not-for-profit organisations, which states in its introduction that there is evidence that not-for-profit organisations have been used to fund terrorism and other criminal activities. A generalisation of that kind, such a lack of nuance in a Commission document, is particularly unforgivable and concerning.

Mr President, allow me first of all, because we are resuming this debate in very distressing conditions, to offer my sincere condolences to the families of the victims of the attacks that have taken place in London, the terrible consequences of which we are learning minute by minute. To return to our debate, the major importance of which was stated this morning, my group, through Caroline Lucas’s speech, has stressed the extent to which it supports the series of temporary measures that are being proposed. That said, I should like today to highlight certain points that appear to me to be essential. The first concerns two paragraphs in the report that seek to minimise the scope of the REACH Directive, and which we consider to be totally unacceptable. Those two paragraphs actually make a very clear recommendation to limit the scope of application of the directive in order to prevent its having – supposedly – harmful consequences for the textile industry and its competitiveness. I would remind you that the draft REACH Directive, currently being debated in Parliament, proposes to record, assess and monitor the use of chemical substances that could be harmful to our health and our environment. These references are therefore completely unacceptable, because we do not believe that the competitiveness of our industry can be increased at the expense of health, the environment and employees’ working conditions. It is all the more unacceptable given that in my region, for instance, the Nord-Pas-de-Calais, which is hard hit by the restructuring, we are unfortunately well versed in this type of debate, which advocates curbing environmental demands in order, so they say, to protect jobs. That systematically results in a social and environmental disaster. I am referring, of course, to the very high number of asbestos victims. I am also thinking of the Metaleurop affair, which was the subject of a major debate in this House, and which caused the inhabitants of the region to lose their jobs, their health and their soil, unusable for years. This attack against the REACH Directive is therefore entirely misplaced, all the more so since it is expected that its effect on the textile and chemical industry in general will be to foster and drive the capacity for innovation. Our discussion ought to be much more focused on the competitive advantage resulting from the low cost of producing textiles products in China. In fact we should be aware that these low production costs are due to the exploitation of Chinese workers and to the violent suppression of their demands. Allow me to refer to an extract from an Amnesty International report, a relatively recent one since it dates from 2002, which states very clearly that in private companies in China overtime is not only compulsory, but is also unpaid, and that certain factories impose fines on those refusing to work overtime or arriving late for work. Chinese workers work between 10 and 12 hours per day and their accommodation and food costs are often deducted directly from their wages. It is not unusual for businesses to withhold wages for sometimes two months, or to keep the identity cards of certain workers for several months. In short, trade unions are hugely repressed. Since we have a structured dialogue with China on human rights – talks moreover took place last week – it seems to me that we ought to highlight the freedom of trade unions. The numerous trade unionists today incarcerated in Chinese prisons ought to be the subject of protection measures, protection measures provided for in the EU Guidelines on Human Rights Defenders. This is an entirely crucial factor in the debate, which, I believe, has been unjustly concealed.

Mr President, I shall devote these few words to an extremely important issue, namely the reform of the United Nations programme for human rights. I am delighted to see – not only here in Parliament but also in the Commission and the Council – that the general outline of a reform of the UN’s instruments assessing human rights is emerging and, moreover, that it corresponds to the work now being undertaken, by which I mean the package proposed by the UN Secretary-General and also the action plan which has just been submitted to Kofi Annan by the High Commissioner, Mrs Louise Arbour. These are extremely interesting approaches which, moreover, are echoed in the excellent report by Mr Laschet. The transformation into a permanent council is obviously a revolution in the UN’s system of human rights. Why? Because it will provide us with a body able to apply permanent pressure on countries violating human rights, and, as we have just said, these violations are a permanent threat to security, development and peace. That is an absolutely vital reform. With regard to the increase in the resources available to the High Commissioner’s office, I believe everyone is in agreement. I think we shall also have to look at the substance of the activity of this Council and at the way it works: in that area, the reference that the European Parliament’s report makes to peer group assessment – namely assessment by other countries – which is a transparent, just and equitable appraisal system for all countries, helping to avoid the charge of double standards, appears an absolutely fundamental one.

 Mr President, as I see it, the challenge we face is to fight terrorism effectively while fully respecting human rights and basic freedoms. As has already been said, we have our hands tied because of the ‘no’ vote here in France, and there is also another major problem or handicap: there is no international definition of terrorism. That means that no possible legal remedy exists, and there is no legal certainty, no guarantee and no protection. I therefore believe that the European Union should strive towards a properly recognised definition, both for itself and at international level. Mr Van Hecke proposed a simple definition: for terrorist, read Muslim. President Putin has another definition: terrorist means Chechen. The Chinese have other definitions. I believe that these incredibly broad, abusive and arbitrary definitions of terrorism mean that we are losing our ability to act effectively in the fight against terrorism. I accordingly believe that we, that is to say the European Union, should make a significant effort, as quickly as possible – at the next UN General Assembly, for example – to secure a definition of terrorism, which is vital and which will also facilitate genuine cooperation between states, at European level and also at world level.

This time, however, we really must express our admiration for the work Mr Coveney has done; he has listened very hard and worked meticulously to produce what really is a full, clear and fair report. We can all see that successfully appraising the human rights situation country by country is not an easy thing to achieve. I would therefore like to add my own sincere congratulations to all those that have been addressed to him. This report contains a tremendous number of positive points and my Group is particularly pleased with the balance it achieves in the matter of respect for human rights in the fight against terrorism. That is a subject which I believe is attracting a lot of attention internationally, at European level and in this House, and what we are seeing today – I mean what has just been decided following the UN session – will, with the rapporteur’s help, enable us to make very significant progress in the matter. My group also welcomes the extension of civil and political rights to economic and social issues with an important chapter on the social responsibility of business. When we consider the amendments tomorrow, I would like us also perhaps to recognise the right to development as an inalienable human right, as the UNDP’s work on the degradation of ecosystems and the effects of pollution on our ability, on a world scale, to achieve the Millennium goals invites us to do and as was stated in a United Nations declaration in 1986. The Johannesburg summit also reiterated the essential nature of respect for environmental and social standards and human rights. I will be inviting you to consider these questions tomorrow. Having said that, I believe the most important thing about this report is probably the ability, an ability we can continue to develop in the years ahead, to analyse the European Union’s instruments for protecting and promoting human rights and democracy in the world. I believe that is an extremely important chapter. Everyone today can see to what extent the European Union’s credibility, people’s expectations of it and what it will become with the hoped-for adoption of the Constitution are focussed around the question of human rights and democracy, and I do not believe we will be able to get a European way of doing things accepted in dialogue, in credibility and in equity if we are incapable of making considerable progress internally, between our institutions. If we really want all our mechanisms to be monitored and evaluated, the European Parliament must be involved, and kept informed about, every action decided in accordance with the guidelines and with the structured human rights dialogues and be involved in all the measures taken by the Commission and the Council. Our policy will be more effective and more coherent if we have better interinstitutional dialogue. (Applause from the left)

Mr President, I must express my surprise at the fact that, in their remarks, neither the Commissioner nor the President-in-Office of the Council elaborated on the external dimension of asylum and immigration policy. You will not be unaware that the European Parliament has decided to discuss the Lampedusa situation and the camps in Libya in the context of its topical and urgent resolutions on Thursday, that the delegation for relations with the Maghreb countries and the Maghreb Arab Union (including Libya), which will be travelling to Libya next week, has decided to visit a reception centre for aliens and that the Committee on Civil Liberties, Justice and Home Affairs is thinking about undertaking a fact-finding mission. In these circumstances, I believe that the interest of the European Parliament, which has on several occasions reiterated its opposition to externalisation of asylum and to the establishment of camps at the external borders of the Union, warranted a fuller statement on your part. The fundamental rights that have been flagrantly violated on Lampedusa and in Libya are enshrined not only in the Charter of Fundamental Rights but also in the European Convention for the Protection of Human Rights and Fundamental Freedoms and the Geneva Convention on the Status of Refugees. In the light of these facts, does the Council intend to make representations to the offending State about the repeated and systematic violation of rights, given that this is the third time, I believe, that the Lampedusa issue has arisen?

 My group will be happy to sign and vote for the resolution drafted this morning, which sets out a number of views that are extremely important for the European Parliament. You have also expounded and supported those views yourselves, Mr President-in-Office of the Council and Commissioner Michel. We welcome and encourage the popular demonstrations now being held in Beirut and those that recently took place in Kiev, and believe there are lessons to be learnt from them. We believe they provide the strongest guarantees for the process of democratisation, as long as the people involved know and feel that they can count on international support. That is a lesson we must remember and from which we must draw conclusions for the future. We, too, like those demonstrators and like the united people of Lebanon, are waiting for clear answers to emerge from the inquiries being held – both the fact-finding mission dispatched by Kofi Annan and the investigations being undertaken by the Lebanese authorities – to identify precisely who was responsible for this appalling act. We have also heard the statements made by the Lebanese and Syrian Presidents, and we look forward to further statements. In fact, given that provision is made for this in the Taif Agreement, why should the security services be excluded from the withdrawal plan? The Syrian security services in Lebanon should also be withdrawn. It has to be said now that pursuing this process of democratisation is the best means we have of ensuring stabilisation, and we have already heard just how crucial that stabilisation is for the region. We expect a great deal from the democratisation process, and the Commission should not, in the report it is preparing on all aspects of the situation in Lebanon and on EU-Lebanon relations, overlook certain key issues that are fundamental for the future of democracy. These include the return of the death penalty; the tens of thousands of people who have disappeared in Lebanon; Lebanon’s adoption of the Rome Statute on which the International Criminal Court is founded; its adoption of the Geneva 
Convention 
Relating to the Status of Refugees; a solution to the issue of Palestinian refugees; and also certain individual cases of great concern to this House, such as that of the lawyer Mr Mughrabi, who is in prison today as a result of statements he actually made in this Chamber to Members of the European Parliament. There are therefore a lot of hopes riding on this situation, hopes that I am sure this resolution will encourage.

 To be quite clear, I want to ask Mr Salafranca Sánchez-Neyra whether he is in fact proposing that we remind the Presidency of his request to continue its efforts in support of the Brazilian initiative concerning discrimination based on orientation and sexual identity by seeking other countries’ support for a resolution on this problem. Is that it? Does he want to repeat the terms? In fact, if we delete the first part, we will have to restate what it is about in the second part.

 The situation we are seeing in Togo today calls for the strongest condemnation from our Parliament of the coup
 d'état
 that brought Fauré Gnassingbé to power in that country. I am therefore very pleased about the Council’s statements and the European Parliament’s response today through this resolution. Just as we showed our solidarity with the protagonists of the ‘orange’ revolution in Ukraine a few weeks ago, we must today give our support to the Togolese demonstrators who are refusing to accept this coup
 d'état
 and are being harshly repressed for doing so. There have already been several deaths in the demonstrations taking place in Lomé. It is all absolutely unbearable and intolerable. Europe must bring all its weight to bear in rejecting this hereditary dictatorship, which is backed by certain Mafia financial networks, calling first of all for the resignation of Fauré Gnassingbé and then for the drawing up of a new constitution. That is the only way to guarantee the holding of free and transparent elections, to ensure the return to democracy of a country that has been bled dry and reduced to poverty by General Eyadéma’s dictatorship and to enable the European Union to resume its cooperation with Togo, which has been suspended since 1993 and which the Togolese people greatly need.

 Mr President, Mr President-in-Office of the Council, Commissioner, my colleagues and I are very pleased that this year, 2005, will see the renewal and relaunching of the Euro-Mediterranean dialogue, because that is how we have always referred to the Barcelona Process, in order to emphasise both all the hope it has raised and all the disappointments which are growing as the days go by. My colleagues have referred to the despicable and abhorrent assassination of Rafiq Hariri, following which a question mark now hangs over that part of the world, just when a glimmer of light was appearing in the Middle East that we want to foster and see grow. We need to go beyond the wishes we have been reiterating for 10 years and think about how we can really achieve some progress on the main issues regarding democracy and human rights in that part of the world, because it is those fundamental issues that underpin the fight against terrorism, the issues of peace and stability and development. As the Arab Bureau never tires of saying in its different United Nations development reports, it is on this fundamental issue of democratic foundations, of individual and collective freedoms in that part of the world that we need to work. We have several ways forward. The Commission also has several ways forward, which it has set out in a communication in the form of 10 extremely precise recommendations. I believe that appropriate tools, the national action plans, the creation of the human rights subcommittees as part of this process, that is to say the new neighbourhood policy, are really needed to help us to implement those 10 recommendations, which as you said, Commissioner, go beyond the purely intergovernmental approach in that part of the world. That is what the strength, the potential power of this Euro-Mediterranean Parliamentary Assembly and also of the Euromed civil society platform is all about, because we are all aware that our ambitious aims of democracy and development in that region can only come about with the deep commitment of those societies themselves. We will shortly be welcoming Mr Yushchenko. We know that all our policies and all our aspirations depend first and foremost on the energy of the societies themselves to free themselves from complex situations that destroy freedom. I believe that is what we must … (The President cut off the speaker

 Mr President, Mr President-in-Office of the Council, Commissioner, you rightly referred to the many initiatives taken by the European Union at the sixtieth session of the United Nations Commission on Human Rights. I agree, but I also remember what Shirin Ebadi said following that sixtieth session. Speaking of the silence on Iran and on the human rights situation in Iran, she said: ‘silence is an insult to the victims’. Those words have stayed with me and I believe we must also remember that at that sixtieth session a number of countries, among them China, Zimbabwe and Cuba, took extremely strong initiatives with a view to stripping the Commission on Human Rights of its substance. The European Union must be particularly vigilant in the face of such extremely damaging strategies on the part of some countries. I hear what you say, Mr President-in-Office of the Council, about us having several instruments available – I am thinking of China. But why should they be mutually exclusive? For countries such as these, the European Union’s credibility, its effectiveness, lies in showing that it does not have double standards: yes, it has several instruments, but they are not mutually exclusive. I believe Parliament’s resolution will help to make the European Union’s activity more cohesive and coherent; at any rate, that is what everyone who has spoken in this House wants. We have emphasised a number of rights that are considered new rights, third generation rights. It would be much to the European Union’s credit and advantage to emphasise those rights, which are connected with globalisation. I am thinking of human rights, the rights of man and the responsibility of transnational corporations. The UN is working on these questions; the European Union could encourage and support it. We have also spent a long time debating the right words for the fight against terrorism, which remains a cause for anxiety in many respects, as Mr Ribeiro pointed out. We would like the States to be given recommendations by the UN on counter-terrorism, because we find there are serious failings in this area. I will end very quickly on the question of journalists in war zones. We are talking about a dramatic situation that everyone finds moving. I do not believe the international machinery for protecting such journalists is coherent and effective enough and we ought to give this question some thought, too.

 Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, perhaps we should start with the very timely question posed quite rightly by Mr Fava regarding the dialogue between our institutions. It is a recurring theme, which by the way makes this late sitting at this late season of the year worthwhile. On this subject, Commissioner, we have heard you say and we have read – and you also said in your hearing – that you wanted to maintain a dialogue that people can describe as they see fit, but which I in any case understood to be regular, relevant, open and prolonged, or, in short, structured. This proposal, the offer of dialogue, is clearly one that Parliament will jump at, because, as you know, the Members of this House are eager to have the opportunity to engage in in-depth discussions about the direction and ongoing monitoring of this initiative and to receive information about programming. Ladies and gentlemen, the ball is in our court and I am sure that the Commission would be delighted to see a proposal emanate from our ranks, from our committees and groups, in short from our Parliament, so that this dialogue can get underway very quickly, because it is urgently needed, with a group of Members who are well-motivated and have some expertise on this issue, and there is no shortage of such people in this institution. Let us return to the initiative. I think that we need to reiterate the extent to which it brings added value to all of the actions that the European Union might undertake on democracy and human rights. It has perhaps not been said often enough that it is the only means at our disposal to support, against the will of governments that are often autocratic or dictatorial, civil society, activists and NGOs working in conditions that are often extremely complicated. It is the only instrument that enables us to act in this way, and it is extremely precious. In addition, I would add that the aid that is given to NGOs in this way is perceived on the ground as being neutral, that is to say that the European Union is not providing these grants in a bid to dominate or take over and is not perceived as doing so, contrary to the claims made when American agencies work on the ground, with such claims very often heard in Maghreb, in any case. It is a very precious asset, made possible by the quality of the European Union’s intervention. Of course there is still room for improvement. One of the issues, and we all know of many examples, is that some NGOs cannot, for one reason or another, be supported under this initiative. The governments of third countries which do not wish to see democratic movements develop in their midst are not lacking in resources or imagination. We have cases of legal NGOs being granted support under the initiative and then being quite simply banned from receiving the grant by a political decree or by direct censure. All of the decisions have been taken, but these NGOs are prevented from benefiting from the funds granted to them. We have other examples of associations which quite simply do not legally exist. In such cases we have to resort to subterfuge, and we therefore need the ability to be flexible and find ingenious solutions on the ground to achieve our goals. I should like to conclude by saying that this debate would serve no purpose if we were not already thinking beyond 2007. And there, as other Members have rightly done, I would draw attention to the fact that we will need to work within this Parliament to ensure that this precious asset, that we can always improve, is able to endure beyond 2006. That is what is at stake in the debates that we are going to have to hold at various different levels within this Parliament.

 Mr President, I visited Tunisia on 10 December on the invitation of two associations, the Tunisian Human Rights League and the National Council for Liberties in Tunisia, to join in their celebrations of the anniversary of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights. I regret to inform you that Mr Ben Ali’s security staff prevented the National Council for Liberties in Tunisia from holding its annual general meeting, in the process not hesitating to hit, beat up, and throw to the ground several militants from this association. In the light of this, I believe that it is important to convey to the Council and the Commission that it is absolutely essential to implement the guidelines for the protection of defenders of human rights, because quite obviously Mr Ben Ali continues to hold all of those who represent civil society in Tunisia in total contempt.

 Mr President, it is my belief that since the beginning of this debate the facts about democracy and the human rights situation have risked being twisted to suit the final objective sought, that is either the accession or non-accession of Turkey. One of the merits of Mr Eurlings’s report is precisely that it avoids doing this. The report contains a huge amount of very interesting and very precise information about the human rights situation and Mr Eurlings really cannot be accused of toning down certain points in order to strengthen the case for accession. This is a great achievement because the challenge was a considerable one. It seems to me that some Members nevertheless find themselves in an extremely paradoxical situation, because no one can deny that the prospect of Turkey’s accession is a powerful lever to encourage democratisation. Perhaps we have not made sufficient mention in our speeches of the packages of legislative reforms that have been adopted. It is right to say that things are not moving quickly enough on the ground. But to refuse accession today because the Copenhagen political criteria have not been met would be tantamount to interrupting a process of democratisation supposedly on the grounds of democratic values, which is completely illogical and paradoxical. I wish therefore to draw attention to the fact that this position is to some extent a hypocritical one. There is also an intermediate strategy which is to accumulate a large number of restrictions and go for accession while simultaneously backing away from it. Conditions are imposed and laid down and alternatives are sought. I think that Mr Brok is right, but I do not draw the same conclusions as he does: to set out a half-hearted accession strategy is to prepare for failure. What we need is an open, full and complete accession, which is also absolutely rigorous. If we work towards these two objectives we will, I believe, make a success of the multicultural Europe that we want to see created with Turkey’s accession.

 Mr President, I also feel like rejoicing over what has been happening for the last ten days in Kiev and almost throughout Ukraine, over this massive, extremely determined and entirely peaceful demonstration in favour of strict transparency as regards the ballot box and the ballot papers, which have been falsified and manipulated by those currently in power. I feel that the dynamic at work in Ukraine itself should be brought to the fore. Entire sections of Ukrainian society are collapsing, with journalists, intellectuals, civil society, the authorities and the institutions all claiming their right to free speech. Against this backdrop, I feel it is useful to highlight the fact that the mobilisation of civil society has enriched and probably increased the effectiveness and coherence of EU action to address this situation. It is also true that we are starting to dream that the EU can take a similarly coherent and effective stance in other EU-neighbouring countries where the will of civil society is stifled by authoritarian and autocratic leaders. This is, for that matter, what the EU is doing with the countries in question, on the basis of common values and commitments. This should be emphasised, as should the extent to which this approach differs from that of Russia and differs from what is already happening in that country, where calumny prevails in all of the State-monopolised media. We are indeed entitled to feel much more concerned about democracy today in Russia than about the future of democracy in Ukraine.

 Mr President, I should like to return to the issue of the Hague Programme and to ask the Council a number of questions relating to this Programme, which undoubtedly represents a major innovation in its introduction of a move to qualified majority voting for Title IV. Some Members have expressed reservations with regard to legal immigration, but I should like to ask more detailed questions on the external dimension of asylum and immigration policies, something that is acquiring an ever greater significance. It is apparent that these policies are becoming increasingly dependent on the EU’s ability to conclude Partnership and Cooperation Agreements on returns, readmissions, the strengthening of capacities, border control and police and judicial cooperation, or in other words on a set of agreements with third countries which are not subject to codecision. We are doubly concerned because we have absolutely no trust in people such as Mr Schily or Mr Pisanu, who have put forward various proposals such as those on the establishment of camps, immigration gateways or checkpoints outside the EU. Despite the fact that these high-flown ideas have mainly been rejected, that they do not form part of the Hague Programme and that they have aroused the fierce opposition of hundreds of NGOs and of a great many members both of national parliaments and of this House, we remain concerned, because the Hague Programme includes a reference to a feasibility study on the processing of asylum applications outside the EU and because we are also aware that EUR 1 million has been released to enable the High Commissioner for Refugees to strengthen its capacities for dealing with asylum seekers in North African countries. The question we are therefore asking ourselves is whether this does not represent both a violation of this House’s democratic powers and a relinquishing of the duties incumbent upon this House and the EU in the field of asylum and immigration, with these duties being handed over to third countries whose capacities are a great deal less developed than our own.

 Personally, I am delighted with the words I have heard from Members of this House and I note that Parliament has certainly adopted a wise attitude. I should like to say to Mr von Wogau – whom I congratulate on his position on the lifting of the embargo, in other words, his desire not to lift it – that at the same time the restrictive nature of the Code cannot be left in the hands of the Member States. It is clear that certain Heads of Government have few scruples when it comes to China. Have we not heard Mr Chirac say that the embargo belonged to a different era? In this context, I should call on these Heads of State, whose eyes have clearly been opened wide by the enormous market that China represents, to go and take a closer look at what is happening in stadiums, at what is happening in Iveco trucks and at what is happening in a number of places where summary executions are carried out. I feel that China is the current world champion of human rights violations and, failing that, the world champion of capital punishment, which goes on unchecked and in entirely unacceptable extrajudicial conditions. I should like to ask if violating the Code, which, as everyone has said, the lifting of the arms embargo on China would represent, should not also be condemned if expressed verbally, as some Heads of State have done. I welcome the fact that the Council is seeking to reform the Code and urge strenuous efforts to prevent such statements, which clearly harm the credibility of many policies pursued by the EU in the field of respect for human rights.

 Mr President, I should like to remind you that, this weekend, presidential and legislative elections took place in Tunisia. When election results go as expected, they do not make big news. Nevertheless, like other Members of this House, I believe I have some information of a constitutional nature. We remember the constitutional coup that enabled President Ben Ali to stand for a fourth time, yet we also know that the Constitution contains a number of severe constraints that prevent and restrain his capacity to stand. We also have consistent information on the conditions under which these elections were held, not least from the point of view of media access, which was characterised by a total absence of pluralism. One candidate, the only one in the presidential elections to have enjoyed a modicum of independence – a great deal of independence if one compares him with Mr Ben Ali – was not allowed to publish and distribute his official election manifesto. We also know that the Tunisian Human Rights League, a body that Parliament trusts and is happy to deal with, was prevented from properly monitoring these elections.

 Mr President, I should like to draw your attention to the risks that our shameful, indeed culpable, silence is bringing to bear upon what is happening at this very moment on the island of Lampedusa, events that clearly have the blessing of the Council, the Commission and all the authorised bodies, despite the fact that the practices concerned – collective expulsions with no opportunity of appeal – are very obviously taking place contrary to, and in total and utter violation of, extremely important commitments. That being the case, I cannot believe, listening to you, Commissioners and members of the Council, that we are heading towards reinforcing our common asylum policy and promoting fundamental rights, when we allow to take place, under our very eyes and without any reaction on our part, what is nothing but a wholly illegal act of force, seriously damaging our desire and our efforts – laborious as they of course are – to progress towards a common asylum and immigration policy. Which country, moreover, does the EU nation concerned choose as a place to which to send those who have been expelled? It turns to a country that is notorious for attacking human freedoms, for acting outside any legal framework in arresting and persecuting people, for giving immigrants the worst possible welcome and for carrying out acts of torture. This country is, moreover, regularly targeted and cited in international reports. There are therefore many ways in which it breaches several European and international undertakings. I do not genuinely think that our desire to progress towards a common asylum and immigration policy could survive our silence – and, in my view, a culpable silence – regarding what is happening. Any Member State could see such silence as an opportunity to put in place bilateral agreements that would totally undo our laborious efforts to devise a common policy. I would therefore ask you, Presidents of the Commission and of the Council, to express your total disapproval of this type of agreement.

 Mr President, I would like to ask the President-in-Office of the Council, Mr Bot, what has happened to him in the space of a week. A week ago, Mr Bot, you asked the Russian authorities a very simple question as to how it had been possible for this tragedy to occur. A very simple question, and one that you were right to ask, but you are wrong today in your desire to see it buried. Why is this so? After all, it is the question being asked by all the families in Beslan; it is the question being asked by all those families as they grieve. What happened? What has come to pass? How can you not see that, in this tragedy, the Russian powers-that-be have deployed all the calculating cynicism of which they are capable – manipulation, disinformation, poisonings – and the best journalists, experts on Chechen issues, found themselves being prevented from reaching the scene. How are these facts to be denied? How can one not put these questions to the Russian authorities? How, Mr President-in-Office of the Council, can you cooperate in the fight against international terrorism with a power that first denied that there was any connection with the conflict in Chechnya, with a power that then condemned the independent and moderate President Maskhadov, putting a price on his head? Now this same power has proclaimed an international war on the global scourge of terrorism, finally asking all states to refrain from interfering in its internal affairs. Who is that power, inconsistent and manipulative, with which you seek to cooperate in saving democracy, the rule of law, and our code of values? Think about it, Mr Bot.

Mr President, first of all I would like to apologise for my absence during this crucial vote. As the train from Paris to Strasbourg was one and a quarter hours late several of my colleagues and I were unable to vote on this Directive and resolution. Like my group I would have voted completely against the resolution and the directive. I wish here and now to express my deepest disgust. The dignity of this Parliament and of the wider European Union is not in keeping with the detention centres in which we house tens, hundreds or even thousands of our fellow citizens who are immigrants or are from an immigrant background. All this seems to smack of self-protection on the part of the European Union, which is something that I and my group find unacceptable. Of course measures need to be taken today to control migratory flows, but the defensive actions that have just been voted on are not a proper response to economic migration or to climate migration, which will not be long in coming. If the European Union, the European Parliament, the Commission and the Council were to provide the development aid that is so essentially needed then perhaps we would be entitled to react in this way, but we are not there yet. Where we are at, in fact, is 0.38% of the budget instead of 0.42%, after having planned for 0.7%. Let me say this in all seriousness: I am ashamed for our Parliament and I am ashamed for the European Union that we are seeking to build, which should be a Union that is open and hospitable and that is able to welcome into its fold all citizens of the world.

Mr President, the White Paper on Sport, following on from the own-initiative report on the future of professional football, known as the Belet report, is a substantial and necessary document. It was time for the European Parliament and the European Commission to tackle the issue of sport. However, good intentions are not enough to cope with the scourges and problems threatening our sports. In the face of scourges such as racism, mafia-style groups, violence inside and outside sports facilities, doping and the purchase of young disposable players from Africa or elsewhere, action is needed! Given the difficulties such as the management of huge sums of money – notably in football but in other sports, too – the existence of agents of all types – agents for players, clubs, coaches – the dictates of ratings, the liberalisation of gambling, we need clear directives that allow for continuity and the development of European sports federations and leagues at both amateur and professional level. Sport, the economy, finance, employment, diplomacy: today these are all closely related. Athletes should not have to pay the price even if they are also citizens who can and must act in good conscience. It is up to the politicians to assume their responsibilities. The European Union will have to do so at the Olympic Games in China in order to reaffirm that respect for cultures, for local religious beliefs and for democracy are essential and non-negotiable. We will vote in favour of the report by Mr Mavrommatis on the White Paper on sport as it is an excellent report.

Mr President, we are nonetheless in a rather surprising situation. We are celebrating the 50th anniversary of the creation of the European Union, and, if we explained to our fellow citizens that the European Union is no longer concerned for one second with sport, they would be surprised. It was therefore time for the European Union to take up this issue, and to do so as we have done, I believe, in the European Parliament. I should like to thank the main rapporteur, Mr Belet, for the way in which he has worked for six months on this report, a joint piece of work between various committees and between various democratic political groups of this Parliament. We have therefore taken up this issue with the aim, which I believe is shared by this Parliament, to respect both the European ‘exception’ regarding sport, not least in comparison to the way in which professional sport is managed in the United States, and the various bodies and organisations in charge of professional football: federations, professional leagues, players’ associations, agents’ groups and so on. I believe that, at this level, this report is useful if we succeed in gaining support for these positions among the various organisations and in thereby enabling them to make this report, on which we are going to vote tomorrow, their own. I believe that our exchanges back and forth with these organisations, which paid an enormous amount of attention to the matter, have been very interesting, and have enabled us to come up with a number of proposals. We therefore welcome, and I think everyone else will do the same, the various recommendations and proposals concerning the training of players, the training of young players and UEFA’s efforts in this regard to prevent young players from being sold straightaway and to enable them to play at the clubs under which they have trained. We welcome the recommendation concerning what might be referred to as ‘trafficking in young players’, whereby hundreds of young African players are used, with there being no plans in place for them afterwards. We welcome the fact that this report points out that immigration laws are made to be complied with, even in the world of professional sport, even in the world of football. We also welcome, as the Commissioner said, the repeated demand for crucial social dialogue. As Mr Belet pointed out, the financial sums at stake, today, in professional football, are exponential – huge – and there is a need, in this regard, for social dialogue, and clearly for regulation and redistribution. There is one criticism, however, which was voiced today, and I am surprised by it. Everyone, including all of the committees, is talking about financial transparency. Today, I heard some of my fellow Members voice the idea that the simple act of saying it was enough. No, the proposal to create an independent organisation – under the auspices of UEFA, perhaps, but independent – would enable us genuinely to move in the direction of financial control and financial transparency. That is the only solution. Repeating it is not enough. It is like saying, on the subject of doping, that we need to combat doping, but without creating any national, European or international body to do so. We must not be hypocritical: we need such a body. I see that I have come to the end of my speaking time. I still had many things left to say. I also welcome, of course, the fight against discrimination and the fight against racism, these being subjects that are regularly taken up by the European Parliament and the Commission, as well as by the football world as a whole.

Mr President, Commissioner, there is no doubt that Parliament has done a huge amount of work on this directive and that this text bears very little relation to the directive proposed by the Commission two years ago. However, as we have just heard in this House, the fact that the European Council changed a number of important sentences after first reading means that the second reading does not go far enough, which is a pity. Thus employees, our fellow citizens and consumers no longer really see the need for a directive on services. It is difficult for them to understand today that liberalisation is taking place without there being anything precise on social services and health services. There is still too much vagueness, too many grey areas, in this compromise proposed by the Commission and the European Council.

Mr President, Mr Barroso, ladies and gentlemen, on behalf of the Group of the Greens/European Free Alliance, I request that, during Thursday’s vote, we schedule an interruption of the sitting just before the final vote. Parliament and the Commission ought to erect a statue of Mr Bolkestein, the most famous European in 2005 and 2006, so that everyone remembers that we no longer want a proposal of this kind, based on an initiative of the European Commission. Admittedly, we have moved on today from the stage we were at with the initial Bolkestein Directive: our parliamentary committees have worked, and they have worked hard. Is that a good enough reason, however, to accept this compromise? I – indeed, we - genuinely do not think so. There are still too many grey areas in this text, not least where the opportunities for monitoring labour law, environmental law and consumer law are concerned. We cannot accept services of general economic interest, social services or social housing being affected by this directive. If the aim is to restore confidence among all of our fellow citizens, who increasingly doubt the part played by European integration in improving their everyday lives, then we must quickly switch to a real form of upwards social harmonisation, not least by making it our priority to draft a directive that defines the notions of European public service.

 Mr President, this resolution is, of course, moving in the right direction. At the last Olympic Games, we all saw a certain number of athletes – very few, in fact, compared to the thousands of competitors taking part – being caught for having taken a few doses of banned substances. These were mainly old doping products, and not particularly the new preparations available these days. It is clear that the first thing we have to do is to adopt an attitude of defending the public health of our athletes, elite athletes, professional athletes. However, there is a contradiction at this level, as we saw recently. The World Anti-doping Agency, which undertakes some very important work, has just decided, with regard to corticosteroids in particular, that tests will be performed and that a certain level – I believe it is 30% – of corticosteroids will be accepted in the samples taken. They are, therefore, taking a stand against the medical profession, a stand that comes down to accepting a certain dose. This reminds us, and certainly reminds me, that, with regard to haematocrit in the world of professional cycling, a level less than or equal to 50% is accepted, but no more. One demand is missing from our resolution. This demand will be expensive, but it is essential: we must provide permanent, independent medical monitoring for athletes. In this way, we will be able to see, regardless of the age of the sportsperson and the sport played, how athletes look after themselves throughout their career, right from the start – because athletes, too, have the right to look after themselves – and what legal, and unfortunately illegal, drugs they could have taken. If we do not have an instrument of this type in the field of doping, in Europe, in the European Union and in the world, then nothing we have said will count for much, as long as we do not have this independent, ongoing medical monitoring.

 Mr President, Commissioner, we find neither the form nor the content of what has happened acceptable. We have heard the Commission’s reply. It is the usual reply of employers to laid-off employees, to the effect that all the conventions have been respected. In fact, that is not the case. Rather, this is a genuine labour dispute. These language teachers have worked for the Commission for decades. They have trained various Commissioners in the languages of the various countries, and yet they are being kicked out. That is not acceptable. I cannot believe for one single moment that the Commission might be compared to what are known pejoratively in France as the bosses. That is not possible. This is a labour dispute, so there need to be more negotiations and further discussion. I can well believe that there are unavoidable issues of progressive externalisation, but a few years might have been allowed to elapse before progressive externalisation led to language teachers within the Commission being dismissed. Where most of them were concerned, a delay of five, six or ten years would have been in order. There have, therefore, to be discussions in a dispute such as this. For my part, I believe that, if the Commission wants attention to be paid to its views on the social dimension, which is defended by the European Parliament and by Europe as a whole, then there has to be discussion, and the Commission has, today in particular, a duty, at this level, to set an impeccable example.

 Mr President, Mr Frattini, I should like to pick up on two points. It strikes me that a much stricter regulation is required on the purchase of young players. We have recently read in the press that players of six and seven years old have been bought by two clubs, Real Madrid and Manchester United. I feel that, in this case, the purchase of young players has gone way too far, even if this is, of course, sanctioned by the families. I believe that transferring players under the age of 16 should be banned and that priority should be attached to training clubs. Every country has perfectly good training schools, and we must make sure that they are able to keep their young players up to a certain age. Nor can we any longer accept the fact that young African players are brought to the EU on full charters and that only a few are taken on and all of the others completely abandoned. My second point is about acknowledging what is happening in our stadia – in Italy, France, Spain, the Netherlands and elsewhere – and acknowledging the acts of xenophobia and racism that happen there. I feel that we need to address this issue. This is a question for the Council, although it also concerns the Commission, in my opinion.

 Mr President, it strikes me that we have finally emerged from ignorance, hypocrisy and demonisation in the area of drug use in sport. It is perfectly clear, Mrs Reding, that you have done an excellent job of finally establishing a genuine fight against drug use, at European level and at world level. The main problem is, indeed, that of our athletes’ health, particularly the health of professional or high-level athletes, and at that level, we would of course need more time to see how, from zero tolerance, we could also achieve a genuine public health policy that enabled our athletes in high-level competition to be up to the level required. What needs to be done is, therefore, a matter of medicalisation and of seeing how, with the doctors at our disposal, particularly independent doctors, and with regular independent checks, we can effectively achieve a genuine public health policy.

Mr President, now that my fellow Members have reminded us of the somewhat difficult progress of this excellent initiative, we hope that it will start to take a more concrete form. For my part, Commissioner, I should like to question you on two points. Firstly, it is said that some of the finance for the additional funds will be provided by drawing on the funds dedicated to the stability instrument, which was set up for the purposes of conflict prevention and the consolidation of peace. This redeployment appears to me to be extremely problematic. Has it been confirmed? And if it has, will any compensation be envisaged? I imagine that you will no doubt also be concerned with the long-term future of this instrument of instability. Secondly, now that this EUR 1 billion seems to have been raised, what channels will be employed to ensure that the funds are moved quickly and effectively to the many different and widely spread actors in the field, as well as to the hundreds of family-based agricultural organisations? How do you intend to deal directly with these actors in the field and avoid the waste and loss which, as we well know, are associated with the presence of many different intermediaries?

Mr President, Commissioner, Mr Barnier, European Development Days have been held over the last three days, during which frequent reference was made to the food crisis that is seriously affecting the poorest countries. All the speeches emphasised the prevailing need for developing countries to develop their own agriculture by making optimal use of their land and natural resources. Incidentally, the lyrical musings of those who, yesterday and again today, called for a reduction in state intervention and public spending, all-out liberalisation, privatisation and the relegation of agriculture to an almost prehistoric activity, this U-turn, therefore, in favour of huge public investment in agricultural production and food sovereignty, all seemed simultaneously laughable and scandalous. The future of agriculture in developing countries is directly linked to our debate today. Unfortunately I do not feel that this common agricultural policy (CAP) health check, which was begun before the food riots and the disastrous disruption of the markets reached their peak, takes account of the situation of the farming community in the South or draws the full conclusions from the serious crises that we now face in ecological, social, economic and financial terms. I am therefore very sorry that the robust relationship between northern and southern agriculture receives so little attention, both in the Commission’s proposals and in Parliament’s report, and the jeopardising of the EUR 1 billion pledged shows that there is still a long way to go.
 Marie-Hélène Aubert,

Mr President, Commissioner, as you have recalled, this structural crisis is both deep and enduring. It therefore calls for solutions that will also endure, not just for the fisheries industry but for all the sectors concerned. It also has to be said that the current crisis is precisely the result of years of blindness to the reliance of the fisheries sector on fuel – and cheap fuel at that – and to the headlong rush to a kind of arms race, with ever more powerful vessels that can go out further and further and bring back ever greater quantities of fish. These are also some of the issues that we have to tackle. The problem of expensive fuel oil is inseparable from all the other questions that affect the fisheries sector – management of fish stocks, pricing policies, world trade, the control of illegal fishing – and it is difficult to deal with this issue in isolation from the rest. The subsidies and aid that the Commission is proposing to provide, and which appear to me to be going in the right direction, will only be acceptable – especially as far as the public is concerned – if they are dependent on an in-depth reorientation of fishery policies and fishery practices. For our part, we regret that the joint compromise resolution does not in fact lay down conditions for the aid and subsidies that can be granted for this reorientation and for the obligation to put an end to fleet overcapacity and to move towards a better management of the fishery stocks and better protection of the marine ecosystems. What is more, this is the very condition on which the economic and social viability of the fisheries depends. Finally, we would like to see the Member States assuming full responsibility of their own and ending the demagogic practice of promising money they do not have without putting forward any sustainable policies for the fisheries industry.
 Marie-Hélène Aubert,

Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, as you know, the fisheries sector is experiencing a serious crisis at present, not just because of the increase in the price of diesel, for which sustainable, global proposals must be put forward and not just temporary solutions, but also because of the poor management of fisheries resources, over-fishing by the European fishing fleet and the increase in the number of products of illegal fishing that find their way onto the European market. This highly lucrative illegal fishing speeds up the deterioration of fish resources and marine ecosystems and destabilises the entire sector, which is feeling the full force of this unfair competition. The proposal by the European Commission and this report are thus essential elements in the implementation of sustainable, responsible fishing that enables European fishermen to earn a living. This report was adopted unanimously in the Committee on Fisheries. Our aim today is to send a strong signal to the Council, to the most closely involved Member States, which must today take full responsibility and implement the necessary rapid, effective measures. I am counting on your determination.
 Marie-Hélène Aubert,  
rapporteur. – (FR)
 Madam President, the events unfolding this very day in Brussels show us to what extent the future of European fisheries is under threat if the European Union is incapable of implementing the sustainable management of fish stocks and root-and-branch reform of its existing policies. The fight against IUU fishing is a major element of this more demanding and coherent policy. However, the globalisation of trade, the free movement of capital, and advances in transport and communication have all led to a significant increase in illegal fishing over recent years. Today the situation is no longer tenable. European fishermen, like all stakeholders, including NGOs, are unanimously calling for this phenomenon – which hastens the destruction of resources and results in unfair competition for those who play by the rules – to be tackled more effectively. However, that is not to say that Member States have not been able to monitor and sanction illegal practices, as they should have done. In this respect, the report of the Court of Auditors published a few months ago is damning. This is why the European Commission’s ambitious proposal announced last October was particularly well received by the Committee on Fisheries, which had already adopted, by an overwhelming majority, an own-initiative report on the EU’s February 2007 action plan to combat IUU fishing. In fact, we are delighted that the Commission’s legislative proposal incorporates most of our recommendations. These include the publication of an IUU vessels list; reinforced port state controls; compulsory catch certificates for the flag state and therefore the refusal to import fisheries products obtained from IUU fishing into the EU; reinforced and harmonised sanctions, and a Community alert system. Therefore, there is not much missing from the Commission’s proposal. However, as you know, three points have been the subject of a heated debate within the Council, particularly concerning the scope of the regulation. For my part, I am delighted that we have finally managed to secure the scope that you have proposed, which extends to both Community and third-country vessels. The catch certificate has also been considered too cumbersome or complex, and the level and nature of the sanctions have also been fiercely debated. These issues were also raised within our committee. However, our amendments have, I think, finally helped to clarify the text while preserving the ambition and major goals of the new regulation. The report was adopted by unanimous vote and I would like to thank my colleagues for their support, which helped to secure this outcome. With a sector in crisis, the European Parliament wants to send out a very strong signal today, aimed particularly at the Council, which has been too slow to shoulder its responsibilities in this area. Commissioner, the fight against IUU fishing is still only part of the wider policy including the Control Regulation and that of serious offences. This divide has not helped to clarify the proceedings, to say the least. We are still waiting for clarification from you on how these three new regulations are to be structured. Similarly, concerns over the complexity of the catch certificate are just an excuse to dilute or postpone the text. We need universally comprehensible procedures which can be operated by a sufficient number of reliable, efficient and competent staff, and are accessible to developing countries, who in any case are the main victims of IUU fishing. On this too we expect clarification and a commitment from you. Finally, we are counting, Commissioner, on your resolve – which we know is considerable – to put a swift end to illegal fishing, which affects bluefin tuna and cod most of all, highly prized species which are heavily overfished at present. This at least would give a concrete response to the serious problems currently faced by the fishing industry. There is still a great deal of work to be done, as you know, to ensure a sustainable future for European fisheries. However, an important step will be taken in the coming weeks, and I am as pleased about this as you are.
 Marie-Hélène Aubert,  
rapporteur. – (FR)
 Madam President, I would first of all like to thank the Commissioner and everyone who took part in this debate. Obviously we have also covered the background to the serious crisis currently affecting the sector. I should like to thank the Commissioner for trying to give precise answers to the questions raised on this subject, even though it is clearly difficult to go into detail in some areas. In any case, it is unfortunate that the European Union – or Brussels – should be systematically blamed for everything. I actually believe that this would be a good opportunity to show that the European Union – Brussels – is not part of the problem, but part of the solution. Admittedly, when we see the resentment that exists towards the European Union, we realise to what extent Member States and a number of industry members have shirked their responsibilities over the years, prioritising short-term interests, thinking that they can profit from these for a while, but refusing to see that, by doing so, they led an entire sector to the brink of disaster. This is where we are now. How can we find instant solutions to a situation that has dragged on for years? It is not easy. You have made a few suggestions. However, we will not succeed if we do not take strict and drastic measures, if we do not employ all of the necessary means, because these texts will not be enforced without financial and human resources, adopting much more dissuasive sanctions than those that currently exist with regard to illegal fishing. This at least will not be too hard, considering the low number of fines recently imposed. We also need to provide much more encouragement and reward for intelligent and sustainable behaviour and practices. Often, those fishermen and fishing enterprises who are adopting practices that are both extremely compliant and innovative in terms of sustainable fisheries management feel that they go unrecognised and unrewarded. I also believe that, both in terms of the fight against illegal fishing and other areas that have been covered, such as waste or resource management and quotas, we also need to come up with a much more rewarding strategy, one that is forward-looking and a step in the right direction, which does not currently seem to me to be the case. To conclude, I believe that this report is a chance for us to raise all of these issues. Clearly, having this discussion alone will not solve the problems. I imagine that this discussion will continue in the next report, although it is about time that we had a broad consultation and ended the top-down negotiations between the Commission, governments and industry representatives and had a much wider, more horizontal, cross-disciplinary consultation. This would provide us with answers and the European Union and Parliament would again be allowed to fulfil their role and embrace their duty to find solutions for this sector in crisis.

 Mr President, the European Union, the international community, the IMF and the World Bank are raising the alarm, are joining forces, which is good, considering the current food crisis. However, they are acting like pyromaniac fire-fighters. I think that we still need to review the policies that have been adopted in the north and south over the last 20 years: structural adjustment plans implemented by leading international financial institutions, which have undermined the ability of States to organise and regulate their own economies, the withdrawal from and lack of interest in agriculture in the context of public development aid, deregulation, the sudden liberalisation of global trade and financial flows that has led to a form of ecological social dumping and speculation. What makes me uncomfortable is that we offer advice and recommend solutions, but have not really criticised what has been done in previous decades. Therefore, rather than talking about food security, we should allow the countries concerned, particularly in Africa, to develop their own agriculture, to organise their own regional markets and to protect these, yes, protect them in some way, just as the European Union did when it developed its common agricultural policy. To do this, we also need to listen more to farmers’ associations in these countries, which are taking action, which have ideas, which have simple demands that could be supported with resources that are not necessarily extortionate. Let us start, first of all, by listening to people on the ground who are proposing a whole series of initiatives that deserve to be encouraged and supported, especially by the European Union.

 Mr President, the human rights situation and situation of the civilian population is still critical in Chad, and no initiative towards political dialogue has any chance of succeeding if we do not first have a clear response concerning the fate of the members of the opposition arrested on 3 February, and if there is no end to the violence that always occurs, even as we speak, against those whom Idriss Déby brutally sees as adversaries to be eliminated. That is why, Commissioner, it is vital you keep up the pressure as you have in the past in order to force Idriss Déby to say where Ibni Mahamat Saleh in particular is, and what has become of him, and to release him if he is still alive. I wish to take this opportunity to welcome and express my solidarity with his son, present today in the galleries, and the parliamentary representative, Mr Yorongar, who has come to talk to us on his country’s situation and future. Commissioner, Mr President-in-Office, ladies and gentlemen, the Chadian diaspora, very much present in Strasbourg today, is listening carefully to you and is relying on you to produce inclusive dialogue that does not exclude any political players in Chad. It is under these conditions that the prospects for peace and a democratic process are possible, in association with all parties, and under these conditions that EUFOR may finally deploy in the best conditions, thus emerging from the ambiguity and uncertainty brought about by recent events. The EU’s role must be fully clarified I relation to France’s role in this region, which has clearly allowed Idriss Déby to remain in power, even if the discourse employed by the French President has now become more open and calls for changes to previous policies. Commissioner, Mr President, you must use your considerable potential for pressure to obtain genuine assurances and protection for all democrats in Chad, and thus take a more demanding attitude with President Déby, who at the present time is merely attempting to gain some time and save face.

 Mr President, Commissioner, the context of agriculture has changed a great deal since 2003, and the analyses we have today are already out of date and not really up to the crucial challenges of the future. Demand for food products is exploding, prices are rising fast and becoming unaffordable for those most hard up, and at the same time agricultural land is disappearing. Biofuels, which are subsidised, are vastly destabilising agriculture. Let us also underline the impact of climate change, and above all, the fact that our citizens are questioning the intensive, ultra-liberal industrial model, which means that foods travel thousands of kilometres around the world, all of which is accompanied by social and environmental dumping. An in-depth reform of the common agricultural policy is therefore what we should now be carrying out, and not just a technical adaptation of the current instruments, which is what you are proposing today. What we also really need now is a bearing, a clear strategic direction, which is what we lack most at the moment.

 Mr President, I think that in view of the current situation, the European Union should make an effort to assert its credibility as regards the observation missions it sends to these countries. For if it is observed quite seriously, as was the case, that the result is clearly fraudulent, that the president cannot be considered the legitimately elected president, the European Union should then be consistent in its policy and start, at the very least, by not recognising the president, in this case Mr Kibaki. Secondly, the EU should propose and ensure, as rapidly as possible, that new presidential elections are held that will enable the president to be properly elected, honestly this time. Sadly, we have precedents, notably in Ethiopia where the President also used force to get himself into office, despite the evidence of fraud followed by much repressive violence. The European Union’s acceptance of this fait accompli helps to undermine the value of sending observation missions. What is the point of sending European observation missions with the seriousness and commitment of all our colleagues in this area to make conclusions that are unanimously recognised by everyone, if in the end we lie low and a few months later accept a coup by a president who will not even listen? Would we accept this kind of situation in our own countries? Obviously not. Therefore we cannot, in terms of the democracy and electoral processes we support, have double standards, one applying in the European Union and the other fluctuating in line with peoples’ interests in these regions. The Kenyan people, I believe, want to get to the bottom of this situation and are calling for new elections to make things perfectly clear.

Mr President, Commissioner, we certainly agree with your wish to put an end to subsidies that encourage overproduction and have unacceptable perverse effects, but we cannot accept the fact you intend to make wine, which is first and foremost attached to a terroir
 and an increasingly standardised product sold all over the world, subject to the whims of fashion and marketing. I wish to highlight two points here. The first the absolute necessity to protect the geographical indications and designations of origin, which are often questioned but nevertheless establish the link to the land that characterises the European agricultural model. We want you to highlight this model and not sacrifice it at the altar of larger markets to the sole benefit of money-grubbers. We also call for more attention to be paid to ecological vine-growing methods, which still require significant various chemical products and additives. In this regard, we would ask you to provide specific support for organic wine, the specifications for which are now being drawn up. Biodiversity of terroirs
, cultures and tastes, development and promotion of quality, and the extraordinary richness of European vines: these are the future and the principles that ought to form the basis of this reform.

 Madam President, in spite of stated intentions we cannot really say that any new elements have been introduced to the debates that have been taking place in recent months on the partnership between the European Union and Africa. Of course peace and the rule of law must be absolute priorities; the EU is now playing an increasing role in this respect and this is only to be welcomed. We also have to ensure that the support provided for the organisation of elections, for example, is subjected to real care and scrutiny so that the communities concerned see the practical benefits that democracy can bring to their everyday lives. As far as the other measures are concerned I would say that all in all the European Union’s proposals are fairly typical, lying somewhere between promoting good governance and free trade, with the accent on economic development and the provision of health care. However, while there are burning issues to be dealt with, these EU-Africa strategies, in our opinion, fail to deal with two key problems. Firstly there is food security, which has to be seen in the context of rising prices for basic foodstuffs, especially cereals, and the upsurge in biofuels, along with the need to protect and develop agriculture, although the next European Development Fund – like most of the governments in Africa – has only allocated a small percentage of its budget to this objective. Even the World Bank recently stressed that a rethink was needed in this area, and that is saying something. The question of food provision has now become absolutely crucial, as has the future of small farmers who are all too often neglected by development aid policies. The second key aspect is that Africa, as you know, is an immense reservoir of natural resources that the African people, unfortunately, are unable to profit from, even though the price of these commodities has risen enormously. All the major economic powers, along with emerging nations like China, are rushing to get their hands on these resources which are becoming increasingly rare. This latter-day gold rush, this hunger for materials, is now having extremely brutal social and environmental repercussions and is continuing to fuel wars and corruption. In the light of all this the European Union is talking in theoretical, even angelic tones, while all the time it too is engaged in exploiting Africa’s natural resources. How then do we rationalise, manage and share access to these reserves in such a way that the communities concerned really derive benefit from them without seeing their environment vandalised? This is a major question and one that the EU-Africa strategy needs to take more seriously, for it will be imposed on us in any case, given the speed of events in this sector.

Madam President, as we all know, the development of Nigeria is crucially important for the African continent. Nigeria is one of the largest countries in Africa and, just as it has done in the Democratic Republic of Congo, the European Union has put effort into organising elections and observing elections there. That being said, the chaotic and violent situation that reigns in Nigeria, especially in the delta region, must open our eyes to a number of issues – obvious and outstanding issues. As in Congo, the issue of the exploitation of raw materials and oil plays an extremely important role in the destabilisation of this country, in the atmosphere of violence and civil war that has come about there. On this point, I believe that we should be very pro-active in supporting the civil society and the democrats, who are fighting to obtain information and transparency on the exploitation of the resources and who are also seeking to preserve their resources. The delta region is totally devastated and plagued by murderous conflicts, and the manœuvres of the Nigerian army in this area sometimes do more harm than good. I also believe that the European Union should be far stricter in making the development aid that it provides conditional on the fight against corruption and on the very clear inclusion in the State budget of the profits made from oil and minerals, because it is all the same absolutely scandalous that the people of Nigeria, who live in a state of great poverty, do not see any benefits whatsoever from these mineral and oil profits! At a time when the price of a barrel of oil has increased, the resources should be considerable. It is therefore most unusual that this issue has not been dealt with. Finally, progress needs to be made, too, concerning the social and environmental responsibility of large companies – Shell, in particular, has a major presence in this country, but it is not the only one – and we should also act together on these major issues, and not just on the matter of organising elections.

Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, my report on organic production and labelling of organic products is finally going to be put to the vote today, firstly after referral back to committee, and then after an urgent request to the Council, which, I might add, was unanimously rejected by our Parliament last month. Unfortunately, the new discussions held over the last two months with the Council have not enabled us to progress further on important points. In particular, neither the Commission nor the Council agreed to the dual legal basis that we were demanding. The Council did not go back on its decision to permit, by special derogation, additives and veterinary treatments made from GMOs. Furthermore, certain chemical substances could also be permitted by derogation. With no codecision, we are forced to acknowledge this state of affairs. We do, however, deplore the uncommunicative and offhand attitude of the Council over the last few weeks, in spite of the good will of some Member States. I just as deeply regret the fact that the majority of the groups refused yesterday to postpone the vote until June, given that the Council itself had postponed its meeting on organic farming. I regret that the majority of the groups did not wish to exhaust the means that we have to apply pressure. That being said, the Council did nevertheless take up a number of our amendments in its compromise, and regular consultation of all the actors concerned is part of the overall agreement. I therefore call on you now to adopt this report. You can count on my determination, and on that of my fellow Members from the Committee on Agriculture and Rural Development, closely to monitor this matter over the next few months. (Applause)

Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, very quickly, I call on all of the groups to reject this request for application of the urgent procedure, which is totally unnecessary. On the one hand, we are talking about a regulation that will only come into force on 1 January 2009, and, on the other hand, the Committee on Agriculture and Rural Development is doing its job perfectly well. It addressed this issue during its last meeting and it will address it again on 7 and 8 May with the aim of making progress in our discussions with the Council. There are still two plenary sessions to be held right here in Strasbourg before the end of the German Presidency, and we have taken things well in hand. We are continuing our discussions. There is therefore no need to vote in favour of this request by the Council to have the urgent procedure applied.

 Mr President, on the basis of Rule 53 of the Rules of Procedure, I would ask that the report be referred back to the committee. Indeed, Amendment 1, which requests a double legal basis - that is to say, Articles 37 and 95 – had extremely broad support in this House, being adopted by 585 votes. Now, the Commissioner replied yesterday that she did not accept this amendment. I therefore think that we must go further in negotiations with the Commission, while retaining the report - which, I am very pleased to say, is constructive - in its present form. We must go further, however, and I therefore ask that the report be referred back to the committee. (Applause)

Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, as you know, the circumstances of organic farming are somewhat paradoxical today. On the one hand, there is growing demand for it because it is a method of farming that creates jobs, protects the environment, biodiversity and, ultimately, everyone’s health. On the other hand, organic farming still accounts for only slightly more than 1% of European agricultural production and slightly more than 3% of usable agricultural area – in other words, little. I believe that it is our responsibility to help develop organic farming within the European Union. This is perhaps only a small issue in terms of quantity, but a huge issue in political and symbolic terms because organic farming is also a kind of breakthrough, in that it refocuses the common agricultural policy on a far more sustainable form of farming, which is what is required. Throughout 2006, we worked on the basis of a Commission proposal that has caused a great deal of concern and given rise to many protests, and a certain hastiness, too, since we were initially asked to give our verdict in two months on a proposal that had not really been developed thoroughly. However, I readily admit that the work has been constructive and that the discussions have taken place regularly, with both the Commission and the Council, to improve the initial proposal. Through all these exchanges, all these discussions and comings and goings, what did this Parliament’s Committee on Agriculture and Rural Development ultimately hope to do? You have pointed out the key elements. Firstly, it hoped to extend the scope of this regulation to non-food products such as textiles and cosmetics, but also, and above all, to mass catering, because mass catering is an extraordinary lever for developing organic farming in our countries. We would be quite wrong not to use it. That is also why we want a dual legal basis – Articles 37 and 95 – which relate to both the internal market and consumption. It would seem that you have nothing but praise for our work, for our contribution and, thus, for the fact that the European Parliament has become far more involved – not to mention codecision, in general, for farming, because that is another debate that we have yet to hold. It therefore seems to me that, if we want to pursue this work, if we want MEPs really to have the right to inspect these famous decrees that are going to play a vital role in the application of this regulation, you should accept this dual legal basis, and we will pursue this debate. Secondly, as you pointed out, we have requested – from what was a vague text – far more precise definitions of what is meant by inspection, certification, products authorised or unauthorised in organic farming practices, the link to the soil, animal conditions, and so on. Next, you raised the very sensitive point of the lack of genetically modified organisms in organic farming. There must be a total absence of these organisms, just as there must be a total absence of pesticides and synthetic chemicals. On the subject of genetically modified organisms, we are absolutely set on confirming to consumers that organic farming does not contain any GMOs, from seed to distribution. The current threshold of 0.9%, which is a labelling exemption threshold, causes confusion. Therefore, in our opinion, we need to return to this issue so that we opt for the detection threshold for both conventional crops and organic farming and also so that, no matter what happens, we take all the measures necessary to prevent any contamination, even adventitious, of biological crops by GMOs. You say that it is not possible to accept the stricter measures that the Member States might take. Well, in our opinion, the specifications of both private and public authorities, which already exist and with which consumers are well acquainted, should be able to stay. In any case, this is what we want, and, if there is any flexibility, harmonisation must be upwards, not downwards, the latter being something that we fear. You have given us a number of answers. I believe that this debate will continue, no doubt beyond tomorrow’s vote. Finally, I should like to conclude by saying that this regulation is not the be-all and end-all, either, and that it is not going to settle all of the issues concerning organic farming. Within the context of the common agricultural policy, we also need far greater support for organic farming than we have at present.

Mr President, I too should like to highlight the discrepancy between the seriousness of the issue being dealt with and this practically deserted Chamber, and that is without mentioning the absence of the Council; while the Commission is at least represented, our action in relation to this matter is certainly not, in any event, equal to the challenges. As I was saying, the Council is absent, but when one reads its conclusions of 12 February, that is to say, those written exactly two days ago, its absence does not change a great deal anyway. I shall read and quote what is written in these conclusions:  ‘The Council remains gravely concerned about the security situation in Darfur’ – to say the least – ‘and condemns continued ceasefire violations by all parties.’  – (FR) 
That is the kind of particularly forceful sentence that the Council is capable of producing after months and months of resolutions, decisions and diplomatic meetings, when the situation is more disastrous now than it ever has been. We therefore clearly believe that a change of level is required and, indeed, that more pressure must be exerted with regard to this unacceptable situation. What about the punishments that were decided on for the Sudanese leaders, and for all these war criminals? What is the European Union doing with regard to these punishments? It seems to me, in any case, that the European Union has a number of options available to it to freeze financial resources so as to prevent all these people from moving freely about our territory. Ways of exerting pressure do exist. What are we doing with regard to United Nations Resolution 1706, which has the backing of the European Union? What initiatives have been taken by the European Commission and the Council to put pressure on all those responsible for this situation? What credibility do we have today to issue a multitude of texts that, at least on the part of the Council, and even of the Commission, merely restate our grave concerns regarding this situation? Only a very short time ago, the Chinese President, Hu Jintao, visited several African countries and, more specifically, Sudan. What is the Union’s position faced with this situation, with the new and emerging role of China’s leaders? Faced, too, with the importance of access to raw materials, and to oil in particular? Thus, when one sees the inertia, the powerlessness, of the European institutions on this issue, what conclusions must be drawn? Does this mean that, if priority is to be given to accessing raw materials or oil, which in reality is gradually dwindling, and if it is to be given to the large markets represented by countries such as China, the values of human rights and the duty that we actually have to protect civilian populations need to be put on the back burner? Is that what this means? I believe that it would be absolutely tragic for the European Union to come to that. The fact is that these issues are being raised on a daily basis, and we constantly find ourselves incapable and powerless in the face of this tragic situation. It is therefore high time a formal sitting bringing together the Council, the Commission and Parliament was organised – and organised very soon – on this issue, in Brussels or Strasbourg, so that the necessary decisions can finally be taken.

Mr President, illegal fishing is a trend that is developing extensively today and seriously harming the activities of European fisheries, local fishing communities and fisheries in developing countries, not least in those with which the European Community has concluded fishing agreements. It is also an activity that, I am afraid to say, is extremely lucrative. I would cite the example of bluefin tuna, particularly in the Mediterranean, specimens of which are sold at absolutely astronomical prices. We therefore find ourselves in a vicious circle, which leads to the gradual, though accelerated, depletion of fishery resources. Legal fisheries – those that comply with the regulations – are, for their part, very heavily penalised by these illegal activities, which can, in fact, be defined in fairly broad terms. We are talking about illegal, unregulated, undeclared fishing. That therefore relates to many activities: pirate fishing, the use of unauthorised fishing gear, the catching of unauthorised species, unlicensed fishing and the policy of transferring cargo at sea from one boat to another. The scope of the illegal activities is extremely broad. What, then, is the purpose of this own-initiative report? In 2002, the FAO launched an international action plan against illegal fishing, which was subsequently replaced by a European Union action plan, which was adopted by the Council in 2002. The plan was unfortunately implemented in a variety of ways, at different levels, by the Member States. At this very moment, the European Commission is working on evaluating the Member States' action plans on the fight against illegal fishing ahead of the meeting of the FAO – the FAO's Committee on Fisheries – which will be held in the first week of March, in Rome, and which will be an opportunity to re-launch the international action plan against illegal fishing. The European Union has a huge responsibility in this area. Why? Firstly, because the European Union is ranked third in the world in terms of fishing activities, after China and Peru. It has one of the world’s largest fleets. Moreover, it largely resorts to using flags of convenience, which cause a huge number of problems, not only for fishing, but also for maritime transport. Finally, the EU is also one of the world’s largest markets in fish. The responsibilities are therefore many. The Commission’s response to us is that this whole business is complex, many parties come into play, nothing can be done by working alone, it is expensive, one cannot ask some Member States to comply with a number of rules and not ask the others to do the same, and so on. The pretexts and excuses for the lacklustre results are legion and, sadly, there have not been enough initiatives to fight effectively against this activity of illegal fishing which, once again, has developed at an extremely serious rate over the last few years. The responsibilities are as much those of the port States, as they are called, as they are of the flag States or the States in which fishery products are marketed. There are in fact many levels: that of the regional fisheries organisations, that of the Member States, the European level; it is at all these levels that action must be taken, across the board, with the involvement of the Directorate-General for Fisheries and the Directorate-General for the Environment, the Directorate-General for Development and the Directorate-General for Trade. Hard work is therefore what is required here, but only action on the part of all these administrations and these political officials will prove truly effective. What are the key measures in my report, which, I might add, has been unanimously adopted within the Committee on Fisheries, showing that this is indeed a concern shared by all of our Member States? There is the traceability of fishery products and the introduction of blacklists, that is to say, of lists of boats that are not authorised to fish or that have already been punished for illegal fishing activities. We should condemn today the lack of coordination and cooperation between the various sources of information regarding these boats, which are authorised or unauthorised to fish. Among the important measures, I should also mention those that consist in preventing illegal fishing products from being landed and marketed on the European market, and then, finally, the actions to be carried out in the field of European and international law. There are, in fact, legal vacuums today that prevent the crews of vessels carrying out illegal fishing activities from being challenged and punished. To conclude, it is absolutely vital that we have a more integrated European policy, in terms both of control and monitoring and of penalties. It is from this global perspective that the report outlines a number of initiatives and proposes a number of measures that we are discussing here, with a view to the FAO meeting, in March, within the context of which it is crucial for us to appear far more proactive and far more dynamic.

 Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, it is a few months ago now since we were taken by surprise by the agreement on wine concluded with the United States, on which we had to call for an urgent debate and which already contained some of the bad ingredients of the reform you are proposing today: weakening of the European criteria for wine quality, confusion over geographical indications and designations of origin, acceptance of highly questionable oenological practices, greater opening of the market, which will benefit standardised products that are thought to be to the taste of the equally standardised world consumer. Undoubtedly merchants and exporters will benefit, but the development of products with intimate cultural links to their local area certainly will not; neither will the diversity and the very rich flavours of European wines, nor the consumer, who will soon be forced to swill concoctions that hardly deserve to be called wine, and certainly not the winegrowers who work hard, sometimes in difficult regions and on small areas, to maintain a high quality of wine and the pleasure of drinking it. Alright, let us put an end to the most absurd mechanisms that encourage overproduction and have too many perverse effects, but please, Commissioner, fight with us and put in place the resources to promote quality wines, to make the most of the variety of flavours and territories, to preserve the soil and biodiversity and to tell the whole world about the wonderful alchemy of European wine that has existed for over 2 000 years.

 Mr President, Commissioner, you rightly pointed out that, in spite of the as yet minimal progress made when it comes to access to treatment, the disease is, unfortunately, not on the decline. On the contrary: in our own countries, in particular, the epidemic has, rather, gained ground. We are therefore delighted about the consensus taking shape in this House concerning the need definitely to review the TRIPS agreement on access to medicines, since the arrangements provided for within the framework of the Doha round do not, unfortunately, at present permit real access to inexpensive medicines. That being said, the problem of AIDS is not only a problem of funding and of access to medicines. It might even be said that the emphasis placed on access to medicines has no doubt eclipsed the need to go on ceaselessly promoting prevention, which is now in decline both in our own countries and everywhere else. It is therefore essential to resume the prevention and information campaigns via the media, enlisting the help of qualified personnel, as well as on the social and medical networks, with a view to raising people’s awareness. Secondly – and this is something that you have pointed out and something that is no doubt the most difficult thing to achieve – we also need, if we are really to change the situation, to alter cultural practices when it comes to sexuality and, in particular, to protect women and enable women to protect themselves. Women now constitute 50% of patients, which was not the case at the beginning of the epidemic. They are also affected in an extremely brutal and violent way not only by cruel treatment and other practices that take place in time of war in conflict zones but also by rape, prostitution, trafficking in women and female sexual slavery – all scourges that help facilitate the growth of the epidemic. Consequently, the way in which the European Union promotes women’s rights and equality also constitutes a very effective way of combating the epidemic and focusing on the transmission of the disease from mother to child – a mode of transmission that is rarely mentioned at present. Innovative solutions do exist in some countries – for example, Malawi - where, by proceeding on the basis of decentralisation so as to get closer to the people and by also arranging for an active role to be played by the patients themselves – those whose condition has been stabilised – extremely positive results are achieved. This even applies in extremely poverty-stricken countries. We must therefore make much further progress on all these levels.

Mr President, unfortunately, where Darfur is concerned, the resolutions and the declarations have been following on from one another for several years now with, it would seem, little to no success. As has been pointed out, the abuses continue, the acts of violence are on the increase and the women and children are the main victims of these crimes and these atrocities. This situation is totally unbearable. Faced with that, there seems to be a growing sense of powerlessness or fatalism, but we have a duty to get involved now so that we can make genuine progress on the ground. In fact, the more time that goes by, the more the government in Khartoum thinks that it can act with impunity and says to itself that, in the end, by digging its heels in and by gaining time, it will achieve its ends. If we want to act, then, it seems that there are three priorities to fulfil. Firstly, the top priority is to gain access to the refugees because, right now, thousands of people are in fact suffering from hunger and violence, and no one can gain access to these populations: it is this situation that must be improved as a matter of urgency. The second priority is the fight against impunity. It is unacceptable that, despite the declarations and the vague desire for sanctions, nothing has ended up being done. The criminals and those who are growing considerably richer continue to go about their business as though nothing were wrong, and little has been done in that regard. The third and final priority is, of course, the establishment, as quickly as possible, of a United Nations force that can go and strengthen that of the African Union, which is all the same playing an important role that should be consolidated. So, admittedly, here we are now obliged to call on China and Russia to play a positive role in this affair, even though everyone knows that China and Russia are perhaps not examples of the ideal to aspire to when it comes to respect for human rights or for the populations affected by such conflicts. Furthermore, we must, at the same time, call for a general dialogue, as the previous speaker pointed out. Finally, I have a few words to say about the role of oil in this affair. We are not burying our heads in the sand. We know only too well that oil stirs up conflicts, excites envy, enables people to buy weapons and also leads to standstills, particularly on the part of China - which has very important interests in that area – and of all those, and the superpowers in particular, that are now searching ever more feverishly for oil resources to which they can have easy access. We will therefore have to integrate this issue of access to oil into a much broader, European and international, context.

 Commissioner, the counterfeiting of medicines is, indeed, a particularly serious scourge and one that, unfortunately, is not new and that has even been known about for several years. It might therefore be hoped that our fellow Member’s timely question will finally lead to some results. That being said, the main motive for counterfeiting medicines has to do with the fact that they are much too highly priced for poor countries and their populations. The first tactic should therefore consist in ensuring that poor countries and the most impoverished populations have access to generic medicines. This is something that my fellow Member has spoken about. Generic medicines still do not have a significant enough place on the medicines market. Furthermore, I would not want the fight against counterfeiting to consist in reinforcing the protection of patents in the pharmaceutical sphere and so protecting the future development of the already considerable profits made by the pharmaceutical industry in many sectors. The priority is, therefore, to encourage the development of public health policies in the countries concerned, as well as to encourage the establishment of states governed by the rule of law. That is indeed the priority. Nothing is possible unless viable states and public health policies are established enabling, in particular, medicines to be monitored and pharmacies to be set up in accordance with properly laid down rules. This issue of a public health policy is one basic element, the other being prevention. Indeed, health is not just about medicines. In other words, swallowing medicines is not the only route to good health. For example, unclean drinking water is at present a cause of death in a number of developing countries. Another example relates to AIDS. The counterfeiting of medicines is highly developed in this area, and the recently held Onusida conference placed great emphasis on prevention. It is therefore also through policies of prevention, information and education and by relying on the practical knowledge present in local communities that attempts might be made to solve the problem and not merely through putting dozens of substances on the market at prohibitive prices. In conclusion, I think that, in the fight against counterfeiting, we have to begin by strengthening existing measures and coordinating them better. Then, we must above all help the developing, or poorest, countries to establish viable states and to put public policies in place covering all health problems and not only that of access to medicines.

Mr President, Commissioner, the European Union has committed itself financially and politically, with a great deal of determination, to the electoral process in the Democratic Republic of Congo, and we can only be delighted at that. The same goes for the desire expressed by the Congolese people to finally be able to choose their leaders by themselves, and for Europe’s support in this area, provided that this support is perceived as being completely neutral, something that has posed problems recently. That being said, the situation remains very tense, and while it is clear that these elections seem to be necessary or urgent, after so many years of war, chaos and victims, they will not be enough to put right a country that still has serious problems, starting with extreme poverty and a high level of violence, which regularly undermine the efforts to establish the rule of law. Controlling the trafficking and trade in weapons, setting up an effective police force and judicial system and bringing the most serious criminals before the International Criminal Court are the requirements for consolidating peace. This situation of impunity has just as serious an effect on health issues. Besides the shortage of health care personnel to which Doctor Mukwege, who practises in the west of Congo, drew our attention in Brussels, in May, there are also the mass rapes and inhumane treatment inflicted on women that must be combated relentlessly. This must be done by also relying on the abilities of the local communities to organise themselves, to restore acceptable daily living conditions, and to denounce and punish acts of violence. Will the new elected leaders of DRC be able to put a stop to this violence? It is justifiable to be worried, especially given the unrest that followed the announcement of the presidential election results, which do, however, still offer an opportunity to both of the candidates who finished first in the elections. In the event of serious unrest, what exactly would EUFOR’s mandate be? Finally, the mineral and forestry resources in DRC are now the subject of shameless exploitation, whereby corruption more often than not goes hand in hand with a disastrous social and environmental impact. The answers that will be given, not only by the elected Congolese authorities, but also by the European Union’s political and economic partners, in relation to transparency, to the way in which profits are used, and to social and ecological conditions of exploitation, will be key to determining whether or not DRC is capable of taking action in favour of sustainable development. How do you see things in this area, Commissioner? If one takes account of the events that took place in DRC, then to put in place a democratic and peaceful transition would constitute a strong sign of hope for the thousands of Africans who are now fleeing their countries in order to make a dash for Europe’s shores with the idea of thus escaping from the chaos and of ensuring their own survival. In any case, everything must be done to give the Democratic Republic of Congo and the millions of Congolese people, who have suffered so much and who have reacted with so much energy and vigour, their chance.

Mr President, I too would like to thank Mrs Carlotti for this report, which proposes many interesting initiatives, though, as the Commissioner has pointed out, there appears to be a lack of coherence amongst the different policies of the European Union. During this part-session we have dealt with a number of reports on issues such as asylum, immigration and development which in some cases take us in contradictory directions. We must acknowledge that today, in our countries, the prevailing tendency is towards securitarianism. There is an excessive tendency to link immigration and security, and the policies adopted are essentially aimed at sending immigrants back to their countries of origin, particularly illegal immigrants. The impression is that people only show any real interest in immigrants when they want to go home: this effectively means not recognising the freedom of those people who wish to settle and live in a country other than the one from which they originate. As you know, subsidiarity is also very important in this field, and the Member States implement policies which are their own and which vary from country to country. In France, the government's current policy is aimed at expulsion and at sending illegal immigrants home; just today, in front of the European Parliament, there is a demonstration in support of school children threatened with expulsion. This kind of policy has not been adopted in Spain or other places, and in some countries, how to react to illegal immigration is being considered. Subsidiarity is therefore much too important in this field. While co-development seems an interesting idea, I do not believe that it can replace the necessary European Union public policies, which are extremely strong, in the field of promoting the rule of law and democracy. Going beyond any difficulties we may face, that is the aim of the Union’s actions in the Democratic Republic of the Congo, which places the emphasis on public policies in the fields of health, education and the environment, but this has regrettably been jeopardised over recent years by other policies on the part of the Union and the Member States, particularly in the economic and commercial fields. We therefore need coherence and a global approach, so that we can link immigration to sustainable development issues and not treat it as simply a security issue.

Mr President, I too should like to thank Mr van den Berg for his excellent report. He is going to be showered with praise as a result, which is something at least. It is clear that the fight against corruption is absolutely crucial, in terms not only of the effectiveness of European aid, but also of its credibility. How can we really convince our fellow citizens or the Member States to give more if corruption remains endemic? This is also the condition of the viability of a constitutional State and of an economy. This is therefore a crucial battle that we must fight to the end, one that has become somewhat more complex with the advent of economic globalisation, due to the ease with which capital can be moved and also due to the new budgetary aid process at EU level. The rapporteur does a good job of highlighting all of the questions posed by this new budgetary aid system with regard to the fight against corruption, as well as the heightened problem, in the present context, resulting from the increased pressure put on raw materials and, in particular, on scarce oil supplies. There is therefore also reason to fear both a resurgence of attempts at corruption for the purposes of gaining access to the last remaining fossil fuel reserves and an increase in conflicts linked to the trade and traffic in weapons. Weapons and oil are in fact the two large sectors, in the macroeconomy, in which a high level of corruption is developing. The rapporteur therefore rightly emphasises two issues: transparency and responsibility. Transparency, in actual fact, is a crucial element if one is to have a precise and clear idea of the budgets that are used. In this field, we must be far more enthusiastic in our support of a number of initiatives, such as ‘Publish What You Pay’ or the initiative of the extractive industries, which nevertheless have the disadvantage of being based solely on voluntary participation. We need to make progress in this area of legislation rather than merely to rely on the good will of economic or political actors to publish, if they so wish, the funds or loans that they give to the governments concerned. The budgetisation of the revenue from oil and mining is also a crucial aspect of budgetary transparency but, as far as the European Union is concerned, this must be a requirement so that budgetary aid cannot be granted to a government that does not clearly publish the profits that it makes from the oil, mining or forestry industries. Public opinion cannot understand why the European Union continues helping countries that should, by rights, have a sizeable budget and one that is able to finance the smooth running of a State. Finally, the report points out that a government’s military expenditure must also be published. The role of national parliaments and of civil society simply must be strengthened, in financial terms too, by means of increased support enabling both parliaments and civil society to play their role in this area. My final point concerns transparency with regard to the various donors. The governments of these countries are also helped by towns, regions or States, at all levels, and we lack a database that would indicate what is really paid by a given country to a given State, region or town. We do not have access to that information today, and that also fuels corruption. To conclude, I therefore believe that we need to put matters in order, as has been said, and that corruption cases, too, form part of the current issues facing the European Union. The issue of exercising power and of funding political life is as relevant in the North as it is in the South.

 Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, if one has the opportunity to analyse the often transitory nature or the effectiveness of these world days devoted to some great cause or other, the conclusion is that it is an opportunity for us, on the one hand, to shed some light on a dramatic situation and on the shortage of healthcare personnel in the South, an issue to which we normally pay scant attention, and on the other hand table some proposals to implement in the short, medium or long term. Hence the need to incorporate these health objectives into the framework of the multiannual financial programming, which would make it possible to increase the predictability of EU funds, which is so lacking at present, and to give more practical support to national strategies for increasing the number of healthcare personnel. One must not forget, however, that this problem that we are discussing today is not just another stroke of bad luck due to pure chance. This shortage of healthcare personnel is in fact the result of so-called ‘structural adjustment' programmes which have been brutally pursued by the international financial institutions and which have led to the collapse of public healthcare and education services in a good many countries. There is therefore ‘a fair bit’ of hypocrisy in stating in 2006 a determination to increase healthcare personnel over the next few years, while macroeconomic financial policies pursued elsewhere have had a detrimental effect on those same human resources for over ten years. Nevertheless we welcome this awareness, however late it was in arriving, of the pressing need to invest in human resources, without which no development policy, however virtuous, can be implemented. This is why, as far as we are concerned, the EU’s action in this area should be focused on three areas. Firstly, as has already been mentioned, the amount earmarked for health issues within the framework of official development aid, which currently stands at around 5%. This is woefully inadequate, and the prospects are not all that encouraging; at least 20% is needed, not least to cover salary costs for training and for all manner of issues already mentioned. Secondly, putting an end to the budgetary restriction measures imposed by the international financial institutions. In cases such as these, the EU needs to bring its influence to bear, especially as regards the salary ceiling and civil service recruitment. Lastly, a code of ethics which would help to remedy the scandal of the two-tier recruitment, in the North, in terms of status and salary. Such recruitment, which happens in a fair number of our countries, must be combated, and the country of origin principle must be scrapped. To conclude, we trust that these generous statements of intent will actually be followed up, thanks to the very firm commitment of the EU institutions and of Parliament in particular, and thanks to the campaign started by the NGOs and European civil society.

Mr President, it is excellent that the European Union is fully involved in supporting the election process in the Democratic Republic of Congo, and we even hope that it will be more vigilant with regard to the human rights violations that have been worsening, I am afraid to say, for some time. However, the way in which the EU military operation is taking shape in the Democratic Republic of Congo today is truly strange and odd to say the least. Figures of a few hundred men have been mentioned, whereas MONUC already has 16 000 men. You say that these men would not be directly involved, but merely on hand if they were needed: where might that be, then? What would the mission of this military force be, and what mandate would these men have in the event of violence breaking out during or after the elections, especially in Kinshasa? Can lessons not be learnt from the past, when the UN forces found themselves in impossible situations and were subsequently accused from all sides because they had neither a clear mandate nor sufficient resources? There are therefore two possibilities: either the European Union thoroughly fulfils the United Nations’ request by laying down conditions and by investing substantial resources to support MONUC, or it dedicates these resources to the success of the electoral process, to the full involvement of civil society, to respect for human rights and, furthermore, to the control and transparency of the way in which the Democratic Republic of Congo’s so very precious and coveted natural resources are exploited. It is clear that, for our part, we much prefer this second prospect to one of supporting a military operation that, for the time being, is very limited, has unclear objectives and about which we have little knowledge at present.

Mr President, I, for my part – and you will see that there really is consensus on this matter – should like to stress the urgent need to break the deadlock in this situation, as the state of the resource in the Mediterranean is truly alarming. This is particularly the case with regard to bluefin tuna, but also with regard to other species, as my fellow Member pointed out. The wait-and-see policy, the standstills and the prevarications are therefore truly disastrous for the future of the Mediterranean. Moreover, we want to preserve small-scale fishing, which is so very important in the regions concerned, where it provides a livelihood for thousands of people, as has been said. Yet, it is not by exempting small-scale fishing from a number of sensible measures that we will succeed in doing this, but much rather by helping it first and foremost to adapt and by supporting it so that it can continue its activities in compliance with the regulations, which need to be those mentioned in the report. I therefore believe that we must preserve the Mediterranean: this is a crucial issue in terms of the future of fishing and it is also a major issue in terms of culture. The Council has to be fully aware of this and to be intent on breaking the deadlock in this situation as soon as possible.

Mr President, Commissioner, we already knew that there were not really any good intentions behind the trade negotiations, but it must be acknowledged that being at the Hong Kong Conference meant sitting in on a summit characterised by hypocrisy! I say this because, to be perfectly frank, the developing countries were totally cheated: practically no progress at all with regard to cotton, a sugar and banana reform that continues to be extremely problematic and catastrophic – particularly for the ACP States – and access to the market for LDCs, which, despite everything, is still not completely unrestricted and which has been delayed. The only compensation for all that comes in the form of very strong pressure aimed at liberalising services and manufactured products, something that jeopardises extremely weak economies. With regard to agriculture, therefore, one might say that, despite an apparent clash between the European Union and the United States, the policy carried out by both blocs has practically been the same, that is to say the ongoing protection of a type of agriculture. This clearly shows that the ‘lowest price’ policy does not work and that it is not viable in the long run. Little or no consideration has been given to social and environmental rules, to small-scale farming, to the peasant farmers of the South who are very threatened by the agreements, to the small farmers of the North or to the interests of small and medium-sized farms. We were therefore expecting the European Union to show a real, coherent interest in the poorest countries. We were expecting it to promote sustainable development and the harmonisation of trade rules with social and environmental rules. We did not see any of that happen and we are all the more disappointed as a result. What next, then, for the negotiations? We are very anxious about the new approach that seems to owe more to ‘top-down’ than to so-called ‘bottom up’ thinking and that marks a retreat to small group negotiations, which are less transparent and less democratic. We are particularly anxious about this matter at a time when many of our fellow citizens are deeply concerned about, and doubt, the European Union’s ability to control economic globalisation, given the way in which it is being managed at the moment.

Thank you, Commissioner, for your encouraging and highly technical comments. You are aware that development aid cannot be truly effective unless there are minimum levels of democracy and rule of law. I would like to put a supplementary question about freedom of expression and freedom of the press. We are aware of a number of events that demonstrate that there are considerable difficulties in this field, which involve journalists and a number of members of the opposition attempting to express their views. Voter lists are one thing, but freedom of expression is quite another. Could you provide us with more information about what the Commission would do in the event that abuse is observed?

I should like, Commissioner, to speak about the issue of energy and energy policies, which do not seem to me to have been dealt with in sufficient depth in your text. In fact, within the resolution on oil dependency adopted by the European Parliament during its last part-session, the need for a sustainable energy policy was emphasised as part of the EU’s policy of promoting development. There we have a particularly significant example of coherence that needs to be implemented. As you are aware, there are signs of a serious oil crisis hitting the European Union and the North in general and, at the same time, we can see that oil resources, which are so plentiful in Africa, have not benefited – to say the least - the development of the local communities. I would cite the example of Nigeria, which has the largest population and which, although one of the wealthiest African countries in terms of its resources, has not seen the development that it requires. Thus, the tensions will increase, and we require new legislative and financial instruments and a powerful EU strategy for us to succeed in managing oil in a fair and sustainable way. I should like to hear your proposals on this matter.

Mr President, for our part, we refuse to be taken in in the ways mentioned by our fellow Member. I would like first of all to emphasise a procedural issue. This debate has been hurriedly organised, following the signing of an agreement – even if it is a first phase – by the Commission. Furthermore, the Council is not here, although it is the institution that ultimately has the agreement in its hands. I believe, therefore, that we are not working in a serious fashion and that the opinion of MEPs is not being taken into consideration, as it ought to be. With regard to the content, while this agreement works in the favour of the traders and merchants who exert a great deal of pressure to get ahead, it clearly does not, in any way, serve the interests of either the producers of registered designation of origin wines or of consumers. Today, the situation is extremely confused. What you have set out, Commissioner, does not correspond to the information we have from another source. A state of deep concern is emerging on the ground. How much confidence will European consumers have in the labelling, in the labels that are in danger of being considerably undermined by this type of agreement? Furthermore, you are considerably weakening the principles that the European Union has always upheld with regard to geographical indications. What is currently taking place with regard to wine, and which is, in our view, unacceptable, is in danger of subsequently taking place with regard to a whole host of other products. For our part, we want two things to happen. On the one hand, that the Council does its job and clearly states what remit has been given to the Commission regarding this issue. On the other hand, that the European Union takes a far greater stand on ensuring that the registered designations of origin are observed, on wine-making practices and on protecting sectors that are genuinely vital to the existence of our territories and to a great number of rural territories throughout the European Union, and that it fights to protect this quality and these designated origins. Otherwise, if we embark on the WTO negotiations by giving up from the outset, I very much fear that we will lose ground time and time again in the weeks to come.

Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, more than thirty years ago the ecologist René Dumont said that Africa was in a sorry state. Today, it is again centre stage in an even more terrible state. And now you must recognise that the dogmatic liberalisation of trade, the plans for structural adjustment, the excessive privatisation and, of course, the broken promises have only served to worsen a situation that was already very difficult to the detriment of education and health policies in particular. Having said that, the essential question is for the North, for us, to answer. Are we prepared to completely revise our development model, how we produce, consume and move around, and to rethink the very organisation and meaning of our societies? What is needed now is for us to set about resolving, in the North as well as in the South, problems as fundamental as the three that I should like to list for you here. Firstly, there is the problem of access to energy, petroleum and mining resources, on which we are far too dependent and which have not helped the development of Africa. Are we ready, yes or no, to implement a completely new energy policy that is sustainable, fair and environmentally friendly? Secondly, there is the problem of access to land and to food, while respecting local rural cultures and territories. Are we ready to revise our intensive and over-industrialised agricultural policies, our unfair, subsidised trade policies, and to control the market and the price of products from the South in such a way that they are profitable? Thirdly, there is the problem of access to democracy, the rule of law and peace, at local level as well as at global level. Are we prepared to make our international bodies democratic, to support democrats in Africa, at the risk of losing a part of that excessive power that the North has over the planet, powers symbolised by the G8 who are now shut away, as if in a fortress, at Gleneagles? If we cannot clearly say yes to these three questions at least, then this great rousing media show, with the generous white knight coming to the aid of Africa, will have been, once again, no more than a sham. The European Union can no longer allow itself to disappoint. Now, for our part, we are ready to shoulder our responsibilities.

Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I should firstly like to thank Mr Casa for this very important report on the European Fisheries Fund, a sector that, unfortunately, has suffered recurrent crises due to excessive pressure on fish stocks and to the problems of organising a sustainable fish management policy which will help keep a human fabric and a dynamic business alive on our coastlines. We therefore applaud everything which helps to achieve a more selective use of fishing equipment, a reduction in environmental impact, support for small and micro fishing enterprises and transparency in the policies adopted. However, we very much deplore the fact that the Committee on Fisheries again wishes to subsidise the construction and modernisation of new boats, and indeed their export, although these subsidies were cancelled in 2002 because of their incompatibility with the aims of the policy and because of their pernicious effects. The Funds should be much more focused on human problems, such as training, technical support, redeployment, the role of women, assistance in the event of socio-economic crises, improved knowledge of environments and ways of preserving and restoring them, etc. These are the things which are vital for the future of fisheries and we hope that the Council will not give in to the temptation to satisfy certain national lobbies to the detriment of the wider interest.

Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I too am delighted that we were able to adopt this compromise. I wished to congratulate Mrs Fraga Estévez, who has accomplished a difficult and delicate, but nonetheless urgent, task in order to regulate and make provision for sustainable fishing in the Mediterranean, a sea that is itself threatened by extremely problematic developments: various types of pollution, decreasing resources, and threats to biodiversity. I am delighted at this compromise for a number of reasons. Firstly, it sets out in a particularly clear manner which fishing gear is authorised or banned; it lays down the parameters for drift nets, mesh sizes, the minimum size of fish, deep-sea trawling and so on. Equally, it ensures that European policy with regard to other seas of relevance to us, whether in the Atlantic Ocean or the North Sea, is coherent. It was essential to equip ourselves with tools and policies for managing the fishery resources in the Mediterranean. It is also a fair compromise, allowing the majority of the countries concerned to find an effective balance between what one set of countries or another has had to accept or refuse in order to reach this compromise. There remain, however, a number of issues to resolve which have in fact been raised by the previous speakers. One is the management of the entire Mediterranean basin, since we are only talking about the Member States of the European Union in this compromise. It is advisable, in fact, to strengthen the efforts of the regional organisations and to establish, within the framework of the EU Neighbourhood Policy, how we can reach agreements with the other countries bordering the Mediterranean basin. Further problems relate to bluefin tuna, which is an endangered species, or types of fishing such as purse-seine fishing, carried out for the purposes of aquaculture and involving practices that present an increasing number of problems. This compromise regulation does not directly target that type of fishing, but it is understandable how artisanal fishermen who feel themselves targeted by this regulation find it unfair that no further regulation is imposed on a developing method of fishing that creates huge problems for the preservation of ecosystems, given the means by which it is carried out. Finally, I will repeat what Members have said regarding the need for the European Union urgently to conduct a much more active research policy on the Mediterranean. However, we do not have a large amount of the information and data which would enable us to fine-tune these policies and these tools. Equally, I believe that monitoring and implementing them depend on the political will of the Member States to enforce this new regulation. That is what the debate hinges upon.

 Mr President, I am sorry to have to bring a note of discord to this fine consensus. We would have liked to support the Commission’s proposal much more proactively, and we regret that, faced with a situation as serious as the continual decline in fish stocks, albeit with slight differences between species, Member States are systematically continuing, with the assistance of a large number of MEPs, to attempt at all costs to dilute the objectives to be achieved. Even if the whole world proclaims that they support the conservation of resources, in reality it is not true, and we cannot accept this situation. That is why we will not vote for these two reports. There is no doubt that we need to hold discussions with local players and fishermen, regarding the amendment and simplification of measures that are sometimes too complicated. It is also important, of course, to take account of the socio-economic impact, to provide compensation, which must be made fair so that it does not always go to the same people, and also to preserve small-scale fisheries, which must also survive. As much as we agree with all of that, we cannot accept the systematic reduction of the Commission’s objectives, which are based on scientific data. Neither can we continually argue, in view of the situation. That is why we will vote against these two reports, whilst supporting the Commission’s intentions in this field.

 Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, when we talk about organic farming there is a real paradox. Everyone – including you, Commissioner, and the European Commission as a whole – recognises the undeniable benefits of organic farming, in terms of the environment, biodiversity and health, but also in terms of employment and rural development. However, despite a growing demand on the part of consumers for products originating from organic farming, the organically farmed areas and organic production are not increasing, and still represent a very marginal share of overall production of agricultural products. It was with great astonishment that we learned of the Commission’s action plan in favour of organic farming, which we had been hoping would be particularly ambitious and accompanied by the appropriate resources. This is not how it has turned out, however, even though we note, with evident satisfaction, some welcome proposals, such as the public awareness and information campaigns, or the emphasis placed on public canteens and school meals in particular. Moreover, when it comes to organic products we could make a start with the catering facilities at the European Parliament itself. You do not identify any specific resources, i.e. additional resources, and nor are there any proactive – let alone mandatory – measures with regard to Member States, even though the need to harmonise the different policies of Member States on organic farming would appear to be obvious to everybody if we really want to contribute to the development of organic farming and reduce the disparities that exist. Nor do we find any progress on the nonetheless crucial question of genetically modified organisms, the coexistence of conventional crops alongside organic crops, or the issue of liability in cases of contamination. We are waiting for your proposals on these matters, without which Member States will finally be left entirely to their own devices on issues which are, after all, essential to organic farming. This is why the Members of the European Parliament wanted to see a much firmer commitment to organic farming, much firmer than information campaigns which, useful though they may be, seem to us to be an inadequate response to the issues at stake. Consequently, we believe that major investments need to be made, in particular to make the specifications for different products in different Member States more consistent and more precise, and to make better use of rural development funds by defining much more clearly the share which is assigned to organic farming. We hope that the FEADER programme, which is devoted to rural development, will make it possible to reply to these questions. These rural development funds also need to be strengthened. There are substantial threats hanging over these funds, and we cannot accept the plans to reduce the European Union’s overall budget, which would be likely to damage them badly. We would also like to make organic farming the subject of priority research within the framework of the European research programmes. We want increased aid to be granted to the economic structuring of the organic sector, from production and processing to distribution and marketing. Unless this sector is strengthened, we shall not achieve any real progress. It is also necessary to settle the issue of genetically modified organisms, and to improve significantly the inspection and fraud control systems in this area. All this must be done in collaboration with the people involved in the sector, the producer associations, consumers, cooperatives and all those who have been committed, for many years, to organic farming, unfortunately without much support. The European Parliament must also be fully associated with these policies, and I would draw your attention to the fact that any amendment to the regulation on organic farming should also be the subject of consultations with the Members of the European Parliament. Finally, we really must move away from the idea of a ‘niche’ as far as organic farming is concerned. It is not a small, separate sector destined for a sympathetic clientele which is well motivated with regard to environmental issues, and with a high disposable income which will enable it to have access to this type of food. On the contrary, we believe that organic farming can be the spearhead of a truly sustainable agricultural industry. As part of any future reforms of the common agricultural policy, which are, as we all know, inevitable, we believe that organic farming can serve as a model. Obviously, it is not a model that is 100% reproducible everywhere, but we believe that this type of farming, the merits and benefits of which are recognised by everyone, should be strongly supported and encouraged so that it can achieve much higher percentages of overall agricultural production. We are therefore counting on action on the part of the Members of the European Parliament, and we hope that the Commission will listen to this desire to declare support for organic farming in much stronger terms.

Mr President, when we talk about hunger, we are also talking, and this seems to me to be obvious, about agricultural policy. So we cannot, on the one hand, discuss the possibility of increasing development aid funds and, on the other hand, pursue agricultural policies that contribute to a worsening of the situation in many countries. As an example, the EU is currently negotiating Economic Partnership Agreements with the ACP (Africa, Caribbean and Pacific) countries that are causing a great deal of concern, or even opposition, with regard to the direction now being taken. This is because the discussions are concentrating almost exclusively on an indiscriminate liberalisation of trade, without taking account of local conditions, while large numbers of cheap, often subsidised, exports from our countries are already playing a part in seriously destabilising the situation for farmers in these countries. I therefore think that all these issues need to be examined at the meeting of the ACP-EU Joint Assembly which will take place in Bamako in April. I hope, on behalf of my group, that the direction taken by the European Union in this area will change so as to achieve greater consistency between what we are saying today about hunger and poverty and what we are saying elsewhere, in other arenas, about agricultural policy and the liberalisation of trade in agricultural products. This is a truly fundamental question. If we can start now by making sure our deeds reflect our words, I think we will have taken a real step forward.

Mr President, it goes without saying that I agree with practically nothing the previous Member said and, like many Members of this House, I attended the World Social Forum in Porto Alegre. At this point, it is not a question of competing to see who is in the best position to combat poverty, but of seeing things as they are. On the one hand, the World Social Forum was an enormous success this year – 155 000 participants, 135 countries; that is considerable – and it has taken on a new tone since, on a certain number of issues – social, environmental, economic, financial – many networks have continued to be put in place and have done extremely serious work, in an extremely concrete manner, in order, specifically, to produce a number of proposals which have yet to be developed, but which are very real. On the other hand, the World Social Forum does not just consist of NGOs, it also includes parliamentarians – the Parliamentarians’ Forum – and local elected representatives, of which there were also many this year, who have discussed district and local authority policies in response to the challenges we are facing. Very dynamic, enthusiastic and hard-working young people are also extremely well represented, and I do not believe we can casually sweep aside such dynamism and vitality. In reality, the World Social Forum has two aims. Firstly, to explain that free trade cannot provide a response to the increasing social inequalities. They are not increasing because of a scourge which has merely come out of the blue, but rather because the policies being implemented over recent years in the fields of structural adjustment and of reducing public spending have led to increasing inequalities and poverty and to increased deterioration of the environment and of the planet as a whole. The second aim is to propose an alternative to the current development model and reject the presentation of world free trade as a panacea and a miracle cure for everything. It is clearly not these things. All the bodies of the United Nations indicate that the situation is deteriorating today. Finally, whether we are talking about Porto Alegre or Davos, what we need is practical action. We must no longer be content with words, images and positions adopted. We need very practical and precise commitments, a work plan. Mr President of the Commission, that is something else we expect from you who are, together with the Commission – and with us all – in a position to take decisions: not just good intentions or Millennium objectives, but also extremely specific proposals.

 Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, for us, cancelling the poorest countries’ debts is, indeed, an absolute necessity if we wish seriously to tackle North-South inequalities and maldevelopment as much as underdevelopment. It must nonetheless go hand in hand with the more vigorous combating of corruption, tax havens and globalised financial crime. Nor can it involve absolving all those, including leaders of states, who have scandalously feathered their own nests out of disregard for their people and for sound budgetary management at even the most basic level. Cancelling the debt would also constitute a first stage in reforming our development aid policy in depth. A reconsidered policy of North-South cooperation should thus be based upon much more ambitious objectives, particularly regarding matters relating to energy, water, health and education, and should affirm and clarify the notion of the global public good. We urgently need a very strong commitment by the EU in this connection, accompanied by clarified objectives and backed by much greater resources – a plan equal in scope to the post-war Marshall Plan, but with a determinedly European name and structure.

 Mr President, I should like to raise two points regarding the tragic situation in certain developing countries. Firstly, our attention should not solely be focused on the important question of medicine or some future vaccine. It should also be focused on restoring or setting up proximity-based health services, in other words those located as close as possible to communities. Those services have, unfortunately, been badly affected in recent years by structural adjustment plans undertaken in those countries, especially in Africa. We must also offer all our support to local initiatives launched by civil society and to networks, on the ground, of local representatives and authorities, associations, carers and mediators from the societies in question, who have been working together to combat AIDS, with some success. Secondly, the growing rate of infection among women is not simply down to their fragile nature or to bad luck. It is also the result of violence of all kinds – particularly sexual – against women in various regions of the world, and of the blatant discrimination to which they are subjected. Such violence has nothing to do with cultural characteristics, which is the erroneous explanation that is sometimes given. It must be referred to by name and combated as such. These two aspects show, therefore, that AIDS is as much a social problem as it is a medical problem. Let us not forget that.

 Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I wish firstly, on behalf of the Group of the Greens/European Free Alliance, to express my delight in the decisions taken by the Security Council this week, particularly concerning the arms embargo, on condition however that this embargo is genuinely respected and that arms sales can be controlled much more effectively, as is also emphasised in the report presented by our colleague, Mr Romeva i Rueda. If, however, it is indeed a question of reacting firmly to the violence being committed in Côte d'Ivoire, we also have to take much longer-term action, and not only when the situation becomes untenable. That is why we think we need far-reaching reforms not only of France’s, but also of the European Union’s, policies on Africa. The reforms should relate, in particular, to issues of sustainable economic development in the foreign policy we conduct with regard to these countries. In the case of Côte d'Ivoire, it must, even so, be emphasised that the falls in the cost of raw materials and of cocoa have plunged a large portion of the population into extreme poverty, which is helping to destabilise the country still more. The European Union has also very recently renewed its fishing agreement with Côte d'Ivoire, which poses huge problems at a time when Côte d'Ivoire is in a state of civil war and there is no means of monitoring these fishing agreements. There are also the structural adjustment policies which have hugely destabilised the education and health systems and the public services. In short, all these policies – economic, commercial and financial – also play a considerable role in the political situation in these countries, a fact that obviously does not in any way detract from the responsibility of the African and Côte d'Ivoire politicians themselves. We most certainly need, however, to take long-term action to link these policies. Indeed, we cannot, on the one hand, advocate the development of armed forces in the North – albeit in the good cause of disarming forces to whom, incidentally, we have previously sold arms – and, on the other hand, help thrust whole populations into extreme poverty by means of inequitable and destructive financial and commercial policies, thereby making it that much more difficult to establish a democratic state governed by the rule of law. We therefore want to see the European Union steer a totally different course regarding Côte d'Ivoire and all the African countries so that all these aspects might be reconciled and so that we are not content merely to react – react though we must – to extremely difficult crises.

 Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I should like to draw your attention, on behalf of the Group of the Greens/European Free Alliance, to the importance of the common agricultural policy and of the role of the Commissioner assigned to the agriculture portfolio. The CAP, to which the European Union still devotes almost half of its budget, does indeed loom large for the EU. What, moreover, is at stake is the future of our rural areas, our food, our health and our relations with developing countries, as well as making a success of enlargement. In fact, the position of the majority of farmers is now very difficult, and this in spite of a food-processing industry that, in itself, is flourishing. What with the disappearance of small to medium-sized farms due to the persistent injustices linked to subsidies; trade wars that have little to do with the fair competition otherwise enjoined upon us; the deterioration of the environment, including our soil and water; and ever more standardised and artificial food, the CAP has, in our view, a very great deal to answer for. The reform adopted in 2003, which is still very liberal in its inspiration, does not, unfortunately, enable these problems to be treated satisfactorily, and your answers on the subject have been particularly feeble and evasive. We would therefore ask you right now to take a very serious look at these issues. We cannot approve a Commission that comes up with such feeble answers in this area.

 Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, we naturally share Parliament’s stated desire to come to the aid of the civilian communities of Darfur and to put an end to a civil war that has been appalling from both a humanitarian as well as a political perspective, and to do so, as has already been mentioned, with the support, for example, of the African Union’s initiatives. While it is useful and essential, however, to be a good fire-fighter, I feel that it is even more essential for us not to lapse into starting fires of our own. I should therefore like to address the subject of access to oil resources, which is becoming increasingly difficult and beset by conflict. It is an issue that has, to terrible effect, been fanning the flames of the situation in Darfur for a number of years. It is a familiar scenario: tensions and wars intensify as access to oil resources becomes a source of conflict and a major issue both for a number of international powers and for the local powers. Not only are the USA and Europe – particularly France, which has a major influence in the region – implicated in this situation, but so are China and a number of Asian countries. We are also all aware of the scandal of the misuse of oil revenue, which often serves only to fuel the personal enrichment, corruption and arms purchases that we see today, not to mention the worsening breaches of the human rights of the communities affected, all of this against a backdrop of successive dictatorships that are, in turn, sometimes supported more or less openly by the same people who are today expressing outrage at the situation. Faced with this situation, I feel that the EU has major responsibilities and is duty bound, at world level and thus within the UN, to launch an entirely different energy policy, one that is fair, sustainable and genuinely intended to serve the citizens, and to do so with the help of politicians, oil companies and civil society. We must also step up the fight against financial crime and against tax havens; we must block the financial accounts and the profits of dictators and profiteers of all kinds. We must, of course, offer our solid support for alternative energy policies both at home and in countries such as these, and Europe must also be much more demanding and much more vigilant as regards the support offered by the major providers of international funds to certain oil projects, such as the Chad-Cameroon oil pipeline. We must support civil society and the democrats in these countries and, in short, must be able to act diplomatically, politically and economically in a coherent fashion. I feel that this could constitute an essential and even priority task for the future representative of a strong common foreign policy – a policy that we all wish very much to see.

 Mr President, I am in fact glad that this debate is taking place, because we have been trying to put it on the agenda for several sittings. So today, not long before the end of this mandate, we would really like to stress that Sierra Leone, one of the poorest countries in the world, which has really succeeded in establishing this Special Court to try those responsible for the atrocities, should be supported. Having been the head of the European Union Election Observation Mission in Sierra Leone, I really believe that it is our political and moral responsibility to support this court, because it would be truly unacceptable and unimaginable for this court to be unable to continue its work for what are potentially financial reasons. I therefore urge the Commission to support it, financially, of course. Moreover, at the time the judges of these courts asked us to provide financial support to help keep this Special Court going. However, now it is at political level, because it is coming to an end in 2010. We must… (The President cut off the speaker)

Mr President, I would like also to thank the rapporteur for accepting our amendments and putting the issue of human rights at the centre of negotiations with Russia. I would ask the Council and the Commission not to give way in this area, just as I would ask the rapporteur to support our other amendments on respect for the rights of minorities and of Chechnya, which have been somewhat forgotten in the report. We also support the critical attitude towards Russia because, even if Russia is now giving some positive signals, notably with regard to its willingness to conclude an international agreement on the reduction of nuclear arsenals, which are no doubt too costly in this time of crisis, it still remains completely uncompromising on other issues, particularly regarding its neighbourhood policy, reproaching the European Union for interfering in its sphere of influence. I would remind you that recently in Brussels Mr Lavrov criticised the Eastern partnership that we set up at the spring summit, just as Mr Putin reacted negatively to the gas agreement between the European Union and Ukraine. As you know – and as everyone has stated – the issue of Georgia remains more topical than ever and still remains a bone of contention between us and Russia, which constantly uses its right of veto to prevent any deployment of international peacekeeping forces and even access for our civilian observers to the territories that it occupies and controls. It is therefore in breach of the six points of the agreement that the EU concluded with Russia on 12 August, and fails to stop the daily acts of violence along the Abkhazia-Ossetia administrative border. Furthermore, no one is fooled by the Member States’ dependence, as has been mentioned, on Russia for energy or by the political price that we have to pay. Finally, Mr President, faced with a global crisis that spares no one, including Russia, I would like unexpected solutions to emerge and to predispose Russia to accept a constructive partnership, and the EU to carry more weight as a united partner.

Mr President, Commissioner, I would simply like to remind you that it was the polar bears on the ice floes who showed us how much chemical pollution was affecting the whole of the world. DDT was found in their fat, and we all know very well that that is not a substance that is used on the ice floes. In any case, I would like to thank the Commission for the proposal it made after the discussion we had here in Parliament, because it is really urgent, on account of climate change, to protect the only area that is sheltered from human predation. We must remember that. There is, of course – and here I am taking up what Mrs De Keyser said – political urgency, because, after all, we are forced to do something for the Arctic. Indeed, some of the owners of part of this continent have designs on it. We know very well that Russia, which we spoke about recently, wants to establish its frontiers beyond its maritime area and extend them over the continental shelf. It is therefore an urgent matter for us, because Russia also wants to place its flags there and install military units, just as Canada does. What is missing from your proposal, perhaps, is what we asked for last time, that is, an international treaty for the protection of the Arctic, which will allow us to ensure its protection once and for all.

Mr President, Minister, Commissioner, I think that we need to stop being hypocritical regarding this issue. In 2006 I myself was part of a European Parliament delegation that travelled to Turkmenistan, and we made a number of proposals at that time which you have taken up, Commissioner. Clearly, I understand your arguments and those of the Council, but when I compare what has been proposed and the report on Central Asia – which we voted in favour of in this very House a few months ago, on 20 February 2008 and in which we repeated our demands concerning the release of prisoners, the Red Cross, and so on – has there really been any progress? No. Personally, when I read ‘Turkmenistan report’, I actually read ‘Nabucco report’ because, at the end of the day, we are interested in the energy, in the gas of this third biggest gas-producing country in the world. Furthermore, I know – it was explained to us very well when we were in Turkmenistan – that, were the European Union not interested in Turkmen gas, then the country had other customers, not least China. So let us avoid being hypocritical, let us make it plain … (The President cut off the speaker)

Mr President, Mr Kohout, Mrs Ashton, I have listened to what you have said. Mr Kohout, you spoke about economic sustainability. The question I am asking myself today is what that means, apart from words. Indeed, what does that mean at a time of economic, financial and environmental crisis? What guarantees can we give? Despite the reassuring words of the Commissioner, I am asking whether, since these agreements were discussed in another world, is the project we are proposing to our African, Caribbean and Pacific partners actually still appropriate in the current situation? Personally, I do not think so. We meet with NGOs, we meet with SMEs. We were in Guyana recently where the president said to us: you are asking us to diversify, but tell us what goods can our small country produce that can compete with Brazil or Venezuela? Today, therefore, I think that we must not close our eyes. You speak on the one hand about flexibility and on the other about WTO rules. I am sorry but the two terms are absolutely contradictory, because they would require restructuring and we know very well that restructuring causes greater poverty in these countries. I do not think, therefore, that what we are proposing today and what we proposed in the past are at all appropriate. Have we looked at the results of the development model that we have set up over the last 40 years? It is a failure and I think that has been said already. This failure then, I think, will now continue; the situation will get worse with these partnership agreements because they are absolutely not appropriate to the global economic, social and environmental situation.

 Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, I would still like to remind you that we have not managed to settle the frozen conflicts in these eastern regions, nor have we managed to avoid war between Russia and Georgia. I believe in fact that this Eastern Partnership is welcome because there is a need, in the first place, to stabilise these regions and to avoid falling into the trap of the area of influence because there is us, there is the United States, there is Russia and there is Turkey. I also believe that we have to ask ourselves, in the context of this partnership, if there is not a need to introduce a neutral buffer zone, in other words states which would have neutral status to avoid the friction which we are witnessing today with Georgia and the Ukraine seeking NATO membership. We know perfectly well the effect of this membership on Russia. We are looking for stability and energy security from this Eastern Partnership. We must ensure this security because, as one of the Members said, energy from the Caspian Sea travels through the Caucasus; so we must have stability in the Caucasus. I also believe that our fellow citizens should get to know these regions and, for this, I believe that the Commission must invest in some projects. The problem showed itself in fact when the new countries gained accession. I think then that we must introduce projects to make these regions known and to ensure that they have a European perspective.

Madam President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, the Group of the Greens/European Free Alliance strongly condemns the assassination of the President of Guinea-Bissau, João Bernardo Vieira, and the head of the armed forces, General Tagme Na Waie, on 1 and 2 March 2009. We demand that a full investigation be carried out and that the perpetrators be prosecuted, and similarly for the killers of Generals Mané and Correia, killed in 2000 and 2004, who remain unidentified to this day. As one of the poorest of the poor and noted for its low life expectancy, Guinea-Bissau is today faced with drug trafficking. As a bridgehead for the South American drug smugglers, Guinea-Bissau has become a country of transit for drugs which are destined for Europe, where we represent the biggest consumer. We also know only too well that this is affecting the entire sub-region as, in Mauritania, for example, large quantities of drugs have been discovered, even at the airport. The European Union must help this country to turn its back on this trade by fighting it both here and there and by a return to development based on that country’s own resources. While the last elections were welcomed by the international community and the European Union has shown its support for the process of learning about and installing democracy in Guinea-Bissau, the events this country has just lived through can only reinforce this position of aid and assistance. The army too, which did not intervene in the electoral process, must also continue with its strict observation of the constitutional order, as it has promised. While the neighbouring West African countries have, after years of problems and chaos, rediscovered the road to democracy, respect for the institutions and human rights, Guinea-Bissau must not fall into the trap of reprehensible practices. The European Union must be present and use its influence and its example to help this country to stay on the road to democracy.

Madam President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, I would like to say very quickly that we deplore all the horrors of Darfur and that we all demand that everything be done to ensure that the associations and NGOs, who have a crucial role to play in these cases, can continue their work and are not expelled. I would, however, like to put a question to the Commissioner. I would like to know what you are expecting, what the European Union is expecting, of the African Union. We have heard one Member demand armed intervention. In our resolution, we call on the Commission and the Council to intensify the efforts to influence the government via the African Union. In other countries, we delegate the resolution of conflicts to the African Union. We are aware of the African Union’s position on the al-Bashir case. It appears that there are double standards here. What strategy, then, will the Commission adopt in relation to the African Union, as we are talking about the African continent? Is it the case that here, too, we want to delegate the work and the resolution of this conflict to the African Union?

Madam President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, I think that, together in this House, we have been repeating the same things for years. I think everything has already been said about water, about this shared resource of mankind, and, unfortunately, it has to be said again because the situation is far from improving, rather the opposite. The latest United Nations report shows that, in fact, the situation seems to be getting worse. I therefore think that, despite the proposals that have been made and the policies that have been conducted by the European Union, which are a first step forward, we really need to go further than that because, without water, there is no life. We must also be aware that many populations, particularly countries we trade with and have dialogue with, have had their water supplies cut off or still do not have access to drinking water. This is absolutely inadmissible and unacceptable. In my opinion, we really must support – and I think that the European Union must provide support at international level and at Istanbul – the status of water as a shared resource of mankind. It is not a commodity which can be sold or which could be sold by our multinational companies. That is really what we must fight for at Istanbul, and I think that our fellow Members will fight for it.

Madam President, I did not really want to speak on this report, but just to add a point that is particularly close to my heart and which I have raised on several occasions at the ACP meetings. It is the issue of health conditions for the Tuareg people in Niger. In this context, Commissioner, I should really like to raise the problem of European companies that exploit natural resources in African countries and, in particular, the French company, Areva, which is going to exploit uranium in Niger, without giving any information to the local communities, with the result that the people living there are using, for example, radioactive materials or scrap metal for cooking utensils. Today, the authorities in Niger are not allowing serious studies to be carried out on the situation regarding radioactivity among these people, but we know that they are in an alarming situation. We had asked, during one ACP meeting, for an epidemiological study to be carried out on these people. I am putting this request again today to the Commission.

Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, I would like first of all to thank the Chairman of the Committee on Foreign Affairs for agreeing to accept the procedure laid down in Article 91 and to put this emergency resolution on last Monday’s agenda, since, at our last plenary here, in Strasbourg, we already had an emergency resolution on this issue of Sri Lanka. I would also like to thank Parliament for having agreed to this debate taking place this evening, and I thank you, Commissioner, for coming to this debate, as I know the time is difficult for you. We wanted this resolution because we have to send a strong political signal to the government and the Tamil representatives in Sri Lanka, because the situation is getting worse every day. We have first hand accounts from Tamil families and people who are in Europe and who are always sending us messages and accounts of what is happening to them and what is happening to their families trapped in the conflict between the Tamil Tigers and the Sri Lankan army. These people are enduring really terrible suffering. We do not know how many people are affected, but we estimate that between 150 and 200 000 people need to be evacuated. What is meant by ‘evacuated’, though? The NGOs are asking us to have them evacuated by sea, but, there again, I have to ask: to go where? Where are these people going to go? This afternoon, I met a little girl who was born in a Sri Lankan refugee camp and who is now in Europe. If it is that these people have to leave their country to go and live in refugee camps, then that is not the solution, either. Therefore, we are asking in this resolution for there to be an actual ceasefire. Of course, there will be debate with the Group of the European People’s Party (Christian Democrats) and European Democrats about an immediate or temporary ceasefire. We are really asking the authorities for an immediate ceasefire so that civilians can be removed from danger, because we know that there are people who have been killed. We have had another example of this today with these testimonies. We are asking, of course, in this resolution, for the Sri Lankan Government to cooperate with the NGOs and with countries that are willing to help to resolve this conflict. We are also asking if the European Union can help to deliver desperately needed food and medicines. Finally, may I say on behalf of my group – since it is on the initiative of the Group of the Greens/European Free Alliance that we tabled this emergency resolution on Monday in the Committee on Foreign Affairs – that we are asking for this issue to be taken very seriously by some of our fellow Members, who have different interests in this country. I would remind you that, for a long time now, some of the political groups have been asking for the opportunity to speak about the situation in Sri Lanka and that, for internal reasons in some countries, we have not been able to debate this issue of the Tamils and their situation, which has deteriorated since the 1980s. Since you are here with us, Commissioner, maybe we can ask ourselves another question. The European Union appears to have the ability to help in resolving conflict. Perhaps the time has come for us to consider the possibility of setting up a conflict resolution unit within the European Union. We can see in the Caucasus, we can see everywhere else in the world that the European Union is taken seriously for the proposals that it issues. In resolving conflict today, we must no longer be just a supportive participant, but an actual promoter of conflict resolution. If, today, we can start to lay the foundations to resolve this conflict with a strong European Union presence and a strong message to the authorities, I believe that we will have also increased our stature in terms of political union.

Mr President, I wish to thank Mrs Ferrero-Waldner for her speech and for her response to the call from the NGOs and the people who are trapped. We are afraid of finding ourselves in a somewhat similar situation to Burma after the tsunami in 2006, where the junta prevented access to humanitarian aid. Now, therefore, we must do everything possible so that humanitarian aid and our aid reaches the people who need it. I should also like, however, to speak to my fellow Members from the Group of the European People’s Party (Christian Democrats) and European Democrats and the Socialist Group in the European Parliament, because I believe, ladies and gentlemen, that we must appeal to wisdom. Indeed, we submitted this proposal for an emergency resolution in order to allow Parliament to express an opinion and adopt a position tomorrow. What I would not want, under any circumstances, is for one side or the other not to vote for this resolution because of differences of opinion about an immediate ceasefire or a temporary ceasefire, which we understand because the debate has already taken place. I therefore genuinely call upon you, please, to act wisely. On the other hand, I should like to say, particularly to Mr Tannock, that, to repeat the words of Mrs Ferrero-Waldner: armed conflict never solved any problem. We know that. War never resolves anything. In my opinion, asking for a temporary ceasefire is irresponsible with regard to the people concerned. That would mean, in fact, putting them back into battle at some future time – and what a future that would be – once the people had been evacuated. Can we allow ourselves to leave people to be evacuated? Tamil people are people who own land. Therefore, they want to return to their land. They are Sri Lankan. I therefore believe that we have to pay close attention to this matter, but I am prepared to make concessions and to withdraw amendments provided that, together, we can reach a common position so as to send out this strong political signal to the entire world.

 Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, when the Erika
 was shipwrecked, I was one of those Members in France who called on the French authorities to close the sluices so that the salt pans would not be polluted. When the Prestige
 disaster occurred, I was co-rapporteur, along with Mr Sterckx, as we were jointly responsible for the topic of transport – I myself was responsible for the environment – and we quite justifiably called for greater safety in maritime transport. I well remember how hard we fought in this very Parliament for an inquiry committee on the Prestige
 to be set up: it certainly made an impression. Today, therefore, I think we can all be pleased with the fact that many international and European rules have moved forward as part of the maritime package, and I hope this will soon be nothing more than a bad memory. However, I would like, if I may, to draw attention to… (The President cut off the speaker)

Madam President, I would like to quote the example of Georgia to show you how far we are from our stated ambition for the Common Foreign and Security Policy, despite the efforts of our High Representative and Commissioner Ferrero-Waldner. Now, of course, Mr Solana, you are asking for more capabilities and more aid. For my part, I would ask you the following question: is the European Union currently able to meet its commitments, particularly in relation to the ceasefire agreement that we have proposed with Russia? Obviously I understand Commissioner. We know to what extent the European Union has been present and how it intervened quickly, but today we must also be aware that the Georgians are confronted by the Russian army, based on the territory of Abkhazia and South Ossetia. I am certainly not questioning the remarkable work of the civilian observer mission on the ground. However, what can our observers do to defend civilians against the daily violence? Not much, apart from act as witnesses. Moreover, the ambition of the CFSP, in this case in Georgia, will be judged against our courage finally to send peacekeeping forces to stabilise a region that we have included in our neighbourhood policy.

 Mr President, Minister, Commissioner, I would also like to thank Mrs Napoletano since, during the first discussion on the Union for the Mediterranean, I was rather sceptical and whilst this may still be the case, I now believe that there is hope. The challenges are absolutely enormous. Do we have the resources to confront them? We know that we do not. The objectives are certainly noble: environment, energy, the fight against desertification, immigration, etc. We must not, however, just descend into a disconnected list that would only lead to disappointments on the other side of the Mediterranean. However, if you would allow me, Commissioner, I would like to mention a particular country that is not a Mediterranean coastal state but has been included; it is an ACP country and also a member of the Union for the Mediterranean. This country, Mauritania, is today going through a very serious political crisis. I think that, as a partner in the Union for the Mediterranean, as an ACP country and in the name of the neighbourhood policy, this country deserves our support to help it get out of this crisis. I believe that this is what the two parties to the conflict are asking us to do and we have a responsibility to commit ourselves to help it out of this major political crisis.

Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, what do we know and what do we see in relation to Sri Lanka? What reports do we have to go on when all the NGOs, except the Red Cross, have been evacuated from the country since September? Who should we believe? The Sri Lankan Government or anonymous witnesses? One thing is certain: the situation is developing into a final assault, into a kill for a government set on using force to put a stop to a rebellion that has lasted too long for its liking. Once again, who is picking up the pieces, ladies and gentlemen? All the civilians, women, children, the elderly, of course, who are stuck in the middle and suffering unbearable violence. This has to stop. It is high time the international community really put pressure on the Sri Lankan Government so that it stops this escalation of violence and killing. The European Union must adopt a very clear position and not make the Tamil civilians the people history overlooked and the martyrs of indifference. Our European Parliament must not stop at this joint resolution. We must demand an immediate and unconditional cease-fire, which will mark the beginning of a stronger commitment in favour of a peaceful end to this conflict, with respect shown for human rights and cultural identities.

Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, we can congratulate ourselves on the broad consensus here, but we nevertheless remain in isolation: Commissioner for the Environment, Ministers for the Environment, how important is the environment for the Commission and for the Councils and governments? We know how important. I myself was not at all in favour of setting up this committee because I think that nothing is better at isolating something than creating a new committee. In France, we speak of a ‘Théodule committee'. I wonder about the future of this report from the point of view of its integration into European policies. I would just like to remind those Members who were there in 1992 that there was an excellent report on sustainable development. No sooner had it been adopted – what is more, unanimously – this excellent report was buried completely. Perhaps if we had introduced it into European policies, we would not be here now. I would like to speak to the rapporteur, who denies that he is presenting a political project. Mr Florenz, it is a political project you are presenting, because it is a complete reorientation of European policies, in terms of agriculture, fishing and transport. So, yes, we must be more ambitious and we await the results.

 The report again suggests the nuclear option, even though this energy is not competitive and uranium is obtained in dangerous conditions that give rise to ethnic discrimination and have an unacceptable impact on health. Due to the issue of global warming, coal cannot be considered a ‘transitional component’. I believe that the ‘diversification of EU energy resources’ is linked to the exploitation of fossil resources in the Caspian Sea. The gas and oil fields of the Kashagan region are putting pressure on the populations and their environmental resources: the extraction of oil rich in sulphides threatens the health of the populations and biodiversity. The diversification of energy supplies assumes that there are gas and oil pipelines to transport resources to the EU. The TBC and Nabucco projects are affecting the political stability of our neighbours. We have an obligation not to allow our energy needs to threaten their stability. The populations of the Southern Caucasus must receive an economic and social benefit from the extraction of energy from their territories. In Africa, the production of solar energy destined to meet our needs has to be suitably rewarded. Why not say in the report that renewable energies and energy saving are the answer in the future? As it stands currently, I am voting against this report.

 Mr President, we have all fought for the closure of Guantánamo and we all welcome President Obama’s decision to close this prison of shame. Now, we should not have to be asked about accepting Guantánamo detainees. As Europeans, faithful to the values of defending human rights, we have to face up to our responsibilities, our duty to accept these ex-detainees. There have been reports, and I am addressing the Council here, there have been reports in the press that some Member States are not keen on receiving them. I would therefore call on the Council and, in particular, on any reticent Member States, to accept the arrival of these detainees on their territories. I would also say to you, ladies and gentlemen, that the worst we could do would be to let the boost given by the closure of Guantánamo evaporate because Europe was not prepared to stand up and be counted.

 Mr President, Europe has been a pioneer before, and it wants to continue to act as a bridgehead in Copenhagen. Of course the world is watching, observing us today, but its gaze is also focused on the Obama Administration. And we are right to wonder whether he is doing a better job, since we are still falling short in this area. We are falling short when it comes to polluters and, ultimately, leaving negotiation of the energy and climate change package to the Member States. Personally, I have lost all faith. We have been sounding the alarm to no avail for a long time. Across the Atlantic, the world’s largest emitter has announced that, by 2020, it will cut emissions back to 1990 levels, in other words, a 60% reduction in its emissions. Furthermore, it wants directly to auction 100% of the allowances. I ask you: where is the fault in this? Of course, we pat ourselves on the back for our considerable efforts, even though we know for a fact that we fall far short of what the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change scientists are demanding. In the US, trade unions have backed the transformation to a low-carbon economy. This really should inspire our manufacturers, who are preoccupied with using the environmental, financial and economic crises to make staff redundant, after years of making profits that were not redistributed to employees and after years of negotiating voluntary agreements on pollution, which were just as much of a failure.

 Madam President, having paid to save the banks, we now have to save the automobile industry and once again, of course, with public funds. For more than ten years, however, we have been alerting the automobile industry of the consequences of CO2
 emissions on public health. For more than ten years, we have been calling for the industry to build clean cars. For more than ten years, it has turned a deaf ear and has resisted with the powerful automobile lobby. It has been holding back any development. Recently, Commissioner, and you are in a position to know this, in this Parliament it opposed ‘CARS 21’ in order not to reduce emissions below 130 grams. Yet, after making considerable profits, which were not reinvested in industrial restructuring, the financial crisis has become a good excuse to ask for public aid and sack workers left, right and centre. Are consumers going to be fooled yet again? In fact, consumers are going to have to pay so that they can obtain a clean car on the market, with no guarantee that it will be cheaper, just as in the present situation. It is therefore elsewhere that the automobile industry must be steered to avoid future bankruptcies because we must prepare for the post-car era.

Madam President, I shall address myself to the Commission because the representative of the Council is no longer here. I truly believe that Mr Barroso’s proposals will not resolve the current crisis, because he has forgotten one factor, namely the causes of this crisis. These are our production-driven system and our concept of development, which destroy and exploit the planet and its people. The crisis is not over; I believe we must be aware of that. Indeed, I think it is only beginning; our society has been sent reeling, and there is far more to come. As I see it, while the leaders of this world, with its globalised economy, are failing to recognise the need to change course, our fellow citizens, for their part, are unable to understand how billions of euros can be found to bail out banks today and the motor industry tomorrow at a time when the content of housewives’ shopping baskets is being steadily whittled away. You propose economic recovery measures, but if it is the same thing that has been tried over these past years and has led to chaos, you are on the wrong track. I believe we really must reduce our ecological footprint. That is the issue. How do you intend to resolve it? (The President cut off the speaker)

 Madam President, Mr Jouyet, I was in Tbilisi when the president came to negotiate the peace plan, and I should of course like to pay tribute to him for his rapid action to put a stop to this war. However, the war was partly our own failure: for 14 years, we have been overcautious; we have looked on in silence as the provocations in the separatist regions escalated. It is true that this war was a wake-up call for Europe, confronting it with its responsibilities, but the fire is still smouldering in the Caucasus, and we must do everything we can to bring a definitive end to the frozen conflicts, in the interests of the security of the whole of Europe. I also know, Mr Jouyet, that the countries of Europe are divided with respect to Georgia’s entry into NATO; myself, I am against it. I will make you a proposal: I call on the European Union to propose neutrality for these countries in the Caucasus. Only neutrality will calm tensions with Russia and definitively protect this subregion from new conflicts. Neutrality will guarantee the security of these new democracies, and will help to ensure our own security.

 Mr President, a question first of all to the Council. What about the High-Level Conference on Georgia proposed by the French Presidency, and how the current EU Presidency plans to defend the territorial integrity of Georgia, when two separatist regions, Abkhazia and South Ossetia, are recognized by another country? It is a shame that Mr Barroso is not here, because his speech lacked conviction. Perhaps because he himself is not convinced by his own proposals. I believe that the financial and economic situation is much more serious than he described. Even today, I think anyone on the internet can clearly see that stock markets are continuing to collapse, despite all the intervention. I see this as a real meltdown of the current system, a system which is completely obsolete, a system which has led to bankruptcy, which has led to the land being completely exploited and suffocated by greenhouse gas emissions, which has led to underdevelopment in the South, and underdevelopment in our towns and cities.

 Mr President, Commissioner, I would also like to thank the rapporteur for his work. We can only stress the fact that water has become a precious and rare resource. The rapporteur told us that 3.2 billion inhabitants on this planet could face a water shortage. We also know that Europe is not immune from this. Therefore, we should do everything possible to conserve this rare resource. Water is a shared asset and it is unfortunate that some of my amendments were not adopted by the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Food Safety. This is why I am addressing the Commission directly. I hope that, as part of the CAP reform, we will also review certain methods of cultivation – I am mainly thinking of irrigation techniques that are unsuitable for some European regions and which must be abandoned if we are to stop wasting water. It is also a shame that the amendment on the cooling of nuclear power stations was not taken into account because, in my own country France, at the time of year when river levels are very low, nuclear power stations have to be shut down or cooled using sprinklers. This is ridiculous, and is terribly dangerous for our citizens.

 Mr President, Commissioner, it was thanks to you that I was able to head the election observation mission to Mauritania. We were very proud of the results, because the great success was that after 24 years the military was handing over power to the people. I was in Mauritania for eight days last week and what did I hear there? I heard a people who, having previously been so happy to have a civilian government, were once again pleased that the military had come back to ‘readjust democracy’, as they put it. Of course we call that a coup d'état. It is a coup d'état. We denounce it and we have denounced it. However, I think that we really need to go and see what is happening there and I would advise you, my fellow Members, to send a delegation to find out. The representative from the African Union, Mr Ping, is calling it ‘an atypical situation’. Mr Djinnit of the United Nations calls it ‘a reversal situation’ and both are saying that today we have to be creative. Indeed, when they say that there is deadlock it is quite true that there is institutional deadlock, but this institutional deadlock does not come from the coup; it is the result of a process of degradation that dates back to April and that culminated in June or July with a motion of censure that could not be voted on, with extraordinary sittings of the parliament that were not adopted, that were not granted and, indeed, with a resounding majority of two thirds, if not three quarters in favour of the President, which found itself overturned, with the call for him to resign. This truly was a reversal and for those who are not following things it is difficult to comprehend. I would ask you, fellow Members, to go and see the situation as it really is and would call on you to support the democratic legacy that the country managed to acquire at the last elections. It should also be remembered that institutions such as the Senate, the parliament and the municipal councils are still functioning and I really believe that these bodies are acting as custodians of the people’s power. I therefore think that it is up to them to find a solution. I believe that we have to trust in our parliamentary colleagues to propose a roadmap to this military junta, which we have rejected, and that it is really up to the representatives of the people, just as we are the representatives of our citizens, to decide what to do now. I think that we can give them this credibility and show some trust in them: if they fail to come up with solutions that are lawful and institutionally legitimate then we can intervene forcefully, but I believe that today these representatives of the people, who have legitimacy on their side, should put forward proposals and we should give them our support as colleagues.

 Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I represented you in Georgia when I was sent there by our President from 12 to 17 August. I gave our full support to the Georgian people and reassured them by saying that the European Union would not abandon them. I therefore thank the Presidency for the efforts that were made to act very quickly in Georgia. Resolving this conflict is clearly a test for the European Union to which it has finally responded, but at what price? At the price once again of innocent citizens because these events were in fact inevitable. How long have some of us been preaching in the wilderness? Even those who are today saying that we must aim for integration and offer the prospect of accession to the European Union previously said to us: ‘wait, be reasonable’. Now we have a war between Russia and Georgia. When we said that this was not a conflict between Georgia and Abkhazia and South Ossetia, but that it was a conflict between Russia and Georgia, no one wanted to listen. Now we have one war behind us. Therefore these events were inevitable, particularly if you go back to other events or other times before the 11th. Let us go back to 2005 when Russia vetoed having border guards on the Russian-Georgian border. No one replied and even France – please excuse me Mr President – even France refused when we called for OSCE forces on the border. No one reacted. When the Russians violated Georgian airspace, we again had no response and the situation escalated. Now this regrettable war has occurred and we must not only rebuild, but also resolve the conflict. Of course we must have a conference on reconstruction, but we must also have a conference to resolve the conflict. I would ask you perhaps to use what happened in Kosovo as a model, in other words to put in place an international civil administration, together with peacekeeping forces. What Georgian citizen could now agree to the Russian army playing the role of policeman? (The President cut off the speaker)

Mr President, since there are not very many of us here, I too will take advantage of the opportunity to add, in the same spirit as Mr Morillon, that people actually expect a great deal from Europe and even today – as Mr von Wogau knows – Georgia, a country which is covered by our neighbourhood policy, is almost on the brink of war. Every day there are confrontations between Georgia and the separatist region of Abkhazia. I would say that the situation is becoming worse with every hour that passes. Moreover, this afternoon we have received an urgent appeal from the Georgian authorities, urging the European Union to become involved in resolving this conflict, and this just goes to show how much we need Europe. When we introduce a neighbourhood policy, then we must also take it upon ourselves to put it into practice.

Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, when it comes to fisheries agreements, we Greens have an interpretation which is slightly different from those of the other groups. We regard fisheries agreements as falling not only under the heading of purely and strictly commercial agreements, but also under the heading of European policies. That is why I shall be referring to the opinion of the Committee on Development, which also emphasises our commitments on providing development aid and supporting democracy and good governance. The question which we have already asked in the discussions within the Committee on Fisheries is why the Commission has threatened to terminate the fisheries agreements with Mauritania barely a year after they were signed. As far as we are concerned, fisheries agreements are not merely agreements in which we are allowed to utilise a resource and pay for it, and when we utilise less we pay less. No, we are cutting fishing opportunities because the European fishing fleet has utilised less in the areas concerned. Yet is it Mauritania’s responsibility, is it Mauritania’s fault, if the European fleet has gone elsewhere for certain fishing categories? We have always asked that fisheries resources be respected in other fisheries agreements, and we have always said that too much was being utilised and that in any case there would come a time when resources would be reduced. This is exactly what is happening at the moment. We agree with the Commission that resources should be restored to the level at which fishing is viable, and that that is a good thing. However, there is something else which we certainly do not agree with. During the discussions which took place we asked what would happen when the compensation is reduced in line with the level of fishing, so that the compensation would be reduced from EUR 86 million to EUR 70 million, which would mean that Mauritania’s income would be reduced by EUR 40 million over a period of three years. You told us, ‘There is no problem. We cannot switch from the fishing quota to something different, and decide to work on development instead’. We understand this too, and you undertook, on behalf of the Commission, to ensure that there would be compensation for those EUR 40 million as part of development policy. Yet today, in this agreement, we cannot see any sign of this compensation except in a footnote which says that the possibility of compensation exists. So we do not believe in this compensation, and I think that you have deceived Mauritania to some extent in this agreement, because no provision has been made for the agreed compensation. If you will permit, I should just like to remind you that when I was head of the EU mission covering the elections in Mauritania, the European Union undertook to support this young democracy, yet our first political act is to threaten to terminate the fisheries agreements. This is not, in my opinion, a policy of development aid, and I should really like to know what guarantee you can give us, as MEPs, regarding this compensation for the reduction decided on.

 Mr President, I too am pleased to welcome the French Presidency, with the French minister Mr Jouyet among us. It is true that it is unusual for the Presidency to be here on a Monday, even during these questions. I will indeed be talking about the deployment of the police, the riot police, in front of Parliament today. When I arrived earlier, I went through two riot police cordons. I wondered what could be posing such a threat to Parliament that such an armada of riot police should be deployed. Twice I had to state my identity; I was asked why I was in the area of the European Parliament. I was really very surprised, Mr Jouyet, because I do not feel threatened here and, on the contrary, I feel rather oppressed by all these barriers. I would like to remind you that surrounding the house of the European people with riot police is a strange way to begin the French Presidency and I am keen to point out that we want this house to remain a house of the people, open to citizens.

Mr President, we all know that democracy is not a long calm river, but we also know that it is democracy that we have chosen to organise our society. Therefore, as far as I am concerned, the Irish ‘no’ is no different to the French ‘no’ or the Dutch ‘no’ but, as in 2005, we were unable to explain why Europe is good for our citizens. We were unable to reassure them with regard to the ecological crisis that is hitting them head-on. However, I do not agree with speculation and I believe that we should wait until the end of the ratifications. Nonetheless, I would ask the Council to send a strong signal to the citizens to show that there is a genuine desire for transparency and a desire to reinforce democracy in relation to our fellow citizens. I would ask the Council to open its doors and I would ask that the Commission and Council Presidencies be appointed at the same time as the European elections. Yes, that would be a strong signal and we do not require ratification of the Treaty to make that type of change.

Mr President, Commissioner, as far as I am concerned, it takes two to tango. What I want to know is whether there is really enough interest on the other side of the Mediterranean. When we see today the dance the French Government is having to perform to actually bring the Mediterranean heads of state together, to get them to come to Paris on 13 July, I wonder if there is really the same commitment on the other side. I want to tell you that your revisited project is extremely interesting. The European Union was built after the war on the basis of coal and steel. If we are proposing to our partners that we build a project for the 21st
 century, based on climate change, on renewable energy, on the restoration of a Mediterranean environment that has been completely ruined, then yes, we can support this project. However, where is the consistency, Commissioner? What can we say to this solo by Mr Sarkozy, who even today, before his presidency, is urging Algeria to sign an agreement on the establishment of a nuclear plant? I think that that is a clear example of the contradiction that perhaps exists between the Council and the Commission.

Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, in order to reflect the reality of the situation in Georgia, I would like to add a phrase after ‘South Ossetia and Abkhazia’. I will read it to you in poor English, for which I apologise.  ‘Deplores, in this regard, the decision taken by the Russian Ministry of Defence on 31 May 2008 to send its forces to Abkhazia to restore the rail and road infrastructure in the breakaway region in accordance with the presidential decree’.

 Mr President, it is a pleasure for me to speak before these delegations since we have such close ties with them. It is precisely on the South Caucasus, would you believe, High Commissioner, that I would like to focus my intervention. We heard the good news that you will be going to Georgia for a couple of days tomorrow. It was high time that this happened and I thank you for that. You will also be going to Abkhazia and on that point, you explained that the weekend might not be enough time to resolve the issue. If you manage to do it in a weekend, I will be the first to congratulate you. This is a hard task, we know, but the most important thing is that the European Union is engaging in it. In my opinion, this is almost a test of the maturity of EU foreign policy. We know that Russia, which is one of our partners, is now involved in the conflict. According to the UN report, Georgia has agreed to suspend UAV flights over Abkhazia. However, yesterday we learnt that Russia has deployed its military forces to supposedly build railways. If that is the case, I think it is too early to talk about peacekeeping forces. This is therefore a difficult task. You said that you were going to support Georgia’s peace plan, so my question to you, High Commissioner, is this: are you also going to support, as part of this peace plan, the introduction of an Abkhaz-Georgian civil police force supervised by the EU or the OSCE? This would be a real step forward, and one that we have been waiting for from the EU for a long time in this conflict, since this is a neighbouring country. Therefore, the question that arises today, and which our fellow Members have just asked, is this: are we going to develop the Neighbourhood Policy as part of our foreign policy?

 Madam President, Commissioner, Mr Lenarčič, I am also speaking for the delegation; I am in fact chairwoman of the European Parliament delegation to the three Caucasus countries. You are right to say that the situation is worrying and serious, and I do not think we can just stand by and watch this escalation in provocation. Personally, I would say it almost amounted to the annexation of one country by another. When Russia withdrew in March from the sanctions regime ordered by the CIS, it opened up for itself the possibility of giving military assistance to Abkhazia. On 16 April, Russia legalised the bilateral relations and official documents of Abkhazia and South Ossetia. Surely this means recognition, indirectly, of these two separatist regions? Then of course, on 24 April, Russia unilaterally increased the number of troops and sent armed equipment. We do not know. Even the UN, in the country, does not know how much Russia has increased its peacekeeping forces. As my colleagues have said, we were in Gali last week and apparently there was nothing that justified increasing these troops, up from 2 000 to 3 000 troops. For any fellow Members who do not know, this agreement dates from 1994 when Russia put itself forward as a mediator and suggested sending peacekeeping forces on to Abkhazian territory, between the Abkhazian area and the area of Abkhazia where the Georgian populations were living. Today, as the CIS talks about diversity, only Russian troops are present. As a mediator ourselves we might ask the question: what kind of result has this mediation achieved? I also want to ask what our responsibility is. I have, of course, heard all your suggestions, but I think that at the moment we need to stop the escalation of violence. I also heard the Council’s last two statements. The European Union is only supporting the restoration of trust. Mr Lenarčič, there is no trust today in this area. There is not even dialogue any more. Abkhazia broke off its dialogue with Georgia in 2006. As regards communication by the European Union, the Commission is also taking steps. It is saying that the European Union will only get involved in this conflict if both parties present ask for it. In response, I can say: that will never happen. Russia will never ask us to help sort out the problem because Russia has always said it was not a stakeholder in this conflict. Therefore, the issue of the European Union’s responsibility now arises. Though you also announce that there is UN support, we know very well that there is complete deadlock at the UN, and failure too, because when there was a call for a UN resolution, Russia did not respond. Russia is therefore also stalling this process. I believe that with this we have enough arguments, as well as the possibility of helping in a much more concrete way. This is no longer a question of conflict resolution; we are clearly at the stage of preventing a possible conflict. We therefore need to act, and that is why, in the context of the resolution we voted for in Tbilisi last week, we are considering, for example, suggesting that Russia share the burden of peacekeeping by sending a civil peace corps over there. I think we should remember the Balkans. I think history will not forgive us for failing to act a second time. The Balkan war should have been the last, and I think it is up to us to nip the conflict in the South Caucasus in the bud.

 Mr President, thank you for upholding gender equality. Personally, I would also like to congratulate the rapporteurs for the three reports, but I would also just like to highlight the importance of the observation missions we conduct throughout the world. I believe this should be restated: these are particularly positive actions which should really be promoted among our fellow citizens, particularly perhaps in the run-up to elections. Can I also just pay tribute to all the observers, because at the end of the day, although as chief observers we are present on the ground, although we also go on observation missions, we do have hundreds of experts – young and not-so-young – throughout the world, who generously go and support democracy in other countries. I do not think that we mention this often enough. Without this network of observers, we would not have these excellent observation missions. I would also like to mention the enthusiasm with which populations welcome these observers, particularly the long-term observers who remain in the country for some time. However, I am disappointed that my fellow Members did not support my amendment aimed at increasing the budget, because I think that the more expertise we have in electoral missions, the more the European Union will be in demand. It would be a real shame if a lack of resources prevented us from responding to these requests from countries.

Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, according to consistent witness evidence, Omar Mohamed Saleh was arrested at his home by armed men in uniform on 3 February 2008. Since then, there has been no official word and his family and political colleagues fear that after his arrest he was cold-bloodedly executed. This lack of information cannot be allowed to continue and President Idriss Deby must pass on the information that he has. We are therefore calling on the French Government in particular, which has, as we know, provided aid to the President of Chad, to obtain all possible information on the disappearance of Mohamed Saleh, about whom we are extremely concerned, and also on the fate of all the other political prisoners. That cannot, in any event, disguise the tragic situation of over a million people caught in the crossfire. For that reason, it is imperative to open dialogue between all the parties, the Chad Government, the opposition and the rebels, to which they committed themselves with a view to free elections in 2009, in accordance with international standards. The aim of the Eufor mission is to keep the peace between Chad and Sudan and to guarantee the security of humanitarian operations to aid refugees on all sides. The mission cannot succeed without the active participation of all the European Union countries. In addition, since Eurofor includes a large contingent of French forces, it is essential to distinguish between the Épervier plan and the European forces. It is also imperative for the millions of refugees, as an initial emergency measure, but also in the longer term for the countries of Central Africa, that political stability should be restored by a ceasefire, reopening of dialogue and respect for human rights.

 Commissioner, Minister, I believe that it is deeply shocking to suggest that our security is threatened by the starving people who come her to seek work so that they can support the families they have left behind. I would remind my fellow Members of the speech Mr Kofi Annan gave when we awarded him the Sakharov Prize. He asked us to do the exact opposite of what we are doing: he asked us to open our borders. When we look into the future slightly, we can see only too well that we will need these workers because we are going to have a shortage of labour in the European Union. What are we doing then? We are building walls and we are going to choose who is allowed to enter: we are going to choose the people we need. That is totally unacceptable. We need a different policy; a policy that is open to all these people. However, what I want to know is what Frontex hopes to do, for example, in the countries of transit? In this respect, I will mention Mauritania, which I am familiar with since the European Union sent me there as the head of the election observation mission. We made a commitment to this poor country to help it with its transition to democracy. It has to manage the flows of immigrants travelling through the country on their way to the Canaries.

 Mr President, this is obviously not the first time that we have discussed biodiversity and that we have asked the Council and the Commission to defend biodiversity. That we have managed to make climate change an EU priority is a positive step, but we must realise, however, that the Conventions on biodiversity and desertification are somewhat eclipsed by this climate change. We know how important biodiversity or, when it comes down it, nature protection is for our own survival because we can see that, despite the measures taken at European or global level, the erosion of biodiversity is continuing; the extinction of species is continuing. We must face the facts: although we might try to curb climate change, the same cannot be said for the species. Once a species is extinct, that is it: it is gone forever. This issue, this evidence must be fully integrated. When we know, for example, that we have excellent tools such as Natura 2000 and the Birds and Habitats Directives to combat the degradation of biodiversity in the European Union, and when we see today that there are still certain Member States that are reluctant to implement Natura 2000, that are reluctant to pay for Natura 2000, it is very clear that we still have a long way to go. As a result, I genuinely hope that the Commission will continue to support Natura 2000 and continue to support these two Directives. I would also ask that in the framework of the Bonn Convention you establish criteria for biofuels but also demand and obtain agreement on the creation of a group of intergovernmental experts on biodiversity, like the IPCC for climate change, because we could help others to put in place tools that we ourselves are introducing but they have not yet introduced.

 Commissioner, I want to put a question to you. Do you not feel slightly alone within the Commission? What you are proposing to us is something revolutionary. I am not talking about adaptation because I think that talking about adaptation alone is perhaps not the best solution since we have not yet quantified the consequences. What are the real consequences of climate change? At present, we really do not know. However, we will certainly be able to quantify the consequences if we do nothing. We also know why we have reached this point. It is simply the result of the policies we have put in place: the agricultural policy, the economic policy, etc. Obviously then today we must question the policies we continue to implement, for example when striving for growth. Surely we should be asking ourselves what type of growth we want today in order to slow down climate change. What does it mean today to ask for growth in all our Member States? These are fundamental questions, Mr Dimas, that you are asking us to raise today, because this is not just a matter for the Commission or for the Temporary Committee on Climate Change. It is a matter that affects the whole world today and every one of us. I do not like this manner, shall we say, of perhaps absolving ourselves of responsibility, and maybe even misleading our fellow citizens by trying to get them to believe that we can adapt to climate change and that at the end of the day the situation may not be as serious because we are going to have the means to adapt to it. No, Commissioner, that would really be pulling the wool over their eyes. Since we are at the beginning of the proposals on this issue, we are in the process of preparing an energy package and we know how much resistance there will be to achieving the level of results we desire, which is nonetheless a minimum minimorum
. As you can see, we have a long road ahead of us. I am not saying that what you are proposing is bad. It is encouraging, but the revolution you are proposing will have to be quantified in order to convince the other Commissioners that we need to go in another direction. You will have to convince the Agriculture Commissioner that we need to go in another direction. You will have to convince Mr Louis Michel that we need to mention climate change in the partnership agreements with Africa. We need to reshape our African policies, and this policy will have to incorporated into the synergy we have created with the African countries. Today or tomorrow Mr Sarkozy is going to propose a Union for the Mediterranean. What has he proposed to combat climate change? These countries are directly involved. I wish you luck, Commissioner, for your job is undoubtedly going to be extremely difficult.

 Madam President, the energy and climate package marks the arrival of a new kind of blackmail: blackmail using carbon emissions. Having announced 575 job losses at Gandrange in Moselle on 4 April 2008, Arcelor-Mittal is agreeing to keep 124 jobs on the site provided that it can have CO2
 emissions certificates. And to sweeten the pill of the job losses in Lorraine, Arcelor-Mittal is allowing rumours to circulate of a possible pilot CO2
 capture project, although this process has not yet been validated in terms of its energy neutrality. Gandrange in Moselle is becoming the Trojan horse of the energy-intensive industries, with their great defender in the European Council, the French President, Mr Sarkozy. I am delighted that the Commissioner is with us because I would really like us to reject this new kind of blackmail using carbon emissions. To be effective, the energy and climate package must follow the beat of European legislation. The European Parliament must demand that the Council comply with the rules we are set and not give in to the sirens of industry seeking free quotas. We as co-legislator must ensure fair access to quotas for European SMEs against the large industrial companies.

Mr President of the Council, Mr President of the Commission, Mr President of Parliament, the icecap is melting and this morning Mr Pachauri, head of the IPCC and Nobel laureate, told us of his concerns. He spoke about the possible sudden increase in the sea level and we are aware of the consequences that would entail. Of course, we must act quickly and effectively, and the 10% biofuel target will have a negative effect when we are hoping for the best. Ladies and gentlemen, we must prevent this poor decision and adopt a positive approach instead: let us do away with the 10% target. Finally, Mr Barroso, I would like to put one question to you: I would like to know why you did not tell President Sarkozy that the European Union already had a European Neighbourhood Policy and it was entirely unnecessary to invent a new structure: one that, at the end of the day, would be an office of 20 people whose job would be to resolve the problems of the Mediterranean, without any consultation. I personally believe that it is actually an insult to our Mediterranean partners that they were not consulted about the establishment of this project for a Union – a symbolic term for those of us who are part of the European Union – for the Mediterranean.

Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, will the tragic events that have occurred in Armenia since the presidential election on 19 February 2008 send out the message that Europe is incapable of supporting the fragile little democracies of the South Caucasus in their struggle to become established? Following the crisis in Georgia, it is now Armenia’s turn to suffer major political upheaval. Despite the high level of attention directed at the country during the election campaign, the international community failed to promote the dialogue that might have prevented the clashes on 1 March. After 11 days of protest against the election results by the opposition movement under former head of state Levon Ter-Petrosian, police tried to disperse the demonstrators. The situation degenerated, resulting in the deaths of eight people, injuries to many others and the imposition of a state of emergency with curbs on freedom of information and freedom of assembly, as well as restrictions on political parties. Since then, 400 people have been arrested. There is an evident mood of anxiety among the population, who fear that a policy of repression will be imposed. We have a duty today, in our contacts with all the parties involved in the Armenian conflict, to reflect that fear. The question, however, is what we should propose as a method of bringing all sides to their senses and getting them to the negotiating table against the current backdrop of heightened tension? That is the challenge. We need to restore the confidence of ordinary Armenian men and women in their fledgling democracy. Essential preconditions for restoring confidence are the setting up of an inquiry into the recent events and the release of those imprisoned. The next step – in conjunction with the international community, our Special Representative to the South Caucasus and our partners in the Council of Europe and the OSCE – must be to fix a timescale for our Armenian friends to return to the negotiating table, and we must bring all the conflicting parties to the table, on both the official and the opposition sides. The rules of democracy depend upon dialogue and non-violence and it is up to us to facilitate such an approach. With your permission, Mr President, I should like to propose an oral amendment. I am not sure how to proceed for the fact is that we made a mistake in the resolution. In recital H we referred to the territory of Nagorno-Karabakh where we should have said the status of Nagorno-Karabakh. It would seem that my colleagues agree with the oral amendment.

 Mr President, Mr President-in-Office, spring summits leave a bad taste in my mouth. It is true that we are celebrating the 50th anniversary of Europe, and it is good to remember these things. However, gentlemen, I also remember the Gothenburg summit, which was an enormous ecological victory because the Heads of State or Government reached an agreement to hold the spring summit to take stock of the sustainable development of our EU policies in the fields of environmental health, health and social integration. In Europe, for example, Mittal-Arcelor, the energy-intensive organisation par excellence
, is set to cut 600 jobs amid monster profits, and the EU is poised to give it free greenhouse gas emission quotas. Our citizens are now distraught and our young people anguished by the legacy we are bequeathing them. Gentlemen, you are announcing a revolution when you propose, for instance, that greenhouse gas emissions ought to be reduced by 20%. We know this is well below what has to be done. For example, Lester Brown, who visited us last week, was choked by emotion as he told us emissions would have to be reduced by 80% between now and 2020 if there is to be any chance of reversing the trend. Therefore, gentlemen, I do not believe in your project: it is well below what is required, and is totally inadequate for the environmental crisis endangering the entire planet.

Mr President, like Mr Solana and Mrs Ferrero-Waldner, I do not see any difference between civil and military nuclear power. Mr Solana has explained to us that uranium is all that is needed to make a bomb. I think one would have to be a little naïve to believe that a country as rich in natural resources as Iran needs nuclear energy for its development. On the other hand, we know very well that it needs nuclear energy to make the bomb. Mr Solana has also said that nuclear energy is a cause of instability and we do not have any influence over Iran. He is quite right. We entirely agree with his proposal that enrichment should be banned. I shall even go further than that: I think nuclear energy should simply be banned. Only 4% of energy worldwide is nuclear at the moment. The question I should like to ask Mr Solana and Mrs Ferrero-Waldner is this: do they not think that France, and its President Mr Sarkozy, are playing with fire and creating instability in the world by signing nuclear agreements with countries like Libya, China and Georgia? Could we not use the unhappy experience of Iran as an opportunity to put a stop to nuclear proliferation in the world?

 Madam President, Commissioner, congratulations, first of all, to our two rapporteurs. The report by Mrs Polfer comes just at the right time because, with the events in Georgia, we can see firsthand the difficulties of building democracy. This report is balanced, and sets out the major geostrategic challenges of the South Caucasus. It is important to remember that the neighbourhood policies commit us to supporting and accompanying these countries. We have a political and moral responsibility towards them, but they also have one towards us, particularly as regards human rights and freedom of expression, as you pointed out, Commissioner. For these three countries our support should also be more concerned with resolving the conflicts. Currently, the EU is only managing them. Without a political compromise between Armenia and Azerbaijan over Nagorno-Karabakh, without a peace plan between Georgia on the one hand and South Ossetia and Abkhazia on the other, these countries will not be able to restore relationships of trust or establish lasting stability between themselves and with their larger neighbours. As regards supporting democracy, we are doing this every day. Unfortunately, the events that shook Georgia pushed it into a political crisis that it has still not found a way out of, with the opposition taking to the streets to challenge the results of the first round of the presidential elections. Of course, by responding to the call for the President to resign, Mr Saakashvili caught the opposition unawares, leaving it very little time to organise the elections. Of course, this election campaign was not fair because two candidates were able to deploy considerably greater resources than the others. Of course, the campaign was marred by allegations and revelations of the orchestration of a post-election coup d’état by an opposition candidate, but nevertheless it should be noted that on election day – and we were there as observers – no major incidents were reported by the observers, and there had never been so many of them in such a small country to observe elections. With the international community and national and international NGOs, we were able to witness the freedom of expression of citizens generally, even if many irregularities and much intimidation were noted, though nothing systematic. In our conclusion, we stressed the obligation to continue the legal proceedings, to take all the complaints into consideration and not to consider the results definitive until all the disputes had been looked into, and dozens of polling stations were thus cancelled. Today, however, the situation has not been settled at all, and we must continue to appeal to Georgia’s leaders, on all political sides, to resume and continue the dialogue; we must appeal to the authorities to hear the opposition’s claims; and we must appeal to the opposition, which gained credibility during these elections, to assume its share of the responsibility for suggesting compromises, because Georgia really needs to get back to where it was before, the place it occupied after the Rose Revolution, that of a country that has turned the page on violence and instability. That is what Georgia’s people are demanding, and that is what they are also asking of the European Union today, and we must stick by them.

 The enlargement of the European Union calls for our solidarity with the population of the 431 000 km2
 around the Black Sea. This solidarity is expressed by the agreement to open negotiations with Turkey, the implementation of the Neighbourhood Policy with Georgia and Ukraine, and the strategic partnership established with Russia. The violence of the storm makes us think about the effects of climate change, in our own neighbourhood too. A risk management policy is required that combines both prevention and the protection of biodiversity. We remember that the storm trapped four vessels and caused the death of eight sailors. A Russian cargo vessel also broke in two, releasing 4 000 tonnes of fuel oil on a migration route for diving birds coming from Siberia. The European Union sent a team within the framework of the Monitoring and Information Centre. More should be done as part of this initiative. To prevent future disasters, the EU must make sure that high safety standards are systematically applied to the fleet of Russian vessels. The EU must impose the use of double-hull cargo vessels on its Russian partner, for transporting oil. As the parliamentary assembly of the BSEC meets, we should be demanding the application of the standards in the European maritime safety package.

 Mr President, Mr President-in-Office of the Council, Commissioner, I wish first of all to say that we in the European Parliament delegation attended two summits: first the parliamentary pre-summit with our colleagues from the Pan-African Parliament, and also the official summit. Mr President-in-Office of the Council, I think you cannot be aware of the status we had there, in other words the degrading status of observers: Members of the European Parliament, even if they had worked well on previous occasions, had no access to the official summit. I very much wished to inform the House of this, and I feel that we, as Members of the European Parliament, represent European citizens in the same capacity as heads of state or government. Thus it would be right if we were also represented at the next summit. The official summit, however, was a splendid initiative, and it is good to know that it has been held after seven years of failed attempts. I do feel, however, that the main lesson to be learned from the summit is that the African continent is finally becoming emancipated and organised as an African unit, and this is certainly good news. This reminds me of the discussions we had at our parliamentary pre-summit with the Commissioner, where we stressed the contradiction between, on the one hand, the political display of the EU’s vision and the new approach to its partners, and, on the other hand, the pressure exerted by the EU to get the economic partnership agreements signed. I now wish to ask the Commissioner about the status of these partnerships, these interim agreements to be signed, because I must remind you that the African countries rejected this type of agreement and this kind of pressure. Finally, Commissioner, another question on a matter of some concern: the nuclear issue. The question from the Group of the Greens is as follows: why did nuclear talks commence with African countries? African countries are now in need of renewable energy. Our technology, our solar energy, photovoltaic systems and wind-energy systems are truly suited to Africa. What, then, was the reason, particularly when we are aware of the difficulties this can entail, such as with Iran at the moment? Why, Mr Vice-President? This is a very important question. I would also like to know which country forced the EU to add the nuclear issue to the strategy. Was it my president, the worldwide nuclear sales representative? This is totally unbelievable. It is renewable forms of energy that Africa needs at the present time.

 Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, we remember the WHO appeal launched on 5 October 2006, challenging the international community to improve air quality. Very strict standards needed to be adopted for atmospheric pollution, and the target was to cut the number of deaths in polluted cities by 15%. The European Union, often at the forefront of environmental regulations, was a great disappointment at the first reading, to the point that our Environment Commissioner Mr Dimas was personally outraged at the position of the European Parliament, which was weakening legislation in force that already had few teeth. At the second reading on 9 October 2007, the Verts had alerted the Committee on the Environment to the counterproductive effects of administrative simplification and more specifically to the increase in the permitted number of days on which the maximum values could be exceeded and the extension of the exemptions of certain pollutants. The recently negotiated compromise at the European Parliament’s second reading is a damage limitation exercise on the first reading. Regarding PM2,5
 in urban areas, a new limit value is proposed of 20 micrograms per cubic metre, which is to be reviewed by the European Commission in 2015. Of course, additional measures can be implemented to take account of the circumstances of sensitive populations such as children and the elderly. Although it is an improvement on the initial situation, this compromise does not constitute a major step forward for the European Parliament. It will not force Member States to take the restrictive measures necessary to improve the health of the European people. The impact of atmospheric pollution is still being estimated at a nine-month reduction in life expectancy for our fellow citizens. We therefore need to go further, integrating the restriction of particles in suspension earlier on using preventive instruments aimed at limiting emissions from various sectors, particularly transport, and those from industry.

 Mr President, in paragraph 9 I would like to replace:   ‘welcomes the readiness of the Georgian authorities to allow international observers to monitor the elections’ by ‘welcomes the call of the Georgian authorities for international observers to monitor the elections’.  This makes the text a closer reflection of what is actually happening.

 Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, again for the sake of clarity, and because an inquiry is currently being conducted, I would like to delete the reference to 90 %, so we would delete ‘up to 90%’ and replace it with ‘part’, so it will read ‘with part of the station’s ...’, etc.

 Mr President, the Georgian Constitution contains the terms ‘referendum’ and ‘plebiscite’, which are not the same thing. I therefore propose that we replace the term ‘referendum’ with ‘plebiscite’, to bring this into line with the Georgian Constitution.

Mr President, I should like to say, firstly, that I am sorry this is a joint debate because the crisis in Georgia ought to have been the subject of a debate in its own right. Last weekend, the President of this House sent me to Georgia. I have just returned and I should have liked to deliver a report on events there and the various meetings I had. Two minutes – sadly – will not be long enough for me to do that. Before talking about Georgia, however, I should like to welcome the latest arrival among the European Neighbourhood Policy countries, namely Mauritania – a country which I recently visited as head of our election observation mission there. What is clear today is that the serious crisis in Georgia has certainly put our European Neighbourhood Policy to the test. Can this neighbourhood policy be really useful? It is now legitimate to ask that question in the light of the situation in Georgia. What I can tell you, colleagues, is that, four years on from the non-violent Rose Revolution, the communities in Georgia are truly shocked by the violence of which we saw something on our television screens: the violence directed against Georgia’s people and the violence used to close down Imedi TV. They are shocked because they do not understand what is going on. I am therefore grateful to the Commission for calling on the Georgian authorities to instigate an inquiry – an independent and transparent investigation – because people want to know exactly what happened and how it happened. We visited the country and, of course, we heard two versions of events: the opposition version and the authorities’ version. Both are admissible. It is very clear that two versions exist, but people are calling for genuine transparency. Obviously we must remember not only, as our colleague reminded us, that Georgia is vulnerable – and we do know that – but also that Georgia has to compromise with a ‘big brother’ constantly lying in wait to catch it out. When the Georgian authorities draw our attention to Russia’s omnipresence, we need to consider the sort of things that happen. We had an example with our visa facilitation arrangement with Russia, benefiting people from Abkhazia and South Ossetia who hold Russian passports, even though these areas are part of Georgian territory, and thus placing Georgia in an awkward position. None of this is news to you, Commissioner. What we must demand today – in addition, obviously, to lifting of the state of emergency – is the immediate restoration of freedom of expression and media freedom and of course, most importantly, an assurance that there will be free and transparent elections. Georgia today is capable of organising such elections. It demonstrated that just last year when it held transparent, democratic local elections in full accordance with international standards. It is now time – and I am addressing the Council here, for I believe it has been somewhat harsh with the Georgian authorities – for us, with our European Neighbourhood Policy, to demonstrate that we can be useful. We need to show the people of Georgia that there is some point to the ENP. The European Union must not let them down. That is the message we should convey very strongly to the Georgian authorities.

 Madam President, I would also first like to congratulate our rapporteurs and applaud the difficult job Mrs Gutiérrez has accomplished in producing a result to protect our soil. Unlike other fellow Members, I believe a more restrictive legislative approach would have provided better protection. I also think it is a pity that our fellow Members whose countries have stricter regulation than that proposed here are still trying to water down this report with amendments that I would urge you very strongly to reject tomorrow. Our agricultural and industrial activities and transport plans have drastically affected the quality of our soil. However, this same soil is the foundation of biodiversity and our food. It filters and stores organic matter and minerals, and also helps us to access water. It plays a prominent role in the fight against climate change. Furthermore, faced with growing demand for food and energy production, it is essential that we safeguard and restore the quality of our soil and prevent desertification. Without legislation at European level, we cannot hope for results.

Mr President, I have asked for the floor because I am not quite sure what is going on. I took part in the discussions on these various reports in the Committee on the Environment but it seemed to me that what Mrs Klaß has just presented was not the report that the committee had approved unanimously, but rather a reflection of her personal position. I would therefore like to know whether we may hope for a more objective presentation of the Environment Committee’s position on this very important report.

Mr President, Commissioners, whilst I should like to congratulate Ms Breyer on the excellent outcome she has achieved, I cannot support those who defend the use of pesticides, because it is absolutely vital that we rid our environment and our bodies of these dangerous substances. I hope that the European Parliament may in future support the most forward-looking positions on this question, instead of yielding to the latest siren calls from manufacturers representing a deadly industry. Eliminating carcinogenic, mutagenic and reprotoxic pesticides, and substances that weaken our nervous and endocrine systems and damage our immune systems, is an entirely healthy aim. We should also welcome our fellow Members’ efforts to ensure transparency in the provision of information for consumers, who are the ‘innocent victims’ of these dangerous substances. Surely, Commissioners, it is high time that action was taken? Never before have insecticides, fungicides and herbicides of various types been used as systematically as they are used today. To look no further than France, a situation that can only be described as ‘joint management’ of public policy on pesticides by the state and the chemical industry has succeeded thus far in marginalising ordinary people’s expectations about public and environmental health, regardless of research findings on environmental toxicity and at the expense of statistical studies if they establish links between chemical substances and pathological conditions: all this despite recent warnings from the medical profession, via the Paris Appeal for example, and the Grenelle Forum on Environment in France. The industry is doing its utmost to play down the impact of pesticides. Thus, after the pollution of water courses by the herbicide Atrazine, which everyone has heard about, and the decimation of bee populations, the chemical industry is trying to draw a veil over the fact that France remains the European Union’s number one pesticide user. Every year, between 70 000 and 80 000 tonnes of pesticides are poured into our environment in France. So, in relation to the ‘pesticides package’ – unlike the REACH directive – the Members of this House will not allow themselves to be discredited. Ordinary people expect no less of us: that is clear from the mass of correspondence we receive, calling for swift and strong action. We hear, for example, from people highlighting the dangers of inhaling pesticides that are sprayed by vegetable growers in the south of France, and from others concerned about heavy use of herbicides in public parks and gardens, prompting some to call for pesticide-free zones.

 Madam President, I would like to thank our rapporteur. Energy has become a geostrategic issue once again. It is also the Achilles heel of the European Union. Since it cannot meet its energy needs alone, the EU is striving to diversify its sources of supply under trade agreements signed with countries in Latin America, Africa and Eurasia. The recent disagreement between the European Union and Russia over the Energy Charter is a sign that energy security has entered a new era. Faced with dwindling oil resources, the ever-present nuclear risk and the advent of energy powers such as Russia and Brazil, it is also vital to restate the EU’s sustainable development policy. In this respect, a coherent foreign policy will reflect the renewable energy targets set by the Spring European Council. It will also make energy efficiency a premise of our external relations. It is not enough to insist on guarantees of uninterrupted supply from other countries, particularly neighbouring countries. We must also ensure that there is real coordination between the 27 Member States. In fact, energy security means a loss of sovereignty in a European sector which has now become strategic. The pressure that energy supply places on governments should not make us rush these decisions or neglect the principles we have worked on together. As the previous President of the European Parliament reminded President Putin, human rights cannot be negotiated in return for our energy needs. On the contrary, we must make our supply conditional on respect for human rights.

 Mr President, if we mean to tackle global warming and to translate this ambitious road map into practice, it is absolutely essential that we make the link between energy and environment. Of course, we have warned repeatedly that the Member States will not achieve the target of a 12% share for renewable energy by 2010. So how can we expect them to achieve 20% by 2020? The Commission’s method of development calculation fails to take into account the environmental costs of energy production and we continue to produce energy policies piecemeal, whereas what we need is an integrated, comprehensive approach. Energy is an area of policy where we are capable of doing much better and achieving rapid results. For example, energy efficiency needs to be promoted so that all of us can eliminate unnecessary spending on energy. Administrative procedures also need to be simplified. In France, for instance, you have to complete a bureaucratic obstacle course in order to fit a solar panel: no fewer than seven separate procedures are involved in turning an energy consumer into an energy producer. However, what we do must also be consistent with cooperation for development. What are the Union’s proposals for developing renewable energy sources under the partnership agreements with the ACP countries? When we talk of solar power, for example, the poorest nations tell us that they simply cannot afford the technology. And what about those Member States that finance the cultivation of biofuels in countries in the South? In Africa and Asia, jatropha plantations are springing up even in regions where drought is a problem and where the demands of food security are pressing. Not only that, but the Union bears responsibilities towards the third countries that supply our raw materials for energy production. European investment in Niger’s uranium mines or in the Chad-Cameroon oil pipeline must be accompanied by transfers of technology for clean energy production based on microprojects. The energy crisis, Mr President, is an environmental crisis; it calls for emergency plans and binding policy measures. We need to pull out all the stops on renewable energy.

Mr President, I also wanted to welcome the report on behalf of my group, the Greens and EFA. I believe, however, that any analysis of the work of the Joint Parliamentary Assembly must be primarily political. In this respect, can we be satisfied with the state of the African, Caribbean and Pacific countries after years of a development policy in which the Union has been the largest provider of funds? That is the question. And what progress has been made on the road to democracy? In the course of our regular visits to these countries, we have been forced to conclude that human misery is growing there and that democracy is still very much in its infancy. Even if our work in the Joint Assembly is proceeding well, as Mr Cornillet assures us, it must not be the tree that hides the rest of the wood, for we have the means to go further, further in mutual respect of our European interests and, of course, in meeting the expectations of the ACP countries. There is hope – as illustrated, for example, by the process of transition to democracy that has begun in Mauritania. What the Union still needs to do – and I am addressing the Commission here – is to honour its commitments by helping the Mauritanians to make a successful transition and to re-establish decent living conditions. Support from the Joint Parliamentary Assembly for the Mauritanian National Assembly could be one step in that direction. Come what may, Commissioner, I would like to focus on the fight against poverty. We have discussed this at length. It has to be said that combating poverty involves the resolution of environmental issues, to which insufficient consideration is given in our work – and I am addressing Mr Cornillet here. I would also like to mention the report on sustainable development that was produced as part of our work on the action plans which are now being implemented by the ACP countries. What do we do to stop desertification, which is driving hundreds of African to flee into squalid shanty towns or to set out, even at the risk of their lives, for an imagined European El Dorado? That is the question, and the world is waiting for an answer.

Mr President, Commissioner, this is a battle that should have all of us rallying to the flag. It is a matter of public health and even of public safety. We know the dangers, the ravages of mercury on the health of those who come into contact with it. Since the start of the industrial age, the problems have only worsened to assume alarming proportions. Since Minamata and the chain of horrors emanating from that disastrous saga of industrial pollution, we have been even more clearly aware that mercury is dreadfully dangerous. Nevertheless, we have carried on regardless, almost as if nothing had ever happened. Throughout the intervening period, the God Mercury has continued to exact a heavy tribute from native populations in gold-washing areas, such as French Guyana, and the same applies to those on the other side of the globe who, in unimaginable conditions, recycle our industrial, electronic and other waste, not to mention the workers in Europe who operate in battery-recycling plants. Yes, it is high time we got rid of this poison, and the only solution is a pure and simple ban here in Europe and throughout the rest of the world, because this poison is everywhere, even in the organs of polar bears, for example, which live where it is neither produced nor used. I regret that my group’s proposals for a more rapid prohibition were not adopted and that underground storage was not rejected. Be that as it may, this is no longer the time for regrets but for securing the largest possible majority in support of a definitive ban on this dangerous metal.

Madam President, Minister, Commissioner, the reports follow each other but are not alike, since we are at present going to deal with biodiversity. Minister, this week will have been marked by the desire shown by the European Parliament to fight against the loss of biodiversity. On Monday, the report by our fellow Member, Mr Amadou, and the report on Life+ were debated and, today, we are examining two oral questions tabled ahead of the next meeting of the Conference of the parties to the Convention on international trade in endangered species of wild flora and fauna, the CITES. Our Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Food Safety, whose chairman I excuse for not being able to be here with us, questions the Member States’ negotiating method and asks the European Council what key objectives the Union will uphold during the fourteenth meeting of the Conference of the parties to the CITES Convention, which will be held, as you said, Madam President, in the Hague on 14 and 15 June 2007. The CITES Convention is one of the oldest multilateral environmental protection instruments. It was adopted in 1973, in Washington, by States that were already anxious to go beyond the national regulatory frameworks. The aim was to preserve wild plants and animals from commercial overexploitation. The significance of this Convention compared with the other multilateral agreements on the environment is its great power of adaptation. It directly influences trade through supply, which it restricts. In very practical terms, it influences around 500 000 transactions – that is no small amount, 500 000 commercial transactions! – thereby restricting the overexploitation of biodiversity. With the coming on board of the various institutional partners, nearly 170 States, including our 27 Member States, of scientists and NGOs, the CITES Convention will have made it possible to prevent the removal of particularly endangered species and to save species such as the Siberian tiger, the blue whale and African elephants. Of course, the challenges facing the Convention are many. On the one hand, they are structural. The Convention struggles, in fact, to find funding to match its ambitions. It has to deal with the over-consumption of natural species, some of which are not always listed. On the other hand, the Convention must take account of new data, including, of course, climate change. It must incorporate the ineffectiveness of certain instruments, such as the action plan for forest law enforcement, governance and trade, or FLEGT, with which everyone in this House is familiar. It must review also the decisions that have had a negative impact on certain species: for example, during the twelfth Conference of the parties, the permits for the sale of ivory originating from Botswana, Namibia and South Africa resulted in almost 20 000 elephants being decimated, according to estimates. As part of the fight against the loss of species, the European Union must at all costs speak with one voice during the conferences of the parties to the Convention. In this connection, I should like to point out, Minister, that the European Union often abstains when decisions are taken because our Member States do not manage to come to an agreement, with the result that 27 votes are lost, and 27 votes is not a negligible amount; it is even often a large amount. Therefore, Minister, we ask that the Council take account of Parliament’s resolution, which reflects the interests of the European people and conveys that which our citizens want us to defend within the context of this CITES Convention. Firstly, because the resolution points out certain requirements to the negotiators. Thus, the precautionary principle must be applied with the same rigour as that imposed by the European Union in other international negotiations on the environment. Equally, the Union must demand transparency in the voting process and reject secret ballots, a practice that really exists, especially when it comes to listing species in annexes. In fact, the point is to modernise this slightly antiquated procedure, which no longer in any way meets the requirements of the citizens, who must be able to exercise their right to inspect the decisions that are taken on their behalf. We know that the NGOs criticise the EU Member States at every turn for not disclosing their votes and for voting in secret ballots on certain species. We consider this to be totally unacceptable and we call for transparency, because this Convention is special and because the Member States, as we know, have specific interests where some subjects are concerned. The questions included in the agenda of the Conference must be submitted to the European Parliament. We do not expect anything less. Each time a Conference of the parties to the CITES Convention is announced, we put the same questions to the Council: we do not understand why we have not been consulted earlier, so that we know what positions the Council plans to uphold during the Conference. I should also like to ask the Commission and the Council to involve our parliamentary delegation in the work of the Conferences so that we are not forced, as we usually are, to skulk around the corridors in the hope of gleaning some information from them, and that is when the Council and the Commission see fit to invite us! I therefore thank you for involving the European Parliament delegation in the work done on the Convention.

Madam President, I should like first of all to thank Mr Gloser and Mrs Ferrero-Waldner for what I was almost tempted to call their reassuring words. However, I received no answer regarding the transparency of votes: I believe that it is crucial for us to know who votes for what within the European Union during this CITES conference. I should like to begin by also expressing my satisfaction with the proposal made by Germany to include two species of shark – the dogfish and the mackeral shark – in Annex II to the CITES, a proposal that has also been endorsed by many associations working to protect these species. In our view, this is a proposal that must gain full support because these two species, which are included in the IUCN Red Book of endangered species, require special attention. However, above and beyond the specific case of these species, we should also give greater consideration to the status of the other species of shark in the waters bordering the countries of the EU, in the Mediterranean, for example, so that, on this issue, the European Union is affected as much as the neighbourhood policy. In general, it must be recognised that the Mediterranean is an endangered sea: the indiscriminate withdrawal of fishery stocks over the last few decades, with the use of drift nets in particular, has resulted in a significant depletion of species. The case of bluefin tuna is one such example, which has been highly publicised recently by Greenpeace. Yet, what do we know, for example, about the sharks in the Mediterranean? What we know overall about sharks is that, throughout the world, they are totally endangered, overfished and that they are suffering from the deteriorating marine balance. That being said, does the European Union have any information or studies enabling it to assess the situation of the sharks in the Mediterranean? That is the question. If it does not have these, can it envisage serious studies being carried out so that, in the long term, it will be in a position to make concrete proposals, on the CITES in particular? Furthermore, we also think it crucial that red coral, which is also overfished in the Mediterranean, be included in Annex II to the CITES.

Minister, I was head of the election observation mission in Mauritania. I can tell you that not a week goes by without a boat arriving, running aground, and requesting assistance, during its voyage to the Canaries. These poor souls must be accommodated, and, as may sometimes be the case, they must be accommodated in the Mediterranean waters. I should therefore like to know what resources the European Union – this European Union that uses up so many resources on protecting its borders – is making available to neighbouring countries, that is to say, to Mauritania, which is a transit country – these countries are not migrant countries, but merely transit countries and host countries – and what resources the European Union is putting in place to help these countries to manage this issue.

Minister, you have given me exactly the same answer that Mrs Ferrero-Waldner gave me three times, but you are not in fact answering the question. The question concerns the facilitation of the visa system for persons residing on Georgian territory, in Abkhazia or South Ossetia, and to whom Russia has kindly offered nationality by issuing them with Russian passports – even though these people are Georgian – to the extent that the people of Georgia are subject to a system of double standards. My question is this: did you weigh up the fact that, when the visa system was facilitated for Russian citizens, those persons, to whom Russia has granted nationality, with passports in support of this, and who, residing on Georgian territory, are Georgians from Abkhazia or South Ossetia, were going to benefit from the facilitation of the visa system, while the people of Georgia themselves would not benefit from it?

Mr President, Mr Prodi, our ambition is to continue with European integration. True, we have misfired. By voting ‘no’ to the Constitutional Treaty, many French people believed that they were resisting a liberal Europe and thus hoped that that would help us to move towards a social and ecological Europe. Well, now we know that quite the opposite has happened. The ‘no’s have condemned our institutions to deadlock, and I share Prime Minister Prodi’s view that we must not throw the baby out with the bath water. Europe needs a constitution, and the compromise achieved by the Convention must be adopted and improved. So if, by a mini-treaty, as presented by the new French President, we mean the constitutional compromise and the Charter of Fundamental Rights, it will be a yes, a yes to a Foreign Minister. What weight will that Minister carry, however, Mr Prodi, without a genuine European foreign policy? Yes, Mr Prodi, the treaty still needs to be improved. If it had to be a third-rate treaty that is ratified on the sly, that would be unacceptable. The future of Europe is a matter for the people of Europe. I therefore say ‘yes’ to a European referendum being held simultaneously in the 27 countries, and why not during the next European elections? I say ‘yes’, so that Europe can tackle the present-day challenges – I am thinking in particular of climate change – that will radically transform our lives. I am convinced that our fellow citizens understand these challenges and will be able to move this tremendous European project forward.

Madam President, I am taking the floor on the subject of Africa in order to draw to your attention to the fact that it was too late to table an urgent resolution. I should therefore like to draw the MEPs’ attention to the situation in the north of Mali and the north of Niger, which is developing to the detriment of the Tuareg populations. Indeed, we can still prevent a major conflict and a war in this region where, today, the situation is deteriorating terribly, in spite of the Algiers agreements and the forum that took place in March in Kidal. The Tuaregs laid down their weapons on 9 March and, today, the Malian army is occupying the water points and certain villages while fresh troops are arriving from the south. Madam President, I believe that we need to intervene before a war breaks out in this part of Africa, at a time when the Algerian mediator is absent. Therefore, I would ask that you put an urgent request to the Commission and to the Presidency of the Council with the aim of having a troika speak to the Malian authorities so that they agree to return to the negotiating table with the Tuareg parties for the purposes of discussing the implementation of the Algiers agreements again. As far as Niger is concerned, the situation of the Tuaregs is no better because they are being exploited by companies engaged in uranium extraction, an activity from which the Tuaregs derive no benefit whatsoever.

Madam President, I too should like to begin by congratulating our rapporteur on his excellent work. Of course, the title is very ambitious: how can we halt the diversity and disappearance of vegetable and animal species by 2010 and beyond? How we would so very much like to think this possible! However, we know how difficult it is, in the short term, to set to music the various European and multilateral instruments for which we are writing the score every day in this House. At a time when the citizens' and the media's attention is focused on climate change, we need to highlight the importance of biodiversity, because there is no better strategy for combating climate change than to promote the dynamic development of ecosystems: Commissioner Borg made this point very effectively a few moments ago. As you will have gathered, biodiversity requires a dynamic approach, and when we reason about in situ 
biodiversity in Europe, we are talking about the preservation of vegetable and animal species from territories that are managed and planned as close to the local populations as possible. Accordingly, the political will and governmental capacity to open a dialogue are imperative when it comes to developing and supporting special environmental networks, such as Natura 2000. On the other hand, ex situ
 management of biodiversity refers more to the practice of conserving animal and vegetable species. Above and beyond the collections – the dusty collections, I would say – in our museums, ex situ
 conservation, as we conceive of it today, means, of course, avoiding the worst by conserving genetic material in agricultural centres: it is being put in a safe place, allegedly. For my part, however, I wonder about the funding of the advisory groups for international agricultural research and about the way in which they operate, as they must integrate local and indigenous communities. To conclude, I should like to stress, of course, how important it is for our populations and our territories that European regulations are implemented properly, because we know that everything is connected and, for example, the water framework directive must be applied. As far as biodiversity is concerned, water is a medium that makes ecosystems dynamic right from the start. Thus, instead of referring to a vague notion of ‘good ecological status’, it is crucial that we ensure that freshwaters do not deteriorate.

Madam President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, we have come to the end of a particularly long journey, and, in order to conclude this conciliation on the financial instrument for the environment (Life+), I should like first of all to thank my fellow shadow rapporteurs: Mrs Gutiérrez-Cortines, Mrs Ries and Mrs Lienemann. I believe that, without them, the conciliation could not have been brought to a successful conclusion because, I must point out, if we have obtained entirely positive results, it is because we defended a strong position within the European Parliament and because, together, we stood up, I would say, to the Commission and to the Council on several points. I should like also to thank Parliament's services and the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Food Safety. I am grateful also to the Commission and to Commissioner Dimas, in particular. I wish him a speedy recovery. I know that he cannot be with us this evening, but I thank him, as well as his services, for having helped us to carry this conciliation through to a successful conclusion. I should like, finally, to thank the Council, even though it is not present this evening. I believe that we can thank Mr Gabriel and the Council representatives who helped make a success of the conciliation because I recall that, on the evening of the conciliation, we had the impression at times that facing us were ministers for the budget rather than ministers for the environment. Indeed, as MEPs, we were defending a solid budget for the ministers of the environment, while they were giving the impression that they did not really want it. To conclude the list of thanks, I should like to thank Mrs Kratsa-Tsagaropoulou, who chaired Parliament's delegation at the conciliation, together with the chairman of our Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Food Safety, Mr Ouzký. With your permission, I shall remind you of one or two things. We are at the stage of third reading and, therefore, of conciliation. I would remind you that the work on this Life+ report began at the same time as the examination of the financial perspective, since we felt that a Life+ budget – which comes under the financial package for the environment for the next seven years – could not be established outside the financial perspective. That is why we forced the committee responsible for the financial perspective and Mr Böge in particular, since we felt that the environment budget for the next seven years was nothing but a meagre budget and that it needed to be increased. We wanted to increase it to the figure mooted by the Commission. Thus, by integrating, for example, the management of Natura 2000, we should have increased the Life+ budget by EUR 21 billion. We knew full well that that was an absolutely enormous sum and that the resources did not allow it, but we had banked on that strategy in order to show that, in actual fact, there was no budgetary heading specifically devoted to Natura 2000 in the EU budget. That was our strategy at first reading, and it won us virtually unanimous support. Yet, of course, at the stage of the common position, we were not really heard. The rapporteur for the budget, Mr Böge, did us a good turn by agreeing to grant EUR 100 million. One hundred million euros for Life+ is a derisory sum given the needs that we have, given the needs that we make so much of when faced with our fellow citizens: the fight against climate change, the fight against the loss of biodiversity, the decontamination of our soil, the purification of our rivers, the fight to save our groundwater, and so on. I shall stop there. The fact remains that those EUR 100 million were of course welcome, because we take everything that there is to take, but to our great surprise – and this is what made us angry – of the EUR 100 million that had been allocated to us, EUR 50 million had disappeared, had been allocated to the general budget. That made us very angry, but what made us angrier still was the fact that the sharing out of budget-related management activities was totally unacceptable to us, as the European Parliament. We believed, and still believe, that environmental protection must be managed at European level: this is a policy that is a positive point for the European Parliament, a positive policy, with which our fellow citizens identify. This policy therefore needed to remain at European level, and the strategy implemented by the Council and the Commission at second reading allocated 80% of the management of the budget to the Member States. We were unable to accept this kind of re-nationalisation of European policies. That is why our aim was to ensure that the Council agreed to keep the management of the environment budget in the hands of the Commission. I believe that we have been truly successful since, during conciliation, the Council did in fact agree to several things: that the management of the EU budget be centralised, that is to say, that it be managed at European level; that the Commission double its resources for the management of the environment, that is to say, that there be an increase from 1% to 2%; that 50% of the budget be allocated to biodiversity and to environmental protection; and, finally, that it be possible for the 2007 budget to be applied this year and for NGOs to obtain financial resources starting this year. I therefore believe that we have done some very good work, Madam President, and, once again, I am grateful to everyone, to the Council and to the Commission, for having been able to conclude this conciliation, and for having done so, I might add, along the lines proposed by Parliament, for the good of our fellow citizens, because we are here to represent our fellow citizens.

Mr President, Commissioner, the annual strategy proposed by the European Commission for the 2008 budgetary procedure must strictly execute the decisions of the legislature. It must not tone them down. Despite current events being dominated by climate change – I am referring to the Stern report and the IPCC conclusions – the Commission proposal waters down the concept of sustainable development. It merely mentions the prosperity, solidarity, security and external influence headings, the content of which remains arbitrary. One may recall at this point, Commissioner, our struggle to obtain, at the time of the financial perspective, a EUR 100 million boost for the protection of the environment, which the Commission immediately halved. Whereas it was so difficult to obtain funds for the environmental programme, I note how easy it was to release additional resources to fund the Frontex agency as an instrument for combating illegal immigration. These budget signals illustrate the extent to which our flexibility is limited by the financial perspective and demonstrate, once again, that the environment budget is being whittled away. Despite the urgency and importance of the environment for our fellow citizens, this is a cruelly limited budget for tackling the challenges of the fight against climate change and the erosion of biodiversity. Let us not forget that the Natura 2000 network should receive EUR 6 billion each year in order to function properly. Despite these shortcomings, I should like to express my interest in the new European Commission initiatives under the ‘external influence’ heading. The fund for renewable energy and energy efficiency and the global alliance on climate change must help the ACP countries, and Africa in particular, to embark on a form of development that integrates the environmental pillar and the social pillar more boldly than we have done, and thus to promote the concept of sustainable development. Turning to a different subject, the Group of the Greens/European Free Alliance is looking forward to the Commission report on medium-term staffing requirements. Commissioner, our group has always been in favour of having a satisfactory and steady supply of human resources. In the case of the executive agencies, we need to examine on a case-by-case basis whether programmes are carried out better with an executive agency, or whether we need to keep a centralised approach, as the European Parliament has demanded for LIFE+.

 Mr President, I wish to thank the Commissioner and the representative of the Council for being here today. The time has come for the Union to take action, as the situation in Guinea is sliding downhill. Guinea has for too long been deliberately kept in a state of underdevelopment by the dictatorial regime and is becoming mired in a tragic deadlock for lack of transparency and democracy. The people of Guinea have had enough of poverty, destitution and social injustice; they have not enjoyed the benefits of Guinea’s riches – the country has an abundance of natural resources – which are monopolised and mismanaged by the President and his cronies, who are as guilty as he is. President Conté, who has been in power since 1984, is ill, and is clinging to life as he is clinging to power. If he survives, no one will begrudge him his health. If, on the other hand, he remains in power and re-establishes a state of emergency. We will neither understand nor accept this. After decades of undiluted power, one has no choice but to condemn such an attitude when wisdom, or a modicum of compassion for his people, would surely have led the President to prepare for the smooth transfer of power to his successor and for the transition to a genuinely democratic regime. Instead of that, a state of siege has been declared, the right to assembly and freedom of movement have been curtailed, and the military have violently broken up peaceful demonstrations and killed people. This is unacceptable. We have no choice but to condemn this brutality, this lack of respect for the most basic human rights of the people of Guinea and the shameful behaviour of a leader who is at the end of his reign but whose capacity for causing suffering is sadly not at an end. We must demand that a committee of inquiry be set up to look into the events in Guinea in order to ascertain the full extent of the repression and the level of the hierarchy at which decisions have been taken and by whom. Furthermore, will the EU demand political dialogue, as laid down in Article 96 of the Cotonou Agreement? We must keep a very close eye on the situation, because, if it were to continue to worsen, not only would the people of Guinea suffer but so too could the whole of that region of Africa, as the deepening internal conflict would spread to neighbouring countries. The past is sadly all too full of such examples.

Madam President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, every day, we produce household, industrial and mining waste, which is very difficult to destroy. Waste management is complex and raises the question – implicitly, of course – of our ability to respect not only the environment and people’s health, but also our own European policies. Since 1976, we have been developing fairly ineffective common legislation. This second directive, which is a revision of the ‘Waste’ Directive, cannot hide behind the existing provisions, which have just been made simpler. The figures speak for themselves. Volumes of waste continue to increase: 3.5 tonnes are produced per inhabitant per year, which equates to an increase of 460 kg in ten years. Over and above legislation that can be converted into future provisions, it is important to give Europeans an overall view of the route travelled by our bins. The European hierarchy, founded on five key principles – prevention, sorting, recycling, incineration and disposal – must not be undermined by efforts to promote incineration. Like many citizens living near incineration plants, I am concerned that the Union is not showing itself to be more proactive in terms of waste prevention and recycling, by putting in place genuine sectors for recycling, for example. We must drastically reduce our use of incineration and prevent it from being granted the status of an energy recovery process. On the contrary, it is important to develop recycling, so that we attain a rate of 50% of waste managed by local authorities and of 60% of other waste being recycled by 2020, with a gradual reduction in the burying and incineration of all materials that can be re-used, recycled or composted. I would also draw your attention, Madam President, to the inclusion of the ‘Hazardous waste’ Directive in the new legislation. Hazardous waste must be strictly controlled; it must come under a traceability system and an extremely restrictive authorisation system. We agree on the need to prevent and reduce the impact of waste, Commissioner, but succumbing to the easy option of incineration would be unacceptable.

I too would like to congratulate our new President of the sitting: welcome, Mr President! Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, the fight against climate change requires a considerable commitment on the part of the Union in favour of public transport, and of the railways in particular. In my region, Lorraine, a recent tragic cross-border accident, resulting from a signalling error, dramatically illustrated the urgent need to harmonise the rail network, which is no small challenge. Because it involves the concepts of access to a public service and of land management, achieving uniformity requires the greatest possible prudence, as the Minster acknowledged just now. I do not therefore believe that the liberalisation proposed in Mr Jarzembowski’s report is the right approach. Apart from the fact that opening up to competition will jeopardise the Member States’ public service duties, it will not ultimately lead to fare reductions for our users. Citizens travelling to work on a daily basis will not see any improvements to their travelling conditions either. Quite the contrary! Opening up to competition will lead to a deterioration of secondary lines, which are so important to local development. And what about the impact of liberalisation on rail safety, Commissioner? The transfer from the roads to rail is essential, and it is essential that Europe implements that. I shall end with a nod to the Minister, who is not present: I would like to say that yesterday’s utopias are today’s realities.

 Mr President, with REACH, together we, including Mr Sacconi, our rapporteur, have raised tremendous hopes that our environment can be rid of the persistent, bio-accumulative and toxic chemical substances that are poisoning our health and the natural environment. The plan to regulate chemical products awakened environmental and social consciences in Europe and even beyond our borders. As a result, the massive amount of dialogue with civil society – trade unions, NGOs, undertakings and manufacturers – will have brought some agreement on the necessity of improving public health and the quality of the environment and of providing the public and workers with information on the chemical products that surround us. Sadly, despite an encouraging message from the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Food Safety, the current compromises will weaken this REACH project. How can we explain to our fellow citizens that we will not be holding manufacturers responsible for spreading toxic substances, but that it will be consumers and workers who handle dangerous substances who will have to bear that responsibility? How are we to explain that Parliament advocates the substitution of carcinogenic and mutagenic molecules and endocrine disruptors but is not making it a systematic requirement? And what are we to say about the lack of transparency of the information on the most dangerous substances? We find that unacceptable and incomprehensible. Even if many small and medium-sized industries and enterprises have taken on board the added value of green chemicals, the heavyweights of the European chemical industry are refusing to change. They continue to influence our work despite the financial burden on our health system of the growth in pathologies, which Mr Nassauer, incidentally, completely overlooks. A great responsibility rests on us today and we must vote accordingly. The Greens’ amendments will strengthen REACH, make it meaningful and prevent it delaying the substitution of the most dangerous products indefinitely; Mr Sacconi recognises this. Finally, I will say that this compromise may be a great step for the chemical industry, but it will remain a climb-down for our Parliament.

 Mr President, not long ago we were applauding the peaceful revolution in Georgia and encouraging its young leaders to establish true democracy in their country. Today, as we know, Georgia is experiencing difficulties in resolving conflicts with its separatist regions, and the escalating provocations from both sides are certainly not helping to resolve those conflicts peacefully. What is worse, armed intervention could embroil the entire Caucasus, which is something of which we are all conscious. That is why we must strongly urge the Georgian authorities to take a conciliatory approach and to constructively relaunch the peace process in South Ossetia. However, there are extenuating circumstances in Georgia: its neighbour, Russia, is not playing the conciliation game. For example, when, in Lahti last week, he compared South Ossetia to Kosovo, Mr Putin was adding fuel to the flames in the Caucasus, at the very time when he was expected to re-establish trust by normalising relations with his neighbours in Georgia. Whatever Russia may say, it certainly is involved in this conflict. Did it not issue Russian passports to the Georgian population of South Ossetia? How valid can a referendum be if 80% of the participants were Russian citizens? How neutral can we expect the peace-keeping forces in South Ossetia to be when they are predominantly Russian? I will not even mention the unilateral Russian embargo or the ongoing deportations of Georgians in Russia, which are evidence of a desire to destabilise Georgia. So, then, the neighbourhood policy and greater cooperation with Russia are, of course, tools for us, but you will forgive me if I cannot share the Council's position on the replacement of the peace-keeping forces. I think, ladies and gentlemen, that we really do need to ask ourselves how the neutrality and impartiality of these forces can be guaranteed. We should perhaps – or should I say, definitely – be prepared to make a contribution, should it prove necessary, to the replacement of the peace-keeping forces. (The President cut off the speaker)

Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, I must begin by thanking the members of the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Food Safety and, in particular, my fellow shadow rapporteurs for the work that we have done together, because I believe that it can be said - even though, as is customary at this hour, the Chamber is not very full - that we have genuinely carried out a joint piece of work and that this report, which bears my name, could just as well bear the name of my fellow Members, Mrs Gutiérrez-Cortines, Mrs Ries or even Mrs Lienemann, who apologises for not being able to take part in this evening’s debate. We have also produced a joint piece of work with the Commission. Unfortunately, it is regrettable that the Council is not present, because, ultimately, our results will depend greatly on it. I am entirely convinced that the cooperation that we have been able to put in place during this first reading and that follows on from the common position will enable us to reach a consensus with the Council and with yourself, and I am counting on you, Commissioner, to pass the results of this debate on to the Council. Indeed, ladies and gentlemen, LIFE+ is no longer the programme that we once knew, but will indeed constitute the Union’s ‘environment’ budget heading. Thus, it is LIFE+ that will govern Europe’s innovative policies, that will rise to the challenges, such as the fight against climate change and the efforts to rid the air and soil of pollution, that will prevent biodiversity damage and that will provide the Environment DG and the NGOs, our bio-indicators par excellence
, with the means to endow the Member States’ environmental policies with European added value. In fact, as you will know, ladies and gentlemen, we are talking here about an ‘impossible budget heading’, given the derisory sum that the Council and the Commission have granted it. We made an attempt, at first reading, to increase this LIFE heading, which, I must point out, does not even represent 1% of the overall budget, with the aim of bringing it into line with the policies much-publicised by the Union itself. The debate focused back then on support for the Natura 2000 network, our flagship environmental policy. By adding EUR 21 billion, which even the Commission felt was necessary if Natura 2000 was to be managed properly, the European Parliament sent out a strong signal to the Commission and to the Council. We were right to do so. Today, with the reduction in the Structural Funds budgets, a form of unbridled competition has begun in the regions, and all of our colleagues are having a change of heart. As Natura 2000 does not specifically feature in the financial regulations, well, it will undoubtedly be environmental volunteers who produce the results. We should not get our hopes up too much, however, regarding the share that will be reserved for the protection of nature and biodiversity, despite the fact that, at the European Parliament’s first reading, we were virtually unanimous in our support of an ambitious European policy. The common position proposed to us has spectacularly ignored our warning. Worse still, it is deviating from it in an alarming way, going so far as to grant 80% of the delegated management responsibility to the Member States, even though you did not mention this percentage in your initial proposal. What minister would refuse such a gift? Admittedly, we also realise that, with too few staff members, the Commission is afraid of managing multiple projects. This is made all the more difficult by the fact that, with a reduction in the number of European officials having been announced, there remains little hope of the Environment DG strengthening its staff. Let us make it very clear to you: this approach is not the right one because the European level remains the most relevant and most secure one for dealing with environmental issues. We even feel that this handover of power from the Commission to the Member States is dangerous. In our view, this initial strategy to renationalise the environmental policies is the sign of a slow disintegration of the European idea. Each Member State demanding its initial bet would thus be free to dip into the Lisbon Strategy, and thus to become an unrivalled competitor – and we know full well that competition generally goes hand in hand with environmental damage – or to claim that sustainable development, which requires a global approach, is the opposite of such competition. We also know the extent to which the label ‘environment' serves to justify problems that destroy the environment. Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, this is the trap that we refuse to fall into because to do so would be to negate all of the successes that Europe has had in relation to the environment. If there is one policy that can be seen, identified, recognised and appreciated by Europeans, it is indeed the one that we have succeeded in implementing on environmental protection. We all know that LIFE must enable us to deal with emergencies and to implement policies aimed at restoring our environment. The EUR 100 million that were extracted at the time of the financial perspective and that we are demanding, Commissioner, be allocated entirely to the environment will not be enough to achieve these aims. Commissioner, unless you are a magician, it will be impossible for you to keep your promises with such derisory sums. Entrusting them to the Member States therefore means running the risk of failure. Our ambition is for the Union to remain the flagship, the global leader that takes the initiative for establishing laws to protect the planet. That requires the Commission to be able to produce ambitious policies, to assume responsibility and control of the quality of the projects launched at Member State level and to reject any that are unsuitable. European policy must under no circumstances compensate for the Member States’ failings in relation to the environment, and, as you will understand, we are refusing to give them a blank cheque. On the other hand, we are perfectly aware that the delay that this procedure could cause is also liable to cause delays in terms of funding. That is why, together, we have tabled the same amendment, so as to ensure that the work done by your Environment DG continues to be funded, pending an agreement, of course. Above all, we also want it to be possible for this work to continue and even for you to launch new projects and oversee the funding of the work done by NGOs. We should like to make it clear in this House that, legally and financially, that is possible. To conclude, Mr President, I would say that the ball is now in the court of the Council and of the Commission and that we are convinced that we are going to reach an agreement amongst ourselves precisely so as to ensure that this ambitious environmental policy is taken forward. That is what our fellow citizens expect, and they encourage you in that regard.

Mr President, one event chases away another. Nonetheless we are now witnessing live the escalation of violations of the rules of international law perpetrated by Russia against Georgia: the granting of Russian citizenship to the people of South Ossetia and Abkhazia, the rejection of the peace plan proposed by Georgia to settle the conflicts with the separatist regions and the closure of the two border crossing points. Tension has further increased following the arrest of Russian spies by Georgia, with reprisals from Moscow which has hunted down Georgians and is trying to economically strangle its neighbour by unilaterally introducing sanctions blocking trade between Russia and Georgia. Finally, by giving the impression that Russia would recognise the separatist regions, South Ossetia and Abkhazia, if Kosovo gained its independence, Mr Putin makes the resolution of the conflict even more remote. The list is long and the Georgians are utterly exasperated. Faced with this situation on the brink of explosion, the European Union has a crucial role to play in bringing the sides, and especially Russia on the occasion of European Union/Russia negotiations, to the negotiating table to find a solution and put an end to this latent conflict in the Southern Caucasus. The Neighbourhood Policy allows us this; military action would be a total failure of our policies.

Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, if we want to combat air pollution effectively and to get results in the area of health, then we have to adopt far more ambitious drafts in this House. The poor excuse about certain Member States encountering difficulties in implementing environmental legislation is no longer acceptable, because people’s health is no longer a matter for negotiation. The cost of diseases caused by air pollution is rising on a daily basis. The fact is that it is the authorities that are currently picking up the bill for health care, as the cost of this is not yet integrated into our budgets. What is more, economists estimate that the price of a gallon of oil, which currently stands at USD 3, will have to be increased to USD 10 in order to integrate the cost of health care and climate change. That is what would profoundly change the situation. The Union must not grow weak, Commissioner, on environmental policy, as its cunning game of simplifying and merging the European legal texts would suggest that it has a tendency to do. That is why the Group of the Greens/European Free Alliance is calling for more binding approaches, particularly in relation to PM 2.5, and for the abolition of the derogations. The threat of an environmental disaster that hangs over us, ladies and gentlemen, requires drastic measures, and an example of this comes for once from the United States, where the State of California has provided food for thought by lodging a complaint against the largest car manufacturers for damage to the environment and public health. Finally, I would like to say a few words to our dear friend, Mr Sjöstedt. I believe that we are going to miss your perspective on matters at the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Food Safety, but we wish you well on the other side of the border, on the other side of the European Union. Take along with you, too, the message about protecting nature. Thank you.

 Some governments worry about vehicle tax; others worry about maintaining a taxation system full of irregularities. As regards this draft directive, I would like to emphasise the importance of encouraging a proactive approach. Is it necessary to debate the constricting measures to be adopted in order to slow down climate change? To make progress, what is needed is to sweep aside the reluctance of the car and petrol lobbies. Environmental tax is a means to help both citizens and the planet itself. If implemented correctly, it will encourage innovation in the transport sectors and it will promote energy economies. We must also stop the paralysis of our governments. Taxation cannot be the only solution. We must also develop regulations to reduce greenhouse gases. It is essential to make citizens responsible and to develop tools to evaluate our effect on the environment. The Greens have voted for this project as the first step towards a CO2 tax. This could lead to the construction of an environmental taxation system on a sufficient scale to meet the challenges we face. The Greens want registration tax to be maintained. In Denmark, it has led to the reduction of the car park. The Greens remain sceptical about ‘budget neutrality’ and fear other impositions. We regret that the European Parliament has not followed the Greens’ amendments requiring Member States to reduce their transport-related CO2 emissions.

Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, despite being an ACP member state, Mauritania is one of the world’s forgotten countries. For too long, the countries of Europe turned a blind eye to the dictatorship of President Ould Taya, who imprisoned, tortured and banished opponents of his regime. Parliament and the European institutions remained silent when we submitted a request for an observation mission to be dispatched during the 2003 presidential elections, even though some candidates were being held in prison. The Union was overcautious following the events of 3 August 2005, which brought down the dictator, without a single drop of blood being shed, even though we knew that the country was on the verge of exploding. I am pleased that I organised the first discussion platform in 2004 at the European Parliament, gathering together, on neutral ground, Mauritanians from civil society, political parties and official representatives in an effort to pave the way for democracy. We are paying tribute today to the Union, which supports the democratic process on which Mauritania has embarked, on the basis of a public consensus behind the Military Council for Justice and Democracy. Pledges have already been made by this transitional authority, with the creation of an independent national electoral commission, with the abolition of media censorship and with the organisation of a referendum, on 25 June 2005, the smooth running of which was hailed by international observers. I am also pleased that the Union has committed itself to sending a long-term observation mission to monitor the elections taking place this November, thus ensuring that every Mauritanian citizen can exercise his or her voting rights. Finally, the revenue from oil exploitation must be used for education, health care and the development of the peoples of Mauritania. The exploitation of oil, which will not last forever, must not be done in a manner that is detrimental to marine and coastal biodiversity, but must protect the Banc d’Argouin, for example, from all forms of pollution and ensure that the fishery resource, which is so important to the people of Mauritania, is managed in a sustainable way. I am pleased that the authorities, together with the Union, have embarked on a more open debate on the fishing agreements with a view to reaching a fair agreement. The ban on factory ships such as the ‘Atlantic Dawn', for example, is a prerequisite for reaching such an agreement. Finally – and here I conclude - the anti-immigration cooperation project must help to create jobs in Mauritania and to give migrants a reception that is worthy of the values espoused in Europe.

Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, France stirred up a wave of indignation when it classified the shipment of radioactive waste as an official secret. It was thus denying local elected representatives and local communities the right to be informed of the fact that trains containing highly dangerous radioactive material were travelling across their land. As recently as 16 May 2006, a member of French civil society was kept in police custody because he was in possession of an impact study concerning the EPR project's ability to withstand a disaster involving the loss of an airliner also classified as an official secret. By adopting, with vague words, the French idea that 'information regarding shipments (…) is handled with due care and protected against any misuse’, Parliament’s Committee on Industry, Research and Energy is in fact proposing to institutionalise official secrets at European level. Is the European Parliament, the all-round world champion in promoting and demanding transparency and democratic control on the international stage, going to go back on what it has said and done and make an exception of the nuclear issue? Our Parliament would lose a great deal of credibility if it were to make obscurantism the rule where highly radioactive waste is concerned. We know that burying is not the solution when it comes to managing nuclear waste. That is why we reject the plan to build a European nuclear dump in Bure, in my region, or anywhere else. Furthermore, going along with the proposal to delegate the management of nuclear waste to third countries – Ukraine or Russia for instance – is irresponsible. The idea is ethically and morally reprehensible when it comes to nuclear waste which, let us not forget, must be monitored forever. In the meantime, the acceptable solution – and this is the response that I wish to give to my fellow Members from the Group of the European People's Party (Christian Democrats) and European Democrats - consists in storing the waste within nuclear power stations. That is the only place in which it is secure, and that is without mentioning the fact that this move would stop the process whereby waste is toured the length and breadth of Europe by road or rail. Finally, the question is: how long will Europeans have to wait for transparency of information to be applied to the nuclear sector?

Mr President, Mr President-in-Office of the Council, Commissioner, we all know that it is no longer a time for lamenting the consequences of our mistakes. The world ecological crisis is hitting us full in the face and I will not list the problems arising within this context. We here are well aware, more than anyone else I am sure, how urgent it is to act and to make courageous and wide-ranging political choices. And what are we seeing, since this is what is important? That the Commission and the Member States use and abuse the rhetoric on sustainable development, sometimes cynically, to justify non-sustainable policies. I shall take the example of biodiversity, the common theme of our very survival, as you know very well, Mr Pröll. Since we have waged a real battle here to obtain budgets for biodiversity in the financial perspective, since we have said that the Natura 2000 programme would be taken into account in the Structural Funds, an argument used to justify not creating a new budget line, could you tell us – and this question is for the Commission, which is not listening – why biodiversity has not been included amongst the priorities of FEDER and why biodiversity has not been provided with any budgetary contribution? I would therefore really like to know who is sabotaging sustainable development in these institutions? And if there is sabotage, how much faith can we have in the strategy that you are presenting to us?

in August, given that it proposed to dispatch a European Union delegation for the purposes of monitoring the elections being held there.

Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, for a long time now, we have been subsidising a development in the agricultural, industrial and transport fields that has damaged the environment and brought about the alarming situation that we are currently experiencing, and we are paying the price for it: natural disasters are the witnesses to those mistakes. It is now a matter of facing up to the damage caused by those disasters, and we all agree on the need to support the victims and to help them get back on their feet and rebuild their lives after the disasters, as well as the need to support the ‘Disaster' fund in order to show solidarity with all of the victims and to demonstrate that the European Parliament takes an interest in, and cares about, its fellow citizens. However, on behalf of the Group of the Greens/European Free Alliance, we also call for investment in the areas of prevention and restoration, instead of the focus being merely on curing the ills. Even though we broadly support the analyses of the proposals drafted in various resolutions tabled, in particular, by the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Food Safety and by the Committee on Regional Development, I am disappointed by the proposal of the Committee on Agriculture and Rural Development, which is refusing, as it were, to assume its share of the responsibility for the speed with which these phenomena are occurring. What shocks me is the fact that the Committee on Agriculture and Rural Development is requesting that the aid not be deducted from the CAP resources. We have just spent a year witnessing a significant struggle aimed at obtaining a fund to preserve the biodiversity falling under Natura 2000, and we have failed. Yesterday, we all took note of that failure. As rapporteur for Life +, I will be unable to agree to this programme – which is already well and truly dwindling away – serving as an insurance policy for disasters that are less and less the result of nature. Ladies and gentlemen, it is in reality our cultivation methods that we must change. The flooding of the Danube can be mentioned by way of example. The dams had to be knocked down because the Danube delta, which is prone to flooding, had virtually dried up. We now need to pose this crucial question: what kind of agriculture and what kinds of transport do we hope to have in the future if the Kyoto Protocol is regarded as the key element where climate change and the fight against this change are concerned? We must seek out the causes of these disruptions, and we, as Members of the European Parliament, know what they are: they are changes in modes of transport. I am in favour of a Solidarity Fund and of giving aid to the victims, but let us genuinely seek out the causes, otherwise we are just going to make changes to a never-ending problem.

 Madam President, with its various financial instruments, is the EU providing itself with the means to pursue its external policies sincerely and in full? If Europe disappoints, euroscepticism will increase. If we disappoint our partners, we are taking the risk that they will turn away from us. I hope that the neighbourhood instrument will be effective and will bring the regional stability for which we hope. In bringing the countries of the southern Caucasus into the neighbourhood policy, for example, has the Union taken account of the expectations of the people concerned? I am talking about a sub-region that I know well. Bordered by Russia, Turkey and Iran, it is now at the centre of European and international debate. By guaranteeing their security, we are also guaranteeing our own. For this to work, our neighbours need considerable resources to implement the action plans they are currently drawing up, and it is regrettable that the European Union and Parliament are not involved in the negotiations. However, the important thing is that this instrument, the neighbourhood policy, must assist these countries on the path to democracy, that the Union must be a real player in the peaceful resolution of conflicts, namely, in the case of the southern Caucasus, the 'frozen' conflicts in Nagorno-Karabakh and Abkhazia, and in the peace plans for South Ossetia. These countries have voluntarily turned towards our European values, and they must be supported in their action plans. Because we now need to do more and better with the available resources – which seems to be the theme for today – I therefore call on the Commission to get the allocation of the scarce resources right and to invest in projects based on the fundamental principles of lasting peace and regional stability, respect for human rights and democracy, and sustainable development.

Mr President, the protection of biodiversity is a fascinating subject. My group, the Group of the Greens/European Free Alliance, is completely satisfied with the resolution that was approved by a very, very large majority of the European Parliament and it is completely satisfied also that Parliament is sending to the eighth Conference on biodiversity, three years after Kuala Lumpur, a delegation that will defend the protection of biodiversity. With this in view, ladies and gentlemen, I should like to remind you of some basic principles that are all too often forgotten here in this Parliament. Food safety depends on three things: water, soil and phytogenetic diversity, and only 12 plant varieties, including wheat, rice, maize and potatoes provide virtually 80% of the energy requirements of the world’s population. It is a great temptation, therefore, for industry to acquire the monopoly on seeds by making use of technologies derived from biotechnology. Consequently, we call on the Council of the European Union, which will be present, to support the moratorium that is currently in place on trials and commercialisation of genetically modified varieties in order to restrict their use. Put more simply, ladies and gentlemen, the Terminator must not re-emerge in the guise of some biotechnological innovation. Furthermore, in order to limit the invasive nature, for our ecosystems, of varieties of biotechnological origin, biological diversity must be protected by protocols that force researchers to carry out their experiments in confined areas. In conclusion, we must remember that the fight against the erosion of biodiversity presupposes some action on conservation. Of course, it is not a matter of putting away biodiversity in test tubes, but rather of allowing indigenous populations, which, moreover, we support, to continue to make use of their traditional expertise and of their supremacy over genetic resources. It has to be recognised that here too, money is the sinews of war. I shall therefore be asking you also to support the Global Environment Facility. We know very well that, in the case of Natura 2000, if the European Union does not allocate money to this network, biodiversity will not be protected. In the same way, if we do not give money to the Global Environment Facility, nature conservation will be, once again, nothing more than a tissue of fine words spoken in plenary.

 Mr President, it is vital to remember the importance of the EU's commitment in the southern Caucasus, which is still wracked by frozen conflicts, but is highly strategic and resolutely European. We are aware that Mrs Ferrero-Waldner is currently on an official visit to the region, but I would particularly like to launch an appeal to parliamentarians and an appeal to responsibility. At a time when the European Union is negotiating action plans with each of the countries to promote the stability of the region, Armenia and Azerbaijan have entered a delicate, but hopeful, phase of peace negotiations regarding the conflict in Nagorno-Karabakh. Presidents Aliev and Kocharian met last Sunday at Rambouillet, under the aegis of the OSCE Minsk group. The success of the process is the top priority, because it could indirectly lead to a resolution to the other conflicts in the region. It is thus a vital precondition to the general stabilisation of the region. In this context, ladies and gentlemen, do you really think, in your heart of hearts, that now is the time to throw oil on the fire by deleting, as the amendments propose, the sections that quite rightly allow a balanced approach to the joint resolution that we all negotiated together the day before yesterday? We have already condemned the destruction of the cemetery in Julfa, in Mr Tannock's report from January, and we continue to condemn it. However, ladies and gentlemen, we cannot leave out the global context of the frozen conflict between Armenia and Azerbaijan, which has been responsible for thousands of deaths and refugees; the wounds are still raw. Can we also ignore the fact that 20% of Azerbaijan's territory is considered by Armenia to be a buffer zone for Nagorno-Karabakh and that various elements of the cultural and religious heritage of these occupied territories have also been destroyed? It is high time to stop this dangerous escalation. It would be irresponsible to deny the shared responsibility of the parties to a conflict and to refer only to the destruction caused by one side, and it would also be contrary to our commitment to support our Armenian and Azerbaijani friends in the desire to resolve their differences. Finally, this resolution comes at a time of increased tensions between the Muslim world and the western world. A weak text could reduce these events to a simple clash between the Christian and Muslim worlds. I therefore ask you not to give arguments to the extremists of all sides by voting for a resolution which, if it were amended in line with certain proposals, would be unfairly partisan. It is a question of personal conscience, but it is also the credibility of the European Parliament and, more broadly, the activities of the European Union in the region that are at stake.

 Mr President, Commissioner, I am grateful to Mr Tannock, who took up the torch on this report, for his availability and his willingness to listen with regard to the very complex issues that arise when defining the neighbourhood policy. The neighbourhood policy became a necessity with the arrival of the new Member States and, in involving all the bordering countries to the East around the Mediterranean, it has become one of the key elements and strong points in the EU's external policy. For this action, the Union has taken on a considerable responsibility and it will have a tough job to avoid dashing the hopes of our neighbours. Indeed, a new dynamism has been born in these countries, which now expect that the Union will support them in the process of democratisation, stabilisation and sustainable development that they have launched. In some countries, it is even a prerequisite for future accession. We therefore have to avoid a number of pitfalls if we are to make a success of the neighbourhood policy. It must include a multilateral dimension and provide an institutional framework within which the partner countries are fully involved in defining European policy. It must not be limited simply to a free trade area but be based on a real sharing of common values, democracy and human rights. The neighbourhood policy must work to consolidate civil society by setting up a civil forum where NGOs can follow the action plans, which, Commissioner, will not be cooperation plans Mark 2 but specific and effective plans, with a Union determined to monitor them and implement them according to specific criteria. It is with a certain amount of pride, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, that I will support the action plans for the countries of the southern Caucasus, because the fact that Armenia, Azerbaijan and Georgia are part of this neighbourhood policy is thanks to us in the European Parliament and not to the Commission and the Council. Today, these three former Soviet republics bear a heavy burden of history. The neighbourhood policy should help them to find an answer to their frozen conflicts. The issue of Nagorno-Karabakh must be dealt with; the refugees – particularly the Azerbaijanis – must be able to go home; the destruction of historic Armenian monuments in Nakhichevan is unacceptable; Turkey must reopen its border with Armenia; Russia cannot, on the one hand, have a privileged partnership with the EU and, on the other hand, issue passports to Georgian separatists; and the EU must support the peace plan in Georgia for South Ossetia and help to draw up a plan for Abkhazia. As you can see, strong involvement from the EU, via the drafting of a stability pact in the southern Caucasus to achieve a peaceful resolution to these conflicts, is absolutely vital and will be a win-win strategy. It will help these countries to find the path to development and lasting peace and it will bring the EU considerable credit in a region dominated by the influence of Russia and the United States. Let us make the neighbourhood policy the spearhead of a successful common global security policy.

Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, who would dare announce today the slashing of 170 000 jobs in the countries long established in our Union?. Is this madness? An aberration? No, this is simply what is taking place. In actual fact, if the ECOFIN Council on 6 December does not extend the reduced VAT rate, this catastrophic situation will begin in 2006. The implementation in 1999 of the experiment of reduced VAT rates for labour-intensive services has proved its effectiveness. It has created jobs. In France, for example, the BTP (public buildings and works sector) estimates that 60 000 long-term jobs have been created. The experiment has also contributed to combating illegal work. Still on the subject of France, the number of offences committed in the construction sector has been halved. Furthermore, this measure is beneficial in combating global warming. Applying reduced VAT rates in the context of energy saving work would benefit consumers and businesses alike and represents a potential source of jobs that cannot be relocated. What more convincing arguments could the Council therefore present in favour of rejecting the extension of reduced VAT rates? In France, ladies and gentlemen, the people have already expressed their anger towards a Europe that no longer meets their expectations. We therefore genuinely await positive signals from the Council in the future.

 Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, I would also like to congratulate our rapporteur on the perceptiveness she has shown in this matter, and we fully support her proposal to reject the Commission proposal. We can also endorse her arguments. Nevertheless, I would like to stress a few points. First of all, Commissioner, I would like to say that I very much appreciate the preparations you have made in terms of following up this project, in view of the European Parliament’s position. I would like to stress how inconsistent the Commission’s management of this issue of humane trapping has been. We must remember that, in 1998, the European Parliament rejected the conclusion of tripartite agreements with Russia, Canada and the United States, because it felt that they were not ambitious enough to be effective. Unlike today’s events, though, the vote in 1998 was of no consequence, because the Council could have concluded the agreements even against Parliament’s wishes. This time, however, the Commission has proposed a European directive to implement those same agreements, in other words a project that does not achieve the objectives it has set itself. So why, under such circumstances, would Parliament accept such a weak proposal? That is our question to the Commission. With regard to the content, too, we find this proposal unacceptable. Not only has it been criticised by scientists, as my fellow Members have already said, and by animal welfare organisations, but it also does nothing to reduce the suffering of trapped animals. In this connection, I think we must look at the arguments put forward by Mrs Scheele, who explains quite specifically that we are not reducing this suffering at all. One final, vital point: this draft is unacceptable because, at the end of the day, it flouts European law, in that its positive list includes species protected under Article 12 of the Habitat Directive. It includes the otter, the wolf, the beaver and the lynx. And you know, Commissioner – and I am well aware of this, coming from France – how difficult it is to enforce the Habitat Directive, to protect wolves and to try to explain the situation. It is therefore for all these reasons that we are rejecting this proposal and that, in truth, Commissioner, we are counting on you to act as an intermediary between Parliament and the Commission and to get it to withdraw this draft.

 Mr President, we have made a great deal of progress since the launch of the REACH project. We have discovered that we were using more than 100 000 chemical compounds without knowing what effects they have. We have understood that our fellow citizens have been made ill by toxic substances that contribute to our jobs, our comfort and our happiness. About 20 years ago, when toxicological studies first showed that polar bears were contaminated with dioxins, we were shocked and indignant, but, of course, we were not going to stop progress just because of a few polar bears! Today, the medical profession is certain: it is humans, all over the planet, who are intoxicated. Recent studies have shown that we women, as mothers, are passing a toxic heritage on to our children through the umbilical cord. It is the future of the human race that is in danger, whatever some of my fellow Members here today may say. This is a matter of urgency, if we do not want to be responsible for a health disaster attributable to chemicals. The initial REACH project allowed us to meet this challenge. Unfortunately, the blackmail of delocalisation and pressure from industry have poisoned our debates and misrepresented the ambitions of REACH. The rapporteurs’ compromise is an illusion, an imbalance between health and competition, because health is worth much more than high-pressure bargaining, and neither the Commission nor the Council has put a figure on the health costs of a weakened REACH.

 Madam President, Commissioner, first of all I would like to apologise on behalf of my colleague Mrs Beer, who is unfortunately unable to take part in this debate and who would have liked to have been here. As our fellow Members have said, I think that we can be very pleased with the course of the parliamentary elections in Afghanistan on 18 September 2005. Even though there has been some violence in recent months, especially against candidates and tellers, the elections themselves took place in a non-violent atmosphere. That is a good sign for the journey towards democracy and the rule of law in Afghanistan. At present, as Europeans, we need to clarify our commitments on the ground. We support an extension of the ISAF’s mission, because that mission is reconstruction and nation building. This mission is an important one, Commissioner, because it creates a favourable climate for the development of the country following decades of conflict. In this regard, one very important point must be stressed: we must not mix up the two missions, that of the ISAF and that of Operation Enduring Freedom. The latter, which is led by the United States, seeks to combat terrorism, in other words the Taliban. These are combat operations. If we mix up the two reconstruction missions, we will lose the trust of the population and tarnish the good reputation of this mission. Moreover, it will make the situation very difficult for the NGOs, which are currently cooperating with ISAF. We must also raise the issue, as you did, Commissioner, of drugs in the country. We need a plan that takes account of all aspects connected with this problem, which equally affects the agricultural and health sectors and the Afghan economy in general. Of course, this problem also affects neighbouring countries. I would like to make one final important point. The current government of President Karzai has signed contracts for US troops to be stationed in Afghanistan indefinitely. We do not consider this to be a good thing for the stability of the region. Once the nation building has been completed, Afghanistan will be a sovereign state that will have no need for foreign troops.

 Madam President, your proposals do indeed show, Commissioner, that there really is something lacking in Baku. There really is a need for a delegation from the Commission to follow our policies, in order to help Azerbaijan – because it is true that the situation there is not exactly great – and so that, in a few months’ time, we can put this country back on the agenda. Indeed, now more than ever, Azerbaijan is facing its destiny. That country must now show the international community that it can be regarded as a democracy, and that it can follow the rules. Azerbaijan must follow the path of a state under the rule of law. In joining the Council of Europe, Azerbaijan has not only turned towards Europe, but has signed up to its values of democracy and human rights, which bring us all together here. Today, the European Union and Azerbaijan, just like the two neighbouring countries in the Southern Caucasus, are truly forging a joint path, because they are taking part in the new Neighbourhood Policy. As such, they have new rights and obligations. The message that the European Parliament must send to our Azerbaijani friends is clear: if this country wants to become a true democracy, free and transparent elections are a milestone for this. These parliamentary elections, which will be held on 6 November, must take place transparently and according to the rules, with neither pressure nor repression. During the pre-campaign phase and at the moment, however, we have seen an increase in police repression, which is unacceptable. The brutality, violence and intimidation observed against the opposition and their lack of access to the media are unacceptable. In our previous resolution, we called on the two sides, the government majority and the opposition, not to resort to violence, so that the electoral campaign could take place under the best possible conditions. We all had reason to be optimistic at that time, following the presidential decree last May organising these coming elections. We were also optimistic to see the number of candidates registering for the 125 constituencies; even dissidents were allowed to participate! Today, however, as you have said, we cannot fail to notice that, as the elections approach, tensions are mounting and the rules laid down are not being applied at all. By sending a delegation of MEPs to monitor the smooth running of the ballot, the European Parliament is showing its interest and its desire to support the ongoing democratic process in Azerbaijan. Today, we must call on all the parties contesting the election, particularly the majority in power, to demonstrate that this country is able to achieve its ambition: to hold free and transparent elections, in which every citizen, using his single ballot paper, can choose the candidates that will run the country in future. I would remind you – because this is very important, Madam President – that the challenges in Azerbaijan are immense: finding a resolution to the frozen conflict in Nagorny-Karabakh, the increasing power ...

Mr President, ladies and gentlemen from Romania and Bulgaria, I will confine my remarks to the subject of Romania. In mid-July, we received a visit from some particularly anxious Romanian farmers. They explained to us that the Romanian authorities had lost all control over GMO crops. No one, not even their minister, knows how many thousands of hectares are covered by these crops. On the other hand, it turns out that Romania is the country in which GMO crops reign supreme, with soya, maize, plums, potatoes and so on. The directive on GMOs, Commissioner, is categorically not enforced and has been passed over in your report. I have not seen the Rosia Montana gold mine mentioned anywhere in the report either. The present Government, however, took a stand against this project, which violates the very concept of sustainable development, one of the pillars of our European policies. However, Romania also possesses the jewel in Europe’s environmental crown in the shape of the Danube delta. Its approach to managing the delta had succeeded, until now, in striking the right balance between promoting the various activities taking place in the delta and protecting its fabulous biodiversity. However, the way in which the delta is being managed today gives us cause for concern. Thus, the start of the hunting season, on 15 September, is harmful to the preservation of these natural surroundings, and this demonstrates that, as far as the environment is concerned, Romania is really not on the right track. On the other hand, I entirely support Romania’s accession to the European Union but, in doing so, I call on the Romanian authorities to get to grips with the environment and to undertake effectively to protect it.

Mr President, Commissioner, on 28 August, Mr Annan declared: ‘We are all responsible for the famine in Niger.’ Must we do the same? In actual fact, I myself sent a letter to you in April in which I questioned you about the threat of famine in Niger. I also seize this opportunity to thank you for your response. Yet there we have it, we always have to wait to see horrific images on our screens before we intervene. Indeed, only in June, the government of Niger, which has long denied the scale of the crisis, refused the free distribution of emergency food rations, in order, it said, to avoid destabilising the market, when we know full well that the poorest people were unable to obtain and afford these reasonably priced, subsidised food products. We therefore keep coming back to the same question: what are we doing for this dying, declining Africa? Admittedly, the world has finally turned its attention to the fate of Niger. Aid is finally there. The donors realised that this crisis was a real famine, affecting a third of the population of Niger, or 3.6 million people, which is a huge number. What we can still call for in our resolution is for aid reserved for these populations to be equal to demand and, of course, to reach the most vulnerable people without exception. Yet on that subject too, I am not telling you anything you do not already know. I am referring in particular to the nomadic populations, for example, who are not necessarily on the lists of the World Food Programme and who have lost almost all of their livestock, which is itself also dying of hunger. Consequently, a number of suicides have been recorded among the Fulani, a proud people who cannot bear to beg. This famine also reminds us that we must conduct a real development aid policy. Commissioner, I am very well aware that you can back up words with figures and actions. Therefore, what sustainable development project is the Commission implementing for Niger? For Africa? What about support for agricultural exports? All these questions will constantly be asked, but I believe that, one of these days, they really will have to be resolved at European Union level.

Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, the Group of the Greens/European Free Alliance also fully supports the report by Mr Sjöstedt and congratulates him on his work. It is true that at a time when political Europe is searching for its identity, Europeans are, for their part, demanding that health protection and the preservation of the environment remain a priority for the European Union. This draft directive is directed to this end and it will also provide legal clarification. This directive is justified by the amount of waste created by mineral extractions, which we know produce each year nearly a third of the waste generated in the Union, some of which is toxic, indeed very toxic. As it is inadequately treated and stored, it can seriously threaten the environment and people’s safety. We all recall the consequences of the Baia Mare and Baia Borsa disasters. This directive must also ensure that the new accession countries have the means to eradicate pollution from waste produced by extractions in the past. Furthermore, the industrialists concerned own operations throughout the world, and in order to prevent further disasters, the European Union must set an example by implementing operating rules guaranteeing the safety of workers and better protection of the environment. If you will allow me, I would like to offer three examples: the first concerns the operation of the uranium mines in Niger by European businesses. I have some knowledge of this – they are French businesses. The issue of contaminated waste has been raised time and again, during the Irish Presidency, for example, but even now questions remain unanswered. The second example concerns the very controversial project of the opening of a gold mine at Rosia Montana, in Romania, a project that provides for the construction of a tailings pond for waste of highly toxic extraction, with a dam – brace yourselves – measuring 30 metres high. Finally, the last example calls to mind the destruction of the coral reef in New Caledonia, for which we were responsible, by extractive waste from the nickel mines. This last example, Commissioner, illustrates the need to prohibit direct discharges into continental, coastal or marine waters, unless, of course, they are compatible with the Water and Waste directives. For all of these reasons, we support the work carried out by our rapporteur and we hope that you will support these amendments.

Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, firstly allow me, as rapporteur, to thank the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Food Safety as a whole for the work that it has done. I should also like to thank its chairman for the support that he gave us in our work and, above all, the shadow rapporteurs, who really helped me to seek a compromise in order to propose something sensible and substantial. I should like very sincerely and officially to thank the whole of the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Food Safety for following my strategy, so as to endow the Union with the necessary means to fulfil its environmental policies. Overall, I believe that we have succeeded in gaining recognition, beyond the confines of our committee, for the fact that words are no longer enough for the environment and that financial means are required, as they are for every other policy. I believe that, on that issue too, the message has got through. I should, moreover, like to point out that, during a debate this week, one of your colleagues, Commissioner, reminded us that we should not lose sight of the main issue. He is quite right and we are not losing sight of the main issue, as the main issue, today, really is the protection of our planet, because it is unique, because it is fragile, because it is suffering from the pressure we put on it, and we know this full well. Today, with the European Union, we have decided to stop the haemorrhaging: we have to save what can be saved and restore what has been damaged. The European Union is aware of the challenge that it has set itself. It has already done battle and emerged victorious: Kyoto is the battle that it won, a battle for its signature, initially, and a battle for ratification later on. We can hope today that the G8 will also shoulder its responsibilities with the European countries that are going to push for measures to be taken against climate change. Neither, Commissioner, must there be any weakening of the Union’s resolve to protect the environment. On that issue, we have been rather anxious since Monday, since your president, Mr Barroso, made his statements asserting that the environment and the strategies related to it are too costly. We believe that this really is a poor assessment. The damage, we know, is global. It is happening and the longer we wait to intervene, the higher the price that we will pay, as we all know. It is therefore up to us, Parliament, to convince the Council and the Commission that, even in lean times, investing in the environment is, as it were, a prudent subscription to an insurance policy, indeed a life-insurance policy, against the threats weighing on our environment. This report on LIFE + is without doubt very important since it concerns the sinews of war: it is a financial instrument. The Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Food Safety supports LIFE +, but we wish to improve it and we have already made that known. The former LIFE programme, with its strands on nature, the environment and third countries, had unleashed innovative political impetus and had shown that investing in the environment was the path to follow in the context of sustainable development, and that it created jobs. With the new LIFE programme, the Commission is counting on the environment, as you explained, being integrated in the various policies. This is a good thing, we cannot deny it, but we are not convinced of the usefulness of delegating environmental policies to the Member States. It is well known that, often, the main issue for the Member States is not the environment. We will not, therefore, obtain results by renationalising the environment. On the other hand, the European Union has to support NGOs, because they are absolutely irreplaceable and because they must be able to continue to carry out their work, which, as you mentioned, is in everyone’s interest. Finally, we believe, as you are well aware, that the most overlooked project is Natura 2000. On that issue, in fact, we have decided to make everyone aware that Natura 2000 certainly has its costs but that it is not a bottomless pit: it is money that will be channelled into original local development based on respect for the environment and on respect for the people who work the land. You explained to us that you were kicking things into touch and that it was the responsibility of the other policies, of the other funds to integrate Natura 2000. We waited precisely until the end of the discussions on the Structural Funds, on rural development, to find out whether in fact we had the full guarantees that Natura 2000 would be taken into consideration. I can tell you that the glass is half empty or half full, depending on how you look at it. With regard to the Fund for Rural Development, we are very hopeful, but we know that it only concerns compensation, which is very positive because financial compensation is needed. With regard to the Structural Funds, we know that it concerns investment. In fact we are well aware that investment is something that is strictly defined and that we do not need to build any new roads to go and discover biotopes. There is therefore a significant shortcoming. That is why we propose to take a third of the sum that you agreed, that is of the EUR 21 billion, and to add it to LIFE + so that Natura 2000 can live and can genuinely serve to protect our environment, just as we are committed to doing.

Mr President, if you will allow me to briefly react, could I ask you, Commissioner, which side you are on? Did we not all agree to reduce the sum of EUR 21 billion to EUR 9 billion, which really is the minimum? You say, however, that nothing has been agreed in the financial perspectives, while Mr Böge stated that Natura 2000 cost EUR 21 billion. We need to have the guarantee that this EUR 21 billion will indeed be shared out across the budget. We believe that agriculture can take a third and that the Structural Funds can take another third. It is therefore for the environment to take its third.
