 Mr President, on 3 September last year, in this very House and to the cheers of those present, Mr Giscard d'Estaing presented us with the draft Constitution. A large majority of my group, for its part – convinced that, now more than ever, we need a Europe that can offer hope that the world can change, and irrespective of what we might think of one aspect or another of the text – refused to sign up to what was termed the ‘constitutionalisation of the liberal world’. Ultimately, we were unanimous in calling for a referendum, to be preceded by a major public and genuinely pluralist debate in each country. Eight months on, we are no less convinced of the rightness of our position; in fact we have, I think, been strengthened in it by the way in which the debate on the European Left has unfolded, by the experiences of several EU countries and, lastly, despite its wishes, by the work of the Commission itself. Developments in the European left’s debate on this issue have been most interesting. Indeed, in the weeks and months following the publication of the text of the Convention, we have found our position increasingly in line with that of the main spokespeople of the European Social Forum and of alter-globalisation movements. Furthermore, prominent Members of other groups of this House, or their political family, have taken on some of our arguments, even our wording, for which I am most grateful, albeit juxtaposing certain ideas that I would consider contradictory. This is nothing, however, that a calm public debate could not put right. Equally significant is experience during this entire period in different EU countries. Fierce social struggles have taken place against liberal reforms that are all rooted in the European policies of our respective governments. This is precisely why, the very day after the resounding electoral defeat suffered by the Right in France, the Commission moved to head off any risk of a shift in French politics by issuing an ultimatum that, and I quote, ‘France must pursue its reforms’. Lastly, the Commission itself has just drawn up a progress report on the Lisbon Agenda, which, four years ago, expressed the ambition of social improvement through liberalism. What exactly does this analysis say? For the first time in ten years, as the document sets out in detail, we have shed two hundred thousand more jobs than we have created in the eurozone, whereas the declared objective had been to achieve full employment by 2010. We even learn, from this same document, that more than one 15-year old European in six, to quote the Commission ‘does not have the basic skills in reading writing and arithmetic’. This offers some idea of the depth of the crisis in the liberal model, which had aimed to lead us in less than six years to the most dynamic knowledge-based economy in the world. On all of these points, most Members of my group are not expecting miracles from the European Council, which – by complete chance, of course – comes a few days after the European elections. In forcefully reiterating our demands for a referendum, preceded by a genuine debate that would allow the public to be in possession of the facts, we feel that, straightaway, a clear and unequivocal vote this June will be the best signal to give to the architects of the future Treaty. Mr President, on a personal note, if I may, I should like to conclude – given that this is to be my last speech of this legislative term – that, if my constituents so wish, I will continue to lead the fight, with my friends, in this very House, for an alternative Europe. Otherwise, we will do so elsewhere, come what may. See you soon! (Applause)

Mr President, we are witnessing one of those great moments which the history books of the future will talk about. Today we are expressing our hope for a Europe of unity, solidarity and peace. With a view to the many common battles we have before us in order to make this lovely dream into a reality, we warmly welcome the people from the ten new States of the Union. For several years our group has made visits to those countries to promote dialogue and build partnerships with the forces of progress and with many social actors. I thought of their hopes and expectations on seeing the moving images of the events in the various capitals marking the enlargement from the Europe of Fifteen to the Europe of Twenty-Five. The conclusion I draw from this is that, if we want to succeed in this wonderful project, we must have the courage to open up the in-depth debate with all our citizens that we should have launched a long time ago. It must deal with a fundamental question, which I have often raised here and which is in all our hearts: what do we want to do together and what means should we create in order to achieve it? So, is not the main raison d'être
 of this enlarged Union, for many of our compatriots, to be stronger in order to defend a progressive model of solidarity within globalisation? If that is the case, we cannot, for example, accept companies in this part of Europe indulging in the blackmail of relocation and, in the other part, seeking the least social and fiscal obligations. We must reverse this Malthusian approach with no future and accept that the real driving force for our common development is social progress and the promotion of the human capacities of all the peoples of the Union. All the instruments available to us must be employed in order to achieve this ambition. In order for enlargement to succeed, it is not sufficient to unite Europe, we must unite the Europeans! Is not another reason for building this enlarged Union together to recover, for the citizens, the powers that have gradually been handed to market forces? A document produced by the Commission’s forward studies unit stated in 1998, and I quote: ‘the Europeans are less and less willing to accept being presented with the fait accompli
. We must allow greater participation by the actors and stake holders. That is the challenge facing Europe today’. Enlargement increases the urgency of this demand tenfold. The more we remove borders, the more we must increase the new rights of the citizens. Otherwise, the law of the jungle will prevail. We must create new rights for employees, for the general public, we must promote a genuine participative European democracy, from the places where we live and work to the heart of the institutions. We should set ourselves the objective of uniting the Europeans by means of common projects, with which they identify themselves and which they have crafted. Finally, what view of the world should the enlarged Europe promote by means of these initiatives? In a recent article, Mr Cimoszewicz, the Polish Foreign Affairs Minister, wrote, and I quote: ‘It is life itself that settles the controversies not resolved by politicians’. That is true. I am convinced that, in recent times, life has in fact resolved many points which are controversial, particularly on the part to be played by the united Europe in the debate on how the world’s affairs should be managed. I believe that those are the challenges we now have to deal with together. It is in that spirit that I say – without hesitation – ’yes, I welcome the people from the new countries of the Union!’ (Applause)

 Here is a very pragmatic suggestion, Mr President. Since the Group of the European People's Party (Christian Democrats) and European Democrats and the Union for Europe of the Nations Group are relinquishing their participation in the vote on the great report, I would suggest that you have a block vote, which will save time. (Applause from the left and from the centre)

 Mr President, I suggested just now that we have a block vote, since the Group of the European People's Party (Christian Democrats) and European Democrats and the Union for Europe of the Nations Group had decided not to participate in this vote. In the meantime, however, several fellow Members of other groups have informed me that they wished to be able to vote on certain paragraphs. Not wanting us, therefore, to be in disagreement on this point, I suggest that we vote normally.

 Mr President, I should like to support Mrs Eriksson’s request for three reasons. Firstly, as she has said, this is our last chance to examine this report. If it does not appear on this session’s agenda, it will lapse. The second reason is that it has given rise to a considerable amount of work in committee. We are all aware that it has been the subject of many disagreements, but the committee has succeeded in finding a compromise. Everything is therefore ready and I think that it is only fair to ensure that all the work which has been done receives a favourable outcome. Finally, this is a social issue which is very sensitive in many countries. We may be in favour of this report, we may be against it, or we may want to amend it, but I believe that the worst thing we could do would be to give the impression that we are unwilling to deal with this subject. That is why, Mr President, I should like to insist, on behalf of our group, even though I am aware that the agenda is relatively crowded, that this question should be included in the agenda for this part-session.
Wurtz (GUE/NGL

 Mr President, one of the European Council’s tasks will be to conduct an impact assessment on the Lisbon strategy, and, in this, it would do well to ponder the lesson contained – or so I see it – in the document addressed to it by the Commission, which shows how the free-market approach that characterises the EU’s current policies is incompatible with an advanced social model based on the non-elitist and inclusive encouragement of people’s abilities. I will of course reassure Commissioner Kinnock that the Commission’s document refrains from drawing such conclusions from the four years of the Lisbon strategy, but its circumlocutions and other understatements are eloquent testimony to its authors’ embarrassment at having to draw up this particular balance sheet. One of the objectives that the EU set itself at Lisbon was full employment by 2010. How far have we got? Employment has proved pretty resistant, or so it appears from the report, which goes as far as to invent the piquant neologism of ‘delayed improvements in employment levels’, before admitting the bitter truth that, ‘in its first decline in ten years, the euro zone recorded a loss of some 200 000 jobs (in net terms) in 2003, and the unemployment rate should continue to rise slightly in 2004’. At Lisbon, the EU also set itself the goal of becoming, by the same date, the most competitive and most dynamic knowledge-based economy in the world. What view does the Commission’s interim report take of that? Let me quote: ‘following the implementation of the Lisbon strategy, this has given rise to undeniable progress, instituting the transition needed towards a competitive economy characterized by growth, etc.’. Then come the facts in all their brutality. After four years of the Lisbon strategy, let me quote the Commission, ‘the percentage of young people dropping out of the school system without any qualifications was over 18% in 2003, 17.2% of young Europeans aged 15 do not have the minimum necessary skills (reading, writing, arithmetic)’. Those are the words of the Commission. This unsparing judgment is followed up by reference to ‘the decline in overall investment, in both the public and private sectors, to the detriment of the priority areas identified by the Lisbon strategy, such as research, innovation, education, and training’. Finally, the Commission’s report offers a new and bold definition of another of the Lisbon strategy’s key concepts: ‘the sustainable development approach is beginning to be taken into account in the definition of policies [...] it is thus that several Member States have embarked on reforms to their pension systems in order to face up to the problems of an ageing population’. If that is what sustainable development is, then the Council must surely be full of ecologists. Having laboured and brought forth this diagnosis, the Commission offers its solutions: the free-market model is getting nowhere, long live the free-market model – or so its watchword appears to be. It thus sees it as ‘vital to maintain a strong-competition policy in the internal market’, going on to add that the Stability Pact must be adhered to, that it is necessary to press on with reforms to pensions and healthcare systems, that environmental policy must be made to pay, and even that the most profitable areas of education and training must be identified. How bad, though, must the social and political crises brought about by this free-market ideology be before a glimmer of critical intelligence has the chance to make its presence felt in the EU’s corridors of power? All the evidence indicates that the only way of saving the European ideal is to make a clean break with this machinery for churning out human mess and despair. After the Spring Summit, it will be time to work towards a new spring for Europe.

 Mr President, I have on several occasions, on behalf of my group, denounced the propensity of the European Council to set new priorities for the European Union while refusing to grant it the commensurate financial resources. All too often this short-sighted policy has caused us to abandon an area that is deemed to be crucial one day in favour of another area that is deemed of vital importance the next. It is by robbing Peter to pay Paul that we have, on average, survived on a derisory budget. In 2004 this reached a historic low, below 1% of GDP, which is 20% less than the ceiling on which the Fifteen had themselves agreed for the period 2000-2006. With enlargement on the horizon, this short-term vision of the Union’s responsibilities is now creating a potentially explosive situation. If the six Member States that are net contributors to the European budget actually go ahead with their plan to freeze expenditure at current levels from 2007, many fine promises will go up in smoke! The major works projects, rather hastily baptised the ‘growth initiative’, risk being buried once again. As for regional and social aid and the appropriations for the Cohesion Fund, they will melt away like snow in the sun for the majority of their current beneficiaries and many of their future recipients. Farewell cohesion! Farewell solidarity! On a social level this is known as cynicism; on a political level we call it irresponsibility. I might have severe words for the Member States concerned, but this does not mean that I am awarding any plaudits to the Commission. Your communication, Mr President of the Commission, is rather sketchy when it comes to the choices that will have to be made to meet emerging needs. Where is your previous ambition, although there is clearly more to responding to the challenge of ensuring the balanced development of an enlarged European Union than just increasing the financial perspective by one or two tenths of a per cent of GDP? I would remind you that by 2007 the Union’s population will have increased by a third. The income of our new Members is less than half that of the Fifteen and, from many points of view, I do not think that the famous acquis communautaire is doing them any favours. I therefore remain unsatisfied, Mr Prodi. I would add that the Commission’s position is not without its contradictions. On the one hand, it legitimately expects a number of Member States to increase their net contribution to the Community budget, but on the other it pushes the cult of limiting public expenditure so far as to take the Council of Ministers to court for not respecting the Stability Pact. Polite requests or punishment: you have a choice. Furthermore, many problems remain outstanding. I will mention just one: the regions that in the future will essentially be deprived of benefiting from the Structural Funds, despite the fact that there has been no significant change in their situation. Quite simply, the arrival of poorer regions in the Union will automatically – I would say bureaucratically – lower the threshold for becoming eligible for these funds. It is understandable that the forthcoming negotiations are giving serious cause for concern more or less everywhere. These are all symptoms of what to me is looking increasingly like a crisis in the European project. After the split on the war in Iraq, the ‘stupid’ affair of the Stability Pact and the breakdown of the Brussels Summit on the Constitution, we now have the debate on the budget to expose in a new and edifying way just how bad things really are. It would appear to be absolutely essential to re-found Europe. Faced with the risk of a dangerous wave of disenchantment amongst the public, as I see it our only hope is to be found in the growing call for a new kind of Europe. The coming months will be decisive in determining whether a beautiful utopia is waxing or waning.

 Mr President, Secretary-General, thank you for your magnificent speech, which was very apt and brought each country face to face with its responsibilities. We are honoured to have you with us in this House – your presence here is highly symbolic – and in our turn we too welcome, with respect and sympathy, the family and friends of Mr Vieira de Mello and the other victims of the dreadful terrorist attack in Baghdad. One year ago, Secretary-General, almost to the day, the European Parliament adopted a resolution in support of the mission of the United Nations inspectors in Iraq. Many of us still wanted to believe that it was possible to avoid the war, which we sensed would cause great devastation. In the period that followed, it became apparent that what was happening in the United Nations reflected world public opinion as never before. The public took to the streets in their millions to demonstrate, while in the Security Council the majority of the Member States resisted and did battle. On all sides the goal was the same: to try to prevent a bloody, destabilising and irresponsible conflict. Rarely has the UN been able to be as faithful as it was in those days to the first words of the Charter, ‘We the Peoples of the United Nations’. We did not succeed, but the lesson was learnt. A particular idea of how the world should be organised was, admittedly, seriously flouted by a coalition of States, but since then it has, however, been spectacularly validated by the collective experience, to the point that the former gung-ho warriors are now appealing to the UN. This idea is firstly that war is certainly no way to resolve the world’s problems. Secondly, it is that no nation, even a hyper-power, can ignore the global challenges facing the international community. Finally, it is that there is more to building a world of peace than taking action against terrorist networks. If, to our dismay, the tragic deadlock in the Middle East should persist – 13 Palestinians were killed yesterday in Gaza by the occupying army and 10 Israelis have just lost their lives this morning in a suicide bombing in Jerusalem; this is the kind of thing that must stop at all costs – should the Iraqi occupation, the war in Chechnya and the dreadful conflicts in Africa continue; should the peace plans such as the one for Western Sahara remain unimplemented; should there continue to be humiliation and despair nourished by social and cultural divides and should violations of human rights continue to mar the world, it is probable that, in the future, the world will not be safe and no one will enjoy a peaceful life. It is in all our interests to be aware of this and we all have a responsibility to create a new order. That, Secretary-General, is how we understand the particular tribute that we are paying to you and, through you, to the countless others who embody the universal values symbolised by your organisation. (Applause)

Mr President, Mr President-in-Office of the Council, Mr President of the Commission, when observers talk about the difficulties that the Irish Presidency is going to face, they all stress the fact that the constitutional process is deadlocked. I fear that this will mean that we will not see the wood for the trees. To my mind, what happened at the Brussels summit and its conclusion were only symptoms of a deeper problem: the lack of a common plan, or in any case of a plan with which Europeans can identify. The challenge that we now have to meet is more ambitious, much more ambitious than seeking a compromise of power between two black sheep in the European Council. It is to dare to go beyond what is left unsaid, the soothing proposals, the Community hangover, and dare to call a spade a spade and a crisis a crisis. Being critical is a rare commodity in both the Council and the Commission. This is why I am convinced that our fellow citizens would appreciate the major change of talking truthfully and responsibly about what is not working properly in the Union and calling for changes. There are currently numerous examples of such taboos that need to be lifted. I will just mention three of them that are particularly fundamental. First of all, there are the crises of the euro and the stability pact, because the two problems are linked. The creation of the European currency was supposed to stimulate growth, promote employment and strengthen the Union in relation to its main competitors. What has happened so far? The economy is sluggish, there is massive unemployment and the euro zone is unflinchingly enduring Washington’s predatory monetary policy. This must change. The solutions to this that have been put forward do not seem to be credible to me or seem to be no longer credible. We are also being told that the Lisbon strategy is going to have new momentum. But where has all the momentum that we have had for nearly four years got us to in terms of growth and employment? Great importance is also attached to major projects. There is no doubt that they correspond to very real needs, but by mainly using private capital, the scope of them is being significantly limited. The President of the EIB, Philippe Maystadt, acknowledges that the private sector (and I quote) ‘is interested as long as the projects are sufficiently profitable’, there is no secret about that. He goes on to say, to quote him again, that ‘the expression ‘growth initiative’ can lead to confusion. It is in no way a measure for trying to encourage a restart in the short term’. These are the circumstances under which the stability pact is supposed to continue as if there were no negative effects on public spending, as if it were to be aimed, as we would like, at renovating hospitals for example or developing research. Commissioner Solbes is going to bring before the ECJ those States that have committed the crime, of – and I quote, ‘replacing a system based on respecting rules with a system based on political decisions’ – as if this crisis in the EU were not forcing us to review the rules and launch into detailed political discussions. This must change. (Applause)
 The second example of a crisis, which is quite significant, is that of the financial perspectives, and therefore of the solidarity policy at the time of enlargement. It was the Commission that, several months ago, triggered the former. On the basis of the famous Sapir report, drawn up at its request, it took responsibility for accrediting the unacceptable idea of a reduction in the Structural Funds after 2006. More recently, the shameful initiative of the six richest countries in the EU drove the nail in: freezing the budget at 1 per cent of Gross Domestic Product from 2007, at a time when we are preparing to welcome ten new countries whose income per inhabitant is lower than half the average for the Fifteen. As there is no possibility in their minds of calling into question, the principle of the UK style refund, extracted twenty years ago by the ‘Iron Lady’, it is the solidarity funds that will provide the adjustment variable. Will we discuss this matter on 1 May, at the enlargement celebrations? If we want to make a success of this major project, this too is a factor that needs to be changed. Finally, there is well and truly a crisis in terms of the EU’s external action. One year after the major clash of choices at world level regarding Iraq, we have gained a great deal of experience. We now know that a State lied about weapons of mass destruction. We now know that a major power can win a war alone but is powerless to win peace. We also know that the occupation of Iraq is in fact feeding the terrorism that it was supposed to overcome. Everyone now knows all of this, but the Union is incapable of saying so and of learning lessons from it. This must change. In the Middle East, which is urgently appealing for us to reinvigorate Europe’s role, the building of the annexing wall, stone by stone, is giving rise only to tentative statements. What are we doing to protect the Palestinian people? What are we doing to support the courageous efforts of Israeli and Palestinian figures who are unprecedentedly working to restart dialogue and negotiations? What are we doing to speed up the international conference planned in the route map? To be honest, we are doing very little. This must change. My group sees all of these expectations of Europe that are being expressed in different regions of the world as an excellent opportunity that we should grasp. I am thinking of Latin America, where democracy is emerging, which is standing up to the hegemonic designs of the White House and is seeking genuine partners who respect its identity and sovereignty. I am thinking of the most heavily indebted countries which, given the obvious failure of initiatives from international financial institutions, are suffocating, with no concern from the international community. I am thinking of our partners who were disappointed in the Barcelona process, whose grievances we need to listen to so that we can restart Euro-Mediterranean and, more generally speaking, Euro-Arab relations. May the Irish Presidency, An Taoiseach
, take strong action in these different areas that can bring to life the image of a Europe that listens more to the criticism it receives and the hopes that it raises. This is what I see as your greatest task.

 Mr President, President-in-Office of the Council, President of the Commission, on 3 September last, in this very place, Mr Giscard d'Estaing presented us with the draft constitution for Europe. I was extremely critical of the text at the time, since I and my group saw it as constitutionalising the liberal model by perpetuating the most contentious part of the Maastricht Treaty both in its direction and as regards the institutions. The project is now frozen for several months. Some might think that gives us some satisfaction, but for my part that is far from being the case. First because the course of liberal Europe is not affected by this failure. It will continue for one simple reason: it is unfortunately not the subject that divided the 25 governments. Everyone, from Mr Berlusconi to the Polish Prime Minister, has been keen to underline that there was consensus on virtually every point of the draft constitution apart from the method of calculating the qualified majority in the Council. All the problems so forcefully raised in the growing public debate on the draft constitution, in the recent European Social Forum for example, are therefore still on the table. That is nothing to be pleased about. Then we had the distressing spectacle of ambition for power and dreams of power, with no comparison being made of the options for the Union’s policies, objectives and values, seemingly echoing that stupid watchword ‘Nice or death’, a complete denial of the politics and spirit of responsibility. This Europe long in tooth and short on ideas, alien to people’s expectations and insensitive to the frustrations welling up everywhere, is a princely gift to populists and demagogues of all kinds. This failed prelude to an enlarged Europe is likely to have a devastating effect on all who have real ambition for Europe – an alternative ambition to the present treaties, but a strong ambition nevertheless. Finally, this impasse is giving new life to the outdated old ideas of the hard core. Only too glad of an opportunity to pull out, the richest countries are threatening to cut back the funds intended for the least developed. By doing away with the notion of solidarity between Member States, such a development would be the death-knell of any community, allowing the dream of the most liberal to come true, the free trade area. We cannot accept such a view. It is a caricature of the idea of closer cooperation between nations, some of whom want to see a more advanced social model and some a more independent and more offensive international policy prevail without waiting for an impossible unanimity of 25. But for that to happen there would have to be a real European political project within the European Council. But the truth is, there is no project, except perhaps for that very ambiguous one of European defence, made worse by the Union’s new strategic doctrine that makes your blood run cold simply by reading it. There is the rub. The way this European Council has gone and the results it has produced ought to convince the doubters on one point: because of the major changes it will require to the present institutions and directions, a project that our fellow citizens can identify with and feel part of will not, will never come about spontaneously from a conclave of Heads of State and Government. A convention will not be enough either. The challenge must now be taken up by the citizens who aspire to it and the parties with which they identify. In my view, it is this level of ambition, more than ever, that will have to shape the next stage in European policy. (Applause)

Mr President, we are approaching the term initially set for the work of the IGC. The Presidency-in-Office of the Council has just reminded us of the main sticking points still remaining: the membership of the Commission, the duties of the Foreign Minister, the definition of the qualified majority in the Council, the role of the European Parliament in the budgetary procedure and the procedure for reviewing the Constitution. These are not minor issues. Some of them involve the distribution of powers between institutions and Member States, others involve the highly sensitive issue of national identities and others are aimed at not locking ourselves within almost unchangeable institutional structures. Anybody who imagined that this type of friction would not arise in my opinion was guilty of a lack of realism. For my part, I am in no way surprised nor disturbed by these conflicts. If they were the only obstacles to be overcome in order to be able to celebrate the success of the Conference, then I would say, as the Italian Foreign Minister, Mr Frattini, has done in other places, that today we have a solution to 95% of the problems. Alas, that is not the case. Because there is clearly a dimension of this draft Constitution which appears to be as taboo for the Heads of State and Government as it was for the President of the Convention. They are the Union’s policies and, in particular, what I called on 3 September, on talking with Mr Giscard d'Estaing, the constitutionalisation of the liberal model or, to use another register, the establishment, in a fundamental law for the future Europe, of a genuine act of allegiance with NATO. The Union only has significance for the citizens by means of the implementation of its policies. It is not me who says this; it is the Commission, in its communication of 17 September on the Constitution. However there is never any questioning of the Union’s policies, which represent three quarters of the draft Treaty. Do you believe therefore that there is unanimity on this point within public opinion? That would clearly be foolish. I will perhaps make some of you laugh by referring, to this end, to the European social forum which has just taken place in the region of Paris. It would be a great mistake, therefore, to take an ironic or indifferent view of the appeal that has just been addressed to the Union. Hundreds of debates involving 50 000 young people from every part of Europe has demonstrated their thirst for knowledge, for understanding, for change and for concrete action, expressing, at the same time as totally rejecting the liberal model, a profound desire for Europe. How should we respond to this? In view of the continuation of all the Community acquis on the single market and of the Treaty of Maastricht, they will not be satisfied with a subparagraph 2 of Article 3 which promises paradise on earth. They call for genuine changes, and it is on this basis that large numbers of the public demonstrate their sympathy. In certain countries, such as France, the debate, which did not exist until 3 September, when we raised right here the problem of the hidden face of the draft Constitution – which you have mentioned, Mr President – has continued to spread and deepen ever since. To the extent that there are numerous observers in these countries who do not rule out the possibility of a victory for the ‘no’ in the event of the ratification of the Treaty by means of a referendum. As a general rule, you will tell me, we have not reached that point. For the moment calm still reigns within public opinion in numerous countries. Well! Should we rejoice at this? We should not trust still waters. The silent unease of today risks creating landslides in the elections of tomorrow. I much prefer a rather disordered response, though showing generosity and solidarity, and without any chance of things become worse. This is why I would like, on behalf of my group, to appeal to those of you who shared this approach. Europe has for too long been built from the top. That is no longer the case today. We must demand vigorously that the calls from our societies be heard and taken seriously. We have little time left to react and give sense to the European project in the eyes of our citizens.

 Mr President, this pre-election incident has absolutely nothing to do with my group, which is why I had intended to keep quiet. (Mixed reactions)
 Nevertheless, I feel that this incident reveals something that has long been clear to me, namely that the Commission’s claim to represent the general European interest is a claim on which it is unable to deliver. (Applause)
 For my part, I would prefer to see the right and left of Parliament opposing each other with this kind of passion over European Union policies, rather than opposing each other over career plans and affairs of state. (Applause

 Mr President, I am sure we all remember the heartfelt cry Mr Giscard d'Estaing gave here on 3 September: ‘Never forget the citizens!’ Our Heads of State or Government have clearly failed to take this piece of friendly advice. The impression that they give of their exchanges on the draft constitution is rather pathetic and takes us back in time: this is Nice all over again. The problem is not that the issues they addressed are not worthy ones. They are, however, entirely cut off from what most citizens consider to be the crucial issues: what are the ambitions for the future Union? How will society’s expectations be met? How much will is there to change the course of the current trend of globalisation? Consequently, the discussions taking place unfortunately resemble a power struggle, lacking any vision capable of capturing the people’s imagination. I believe that the European idea is frankly worth more than that. Some observations made by the President of the Commission in his letter to the President-in-Office of the Council also appear to be incapable of stimulating any kind of excitement about Europe amongst the general public. His remarks suggest that European citizens increasingly feel it is important for the Union to press ahead with the structural reforms decided on at Lisbon. These are the proposed reforms on retirement pensions, on social protection, on the labour market, on public services, and yet it is precisely this type of measure that is increasingly frequently setting workers, pensioners and the unemployed, from Rome to Paris, via Berlin, against this caricature of harmonising European policy. What, furthermore, are we supposed to think about the aim stated in the same letter and I quote, ‘to speed up the adoption, at European level, of measures that will enable us to exploit the potential of legal immigrants, while maintaining a firm stance in the fight against illegal immigration’. Does this two-pronged approach really express the concept of Europe-South relations that we wish to promote in the eyes of our fellow citizens? It will definitely grate on the young people who have embraced the idea that another world is possible, a world without predators and without fortresses. These young people feel that a genuine and proactive development policy that gives new hope to the peoples of the South must underpin the solution to the problem of people immigrating in order to survive. More generally, however, is it not time to show the entire European public that the essentially utilitarian and security-based approach to immigration is a dead end, as demonstrated by the unbearable and endlessly repeated tragedies such as the recent example that occurred in the waters surrounding the island of Lampedusa? Mr President-in-Office of the Council, Mr President of the Commission, lastly, and in conclusion, I wish on behalf of my group to put forward a practical, constructive and achievable proposal, which would enable you to make one of those gestures that honour the Union in the eyes of our fellow citizens, because they really bring to life the values that we claim imbue our texts. This proposal concerns peace in the Middle East. As you know, extremely courageous men and women, both Palestinian and Israeli, have spent two years working on a new peace plan, without sidestepping any of the problems that have impeded all official negotiations to date. Some of these people are eminently representative individuals from the fields of politics, the military and culture, including the former Speaker of the Knesset, Avram Burg, with whom we are all familiar. This plan has just been made public and this afternoon, two of its creators, Naomi Shazan, former deputy Speaker of the Knesset and Mr Jamal Zakoud from the Palestinian Legislative Council will join us. At 4 p.m., they will present their historic initiative to all Members who wish to hear. Beforehand, President Cox will receive them and I wish to thank him for doing so. I propose, Mr President-in-Office of the Council, President of the Commission, that you also receive these individuals and that you honour with your presence, or that at least the Council and the Commission honour with their presence, the formal signing of this peace plan in Geneva on 4 November, the anniversary of Yitzhak Rabin’s assassination. This would be a gesture for peace and what gesture could better stamp Europe’s identity on the world stage?

 Mr President, it may be possible to reconcile the two positions: firstly, we would accept the joint proposal from our two groups to debate Chechnya on Wednesday afternoon and secondly, we would defer the point on Bolivia to Wednesday evening, which means that it would be addressed in the presence of the Commission only. Opting for this solution would, I think, enable us both to express our views on Chechnya and also say what we think about the bloody repression in Bolivia, which, I would remind you, has led to the deaths of almost eighty people in the space of one week.

 Mr President, Mr President-in-Office of the Council, Mr President of the Commission, the European Council will take place at a time when Germany, Italy and Portugal are going through a recession and when France is poised to follow them. In addition to these countries, the entire euro zone is experiencing an economic downturn and, in many ways, a downturn in social protection too. There is now such a wide gulf between the supposed benefits of the completion of the internal market and the introduction of the euro and the everyday realities of our fellow citizens that we are entitled to call for a genuine public and pluralist evaluation of the guidelines that have been followed and of the instruments with which the Union has implemented these guidelines. It goes without saying that the course of action I have recommended bears no relation at all to the anti-European demagoguery of some senior political leaders – starting with those of my own country, Mr Watson – who use such talk to cover themselves in the eyes of their electors. These leaders accuse Brussels in order to make people forget that their own Head of State personally negotiated the Treaties and signed the Stability Pact. They only complain about the harshness of the procedures in force when they themselves are faced with a powerful and entirely legitimate resistance movement made up of workers in their own countries. Above all, they do not call into question the very mindset of the stability pact and even less that of the Phare institution whose pact is ultimately just its bodyguard: the European Central Bank. Its mandate and its statutes make those of the Central Bank appear to be the most liberal and untouchable in the world. This is precisely why I believe the evaluation that I have just mentioned to be so necessary. It is true that when economies are so interdependent, there must be common rules and these must be observed. What rules, though, and to achieve what objectives? This is the crux of the matter. What have we gained from this approach of attracting capital in rivalry with the United States, at the cost of a permanent and almost obsessive quest to bring wage costs down and to check social spending? What have we gained from this cult of price stability, at a time when our economies are suffering, not as a result of inflation but of deflation? Do you realise what each of these fine steps forward praised by Commissioner Solbes mean for people’s lives? In France, today, they are nothing more than a good mark, given for freezing public spending until 2007 and even reducing it – and this covers the budgets for young people, education, work, accommodation, transport, research – and for halving current health spending. This is an unacceptable prospect for the French people, and for the citizens of Germany, Italy, Portugal or anywhere else and I believe it is frankly irresponsible to have forced the future Member States beforehand to undergo shock therapy – which actually consists of shocks without any therapy – in the name of an acquis communautaire
 or accepted body of Community legislation which, incidentally, is by no means accepted by millions of Europeans. It is true that there is a deep need for social transformation and, therefore, for change in European policies. It would be marvellous if the European Council did not create a deadlock over this clear state of crisis and instead gave us its diagnosis and solutions, followed by a real debate with our fellow citizens. One alternative approach is for us to address monetary policy and hence the role and workings of the European Central Bank. The priority of monetary policy and of the ECB must, we believe, be to promote human capacities and consequently, first of all, making employment and training more secure for everyone. Their task would then be to make our countries much less dependent on the financial markets. Politics must control the market and not the other way around. Consequently, the idea of a selective credit policy, which would be extremely favourable to the investments that support our new political priorities but a real deterrent to those who do not support them, would come up against a genuine confrontation of opinions. This, in any event, is the type of debate that needs to be held to enable Europe’s citizens to state their feelings about the draft Constitution in full knowledge of the facts. (Applause)

 Mr President, Mr President-in-Office of the Council, Commissioner, thank you, Europe, for the unanimous stance it adopted at the UN General Assembly. Europe’s assistance will be more important than ever in salvaging the situation. This is the message given to us on Saturday, in Ramallah, by President Arafat, who was visibly relieved to have the impassioned support of his people in the face of Ariel Sharon’s relentless hounding of him. At the same time, however, he was extremely concerned at the increasingly intolerable situation facing his fellow countrymen. After the staggering decision of principle taken by the Israeli cabinet to expel an elected president from his country, and even, if comments made by the number 2 in the Sharon government are to be believed, to physically eliminate him, my group wished, through the intermediary of its chairman and of our colleague Mrs Morgantini, the chairman of the Parliamentary delegation for relations with the Palestinian Legislative Council, to express on the spot what the vast majority of European citizens, including many who are actually critical of the Palestinian Authority, think about this extremely serious precedent. This decision is completely unacceptable and I think that it must give food for thought to anyone who thinks that accommodating Ariel Sharon will encourage him to relax his approach. The main lesson that we can learn from our meetings in Ramallah, and also in Jerusalem and Tel Aviv, is that there has never been a greater need for external political intervention in order to create a momentum for negotiations that offers a population on its knees some hope of a worthy and equitable peace. I still remember the ominous words of Commissioner Patten on the eve of the war with Iraq: he basically said, to a barrage of applause from our House, that the one thing he was sure about, was that if this war takes place without a political solution being found for the conflict in the Middle East, we will see an upsurge in terrorism. This is, unfortunately, the situation now facing us. The ‘road map’ was supposed to take up this challenge and is in a doubly strong position to do so. Firstly, this is a general political plan, not one concerned solely with security. Because it makes sense, the Palestinian people will be all the more willing to rally forces to prevent terrorist acts as their daily lives become liveable once again and as their fundamental rights are recognised. Furthermore, the route map has four official godparents, not just one, whose credibility as peacemaker is at its lowest ebb. And yet, four months after launching this initiative, what remains of it? What has become of the ‘road map’, what has happened to the ‘quartet’ and, for that matter, what is Europe 
doing? At this crucial time, the European Union is unavailable to its subscribers. I would like to believe that the unanimous vote given by the 25 in New York last week is a sign of a new awareness as regards the collective responsibility that must be shouldered in the region, and Mr Solana, due to speak to Parliament on 9 October, will then explain the political strategy, the practical goals to attain and the timetable of the initiatives decided on in Council to prevent the worst case scenario from arising and to give fresh hope to the Middle East. My own conviction is that, of the priorities for launching such an initiative, three warrant particular attention. First of all, we must refuse to give in to Ariel Sharon’s blackmail where President Arafat is concerned. It is one thing to support the idea that reforms are needed in the Palestinian Authority. This debate is already taking place in Palestinian society, and is legitimate and healthy. It is another matter altogether unquestioningly to accept the de facto
 imprisonment of an elected president in the ruins of his headquarters. What is even worse is the fact that we are bowing down to the veto imposed by the occupying force whilst failing to meet the man seen by his entire people as the living embodiment of Palestine. Significant action is required, in my opinion, to put an end to this terrible ambiguity. Next, we must strongly oppose the wall that is being built. This is not simply a border that is questionable only in its appropriateness. This constitutes a blatant incursion into internationally recognised Palestinian territory. The wall cuts through the University of Aboudis, near Jerusalem. It cuts through the very heart of Bethlehem. It is depriving Palestinian farmers of crucial irrigated land to the north of the West Bank. The wall’s construction has entailed further land confiscations, further expulsions, and to further check points and foreshadows a Palestine in pieces. This is a scandal of such proportions that even President Bush has taken umbrage at the action of his protégé
. If the White House itself is threatening to remove US credit guarantees for Israel if Israel continues to forge ahead in this opportunistic way, the European Union must finally be bold enough to state clearly that the association agreements with Israel will only remain in place if there is a change of direction in Ariel Sharon’s policy. Lastly, we must attach priority to all Israeli and Palestinian initiatives to halt the violence and to reopen political dialogue. I am thinking in particular of the coalition for peace, whose prime movers are Yossi Beilin, former Israeli Minister and negotiator of the Oslo agreements and Yasser Abed Rabbo, outgoing Palestinian government Minister, also a steadfast proponent of Israeli-Palestinian dialogue. These two remarkable personalities have furthermore just accepted the invitation I sent them, on behalf of my group, jointly to visit the European Parliament in mid-November and speak to us. I am also thinking of one of the most symbolic of all Palestinian prisoners, Marwan Barghouti, a member of parliament and also someone who is highly committed to the Oslo negotiations and whose prestige, particularly amongst Palestinian youths, could help to persuade the most recent recruits to engage in dialogue rather than in violence. Lastly, Mr President, I am thinking of Yasser Arafat himself, who has just reiterated his determination to work on achieving a ceasefire and not just a truce, if his efforts and those of the prime minister, Abu Mazen, are not blown out of the water by targeted assassinations and house demolitions. The President of the State of Israel, unlike Ariel Sharon, has called for this prospect to be taken extremely seriously. I believe that high-profile initiatives by the European Union in this direction are highly pertinent. This is the express request of my group, but this is above all the dearest wish of supporters of peace on the ground who would like to be able to say as soon as possible, full of hope ‘Europe is back’
. (Applause)

Madam President, Commissioner, at our initiative, the Alstom trades union representatives have visited the European Parliament on several occasions. As long ago as 1999, they condemned serious management errors committed by the group’s directors. On 17 February 2000, here in Parliament, we adopted a resolution expressing a warning about the future risks facing the business. At the time, certain people stood up to speak and, in the name of the sacrosanct principles of liberalism, condemned this as an incongruous and, inevitably, incompetent intrusion of politics into economics – an experience that should give us all pause for serious thought. The coordinator of the Alstom Europe unions, Mrs Francine Blanche, was telling me yesterday evening that the employees were naturally pleased about the Commission’s approval, in principle, of the rescue plan. However, they remember the many warnings given by their elected representatives, warnings that have never been taken seriously at any level. They are not about to agree to be the victims of this rescue now. Mrs Blanche gave me to understand that, since his appointment in January of this year, the new chairman of the group, Mr Kron, had devoted no more than two hours to discussions with the European representatives of the employees. Such arrogance is no longer tolerable. The need is enormous, and the demands are loud for those employees to exercise their rights as employees. Already, Commissioner, Alstom’s European trades union coordinators are asking to be received, heard and listened to by the Commission. In the meantime, they will have studied the plan in detail and will be in a position to propose measures to achieve savings which will not take the form of job losses. That is what will happen in the immediate future. After that, this enormously important affair places certain major questions squarely on the agenda of the debate on the future of the European Union. I shall mention three of these. The first of these issues is the social dialogue, or rather the essential new rights of employees. Those timid and dust-covered directives on informing and consulting workers and on the European Works Council must be revised. Real rights must be established, even the right to suspend a restructuring plan so as to enable a second expert opinion to be obtained and all the available options considered. The second issue is that European industrial policy does not exist. All that exists is a race for state aids in the name of the competition rules. Yet in the present case, conversely, if there had not been any state aids, world economic competition would have been seriously distorted, given, on the one hand, what would be left of European industries in the strategic sectors of energy and the railways and, on the other, American giants such as General Electric, or those of Japan such as Mitsubishi. Thirdly, the democratic functioning of the Union makes it necessary to review the discretionary powers granted to the Commission in competition matters. It is essential that the social partners, the national parliaments and, of course, Parliament should have their say as regards the criteria to be met, the objectives to be assigned, and the controls to be exercised. Where would have been the legitimacy, in the minds of our fellow citizens, in implementing the Commission’s initial threat to refuse the rescue plan for a strategic business which employs 118 000 people? Finally, the Alstom case is a powerful reminder of the essential political choices to which the public debate on the European constitution will be leading us. For all these reasons, it was well worth adding this item to our agenda.

 Mr President, the Commission is to give its opinion on the Alstom rescue plan by this evening. This is a group which has 118 000 employees and whose activity encompasses industries which are of great importance for the European Union. Far from seeing only the European aspect of the issue, I would point out that the group’s previous board of directors and the French state are also greatly to blame. That said, the European Union is implicated, with regard to competition rules, state aid and also the inordinate power wielded by the Commission in these matters. That is why I feel that the Alstom affair points, in some way, to the strategic choices that we have to make for the future of Europe, particularly in terms of adopting a Constitution. My group therefore proposes that, if possible, the issue be included in tomorrow’s agenda in the form of a Commission statement followed by a debate.

 Mr President, at the next part-session, we shall have an in-depth debate on the strictly institutional dimension of the draft Constitution. Then, my group will emphasise what it considers to be positive advances: new parliamentary prerogatives, a willingness to encourage ordinary people to get involved, and certain elements of transparency. It will also express views on other, much more controversial institutional aspects and explain why it is making the case for ratification through referendums. Today, I am going, however, to tackle a more global problem and ask a sort of preliminary question. A constitution is, in principle, a fundamental law determining a country’s form of government. It is also able to lay down a number of benchmark values and fundamental rights. In no circumstances can it aspire to restrict for thirty to fifty years – for that is the lifespan of this document, as promised by President Giscard d'Estaing – the freedom of sovereign nations to choose their own model of society. Democracy means choice. Now, what we have before us, in addition to reform of the institutional system, is a process whereby the model of a liberal Europe is given constitutional status. We thus learn from as early on as Article 3, and I quote, that ‘[t]he Union shall offer its citizens … a single market where competition is free and undistorted’. On four occasions, there subsequently recurs the liberal theme of an open market economy characterised by free competition. It is, however, precisely against this obsession with all-out competition and against this inclination to reduce the whole of life in society to the level of a commodity that a growing number of our fellow citizens are protesting and mobilising. A factor further to the discredit of the Praesidium of the Convention is the fact that most of the provisions setting up the model of a liberal Europe as inviolable appear in the third part of the document. Unbeknown to most people outside this House, the 340 articles comprising this part – in other words, three quarters of the entire draft Constitution – have not been subject to any discussion within the Convention during the 16 months of work, the results of which were presented to the Thessaloniki European Council. It has to be said that they were added on the quiet and after the event, right in the middle of July so that the majority of editions of the Constitution in circulation quite simply ignore them. That is, as it were, the hidden face of the draft Constitution. It is, however, this part that defines, in particular, economic and monetary policy and the inordinate powers of a European Central Bank obsessed with price stability and the rise in salary costs. In other words, it is the most disputed content of the Treaty of Maastricht that you have thus taken up and perpetuated. These articles also list the drastic restrictions placed upon social policy, as well as upon the conception of public services, tolerated in terms of mere, and I quote, ‘reimbursement for the discharge of certain obligations’ and as departures from the rules of competition and from the provisions prohibiting state aid. Deeply convinced as I am that, now as never before, there is a European need for hope in transforming the world, I think it would be very damaging to provoke, in this way, many anti-liberals into becoming anti-Europeans. That is why I would ask you this question, President Giscard d'Estaing: might nothing therefore change concerning future trends in the European Union, whatever the political developments in one or other European country? Is that not a legitimate question? It is valid in terms of the economic and social dimensions of this project, as well as in terms of its political dimension, since Article 40, for example, foresees the common security and defence policy being, and I quote, ‘compatible with the … policy established within [the] framework [of NATO].’ Is NATO to be a constituent part of European identity? We can, emphatically, do better in terms of European ambition, the rehabilitation of politics and the promotion of responsibility on the part of individual citizens. As you very rightly stated, never forget the citizens, Mr Giscard d'Estaing. I await your reply.

 Mr President, a number of us feel a particular affection for Italy, for the extraordinary vitality of its society, the creativity of its people, its exceptional cultural heritage and the richness of its local, socially aware democracy. We love the Italy of the great popular demonstrations demanding employment, social justice and equality; of the vigorous anti-war movement; of the socially aware demonstrations in Genoa against social and police violence; and of the European Social Forum in Florence. It is an Italy that is young, demanding, enthusiastic and combative because it is convinced, as emphasised by its main watchword, that another Europe is possible and because it is determined to bring it about. This other Europe is one which provides itself with the resources to loosen the grip of neo-liberal globalisation in order to make employment, training, retirement and social welfare more secure for its citizens, to guarantee proper public services and to improve the standard of living – in short, to place people’s lives above the demands of the market. This other Europe is one founded upon ethics and equality before the law, one that banishes elitism and exclusion, prohibits privileges and submission and eradicates the poison of intolerance, racism and xenophobia from within our societies, as well as from Europe’s relations with the rest of the world. This other Europe is one emancipated from US tutelage and daring to make another voice heard in the great international institutions in order, together with its allies from the South, to tackle the open wounds that make the planet less and less safe and habitable and that go under the names of poverty, underdevelopment, environmental disaster and war. Like ourselves, this fine, unbiddable Italy does not identify with current European Union trends. With all the more reason, it is disgusted by the policies of those in government in Rome who are carrying European trends to the point of absurdity. Their neo-liberalism is unrestrained, their Atlanticism unconditional and their taste for democracy rather half-hearted. One of the priorities of this Presidency is a mammoth project to develop infrastructure. This would warrant careful examination on a case-by-case basis, for blatant needs do, in fact, exist, like that for a ‘piggyback programme’ on a scale appropriate to the EU. Relying upon private capital to carry out such work that will only be profitable in the very long term is, however, to head towards certain failure in the areas of employment, growth and quality of services. Another of this Presidency’s priorities is to force the pace at which advantages in terms of pensions and social welfare are dismantled. This is the trademark of the most conservative forces. As for the plans relating to immigration and the right of asylum, which need to be finalised in the course of the next six months, revulsion is the only possible response to the idea that this ultra-sensitive debate might be sullied by the barbarous cries of rage to which one of the personalities in the current coalition is frequently given. We finally learned yesterday that formal decisions will have to be taken between now and December concerning the EU’s new strategic doctrine which, when outlined before the start of the Italian Presidency, had already elicited great fears. Therefore, extreme vigilance will be required in all respects throughout these six months. If the current constitutional process is to have any meaning, let us begin by ensuring compliance with Article 2 of the draft Constitution, devoted to the values of the EU and worded as follows: ‘The Union is founded on the values of respect for human dignity, liberty, democracy, equality, the rule of law and respect for human rights. These values are common to the Member States in a society of pluralism, tolerance, justice, solidarity, and non-discrimination’. (Applause from the left)

 Mr President, Mr President-in-Office of the Council, Mr President of the Commission, in my speech I shall concentrate on a subject which was dealt with at the European Council in Thessaloniki, a subject that has hardly been mentioned up to now, but which is one of considerable scope. I too would like to talk about the document presented by Mr Javier Solana entitled ‘A Secure Europe in a Better World’. On several occasions I have called in vain for a response from the European Union to the publication, on 20 September last year, of the new strategic doctrine of the United States, which was first applied in practice in the ‘pre-emptive’ war against Iraq. Nine months after Washington, therefore, the Council has just given birth to its own strategic doctrine. No doubt it is purely by chance that this text first saw the light on the eve of the Transatlantic Summit. What, then, does this document say? Let me give you a few quotations. ‘With the new threats the first line of defence will often be abroad. The new threats are dynamic. Left alone, they will become more dangerous’. This quotation explains the meaning of that other enigmatic phrase contained in the document, ‘Pre-emptive engagement can avoid more serious problems in the future. …. we should be ready to act before a crisis occurs’. Then, just in case things are still not clear, I quote again: ‘In failed states, military instruments may be needed to restore order …’ and, more generally, and still quoting, ‘We need to develop a strategic culture that fosters early, rapid, and where necessary, robust intervention’. Finally, there is the inevitable, ‘Acting together, the European Union and the United States can be a formidable force for good in the world’. We cannot believe our ears when we hear such mimicry of the ideas and even the language of the current tenant of the White House. If we can believe the press agencies, even Mr Prodi, in the crowd, showed his enthusiasm for President Bush by declaring that when Europe and the United States were united, no enemy would be able to stand up to them. On what basis, however, are we to be united, and for what purpose? That is the question, Mr Prodi! It is not by complaisance that we shall earn the respect of an American administration which despises Europeans, including the most conciliatory among them. Of that, for my part, I am convinced. Europe will exist as an essential actor on the world stage when it has the political will to use its economic clout, its political influence and its capacity for forming strong partnerships, particularly with the South, in order to help to create rules that are different from those that prevail at present, so as to achieve a globalisation with greater solidarity and greater democracy, and so as to create a peaceful world. The document presented in Thessaloniki turns its back on such a prospect and gives us an apocalyptic description of the threats, without ever examining their causes in any depth. The conflict in the Middle East is dealt with in four and a half lines out of a total of fifteen pages of text. The concept of fighting for security that is described therein gives precedence to the military dimension, even though this approach has proved ineffective from Kabul to Baghdad, and even in the United States itself, whose vulnerability was so tragically emphasised on 11 September 2001, despite the fact that that country alone accounts for 40% of the world’s military spending. In this context, the references in the Council document to the multilateral system have a hollow ring to them. After all, the main issues here have to do with the WTO, the international financial institutions and NATO. The United Nations is mentioned only in order to ask that in future the European Union should be ready, and I quote, ‘… to act when their rules are broken’. We can recognise, in this allusion, a call to order addressed to those member countries of the Security Council who opposed the ‘material breach’ argument quoted by George Bush as grounds for going to war with the backing of the UN. For all these reasons, my group believes that the taking of this first step towards a new strategic doctrine of the European Union would be a turning point, the implications of which we would have to explain, and the dangers of which we would have to emphasise, to our fellow citizens. Given the power of the recent mobilisation of European public opinion, in both East and West, against the argument in favour of war and American supremacy, you can be certain that you will have to explain yourselves. I would ask those Members who are motivated by the knowledge that it is civilisation that is at stake here, to join, at 3 p.m. today, in hearing the views, on this subject, of two eminent experts, one, Mr Pascal Boniface, from Europe, and the other, Mr Philip Golub, from America. Let us debate the issues with frankness, for it is the whole significance of the Europe of the future that is at stake. (Applause)

 Mr President, Mr President-in-Office of the Council, Mr President of the Commission, the Greek Presidency has been characterised by particularly seminal deadlines for the future of the Union, such as the signature of the accession treaty by ten new countries and the probable conclusion of the Convention’s work. I would like to focus, however, on a third major event, which is more important than any other: the sudden appearance of the Union’s identity crisis. What do we want to do together? This existential question remains, more than ever, unanswered, certainly with regard to our internal ambitions for the Union. Do we genuinely want to set ourselves the objective that the praesidium of the Convention proposes should be included in the future Constitution of the Union, namely balanced economic growth and social justice, full employment, high living standards, social protection and equal opportunity for all? In that case, why refuse to open the debate on a change in the priorities of the European Central Bank? Its priority should no longer be price stability, at a time when there is a risk of recession, but instead protection of jobs, training and pensions for all women and men, the funding of useful infrastructures, such as large-scale piggybacking, and, more generally, genuine, fair, sustainable development. Why confine public services to the precarious status of a derogation to the rule of free competition, instead of making the promotion of high-quality services of general interest a priority of the Union, one consequently included in the Constitution? Why continue to block any possibility of taxing the movement of capital and financial income? This kind of blatant contradiction between the statement of objectives corresponding to expectations and the rejection of means that would enable us to achieve them is at the heart of the lack of trust felt by our fellow citizens with regard to the European institutions. What do we really want? We must respond frankly and take responsibility for our choices so that Europeans can participate in the debate in an informed manner. As Albert Camus wrote: ‘Mal nommer les choses, c'est ajouter au malheur du monde’ (‘To name things wrongly is to add to the misfortune of the world’). This identity crisis is equally obvious with regard to the role of the Union in the world. This has become only too clear since the war against Iraq. Before the conflict, contradictory, but frank, voices at least enabled public opinion to be clear on the matter and become involved in this confrontation of choices. They did so in such a spectacular manner and so uniformly from Western to Eastern Europe that this sudden crisis, in our opinion, represents a real hiatus in the history of the Union and the only hope of future change. On the other hand, since the show of force by the world superpower, against the law and will of the international community, it seems as if the European Union is rebuilding its unity on the basis of resigned or enthusiastic subordination to the fittest. Paul Wolfowitz admits that the crusade to eliminate weapons of mass destruction in Iraq was merely ‘a bureaucratic pretext to gain acceptance for the war’. This tremendous deception has called forth no indignation among the Fifteen, let alone among the Twenty-five. This was confirmed this morning, and I regret it. George Bush decides to monopolise the management of the road-map for the Middle East, with all the risks entailed by his complicity with Sharon and the latter’s reservations on the very substance of the commitments to be made; the European Union, despite having jointly initiated this fragile hope of peace, allows itself to be ousted from the scene with no resistance. The United States rejects the International Criminal Court, maintains special military courts, detains – as Mr Barón Crespo pointed out – European citizens in a law-free zone in Guantanamo Bay; the Council nevertheless prepares an extradition and mutual legal cooperation agreement with Washington, turning a blind eye to all these broken rules. Our US partners relaunch their attack for the moratorium on GMOs to be lifted in order to protect US agriculture; Europe instantly starts to waver, holding back from applying the trade retaliation measures that are authorised by the WTO itself against the thoughtless tax advantages granted to exporters in the US. For all these reasons, Mr President, my group considers that the Greek Presidency would serve Europe well by raising this entire problem clearly at the Thessaloniki European Council: what do we want to do together and what means are we providing ourselves with in order to achieve our objectives? In any case, in our societies, the question has now been raised and that is a very good thing. Earlier, I quoted a French author. For good measure, I shall end my speech by quoting the great German, Hölderlin: 
‘Where there is danger there is also salvation’. It is clear where the danger lies for Europe. Let us be among those who seek to save it.

 Mr President, although I feel it is legitimate for Mr Hume to raise a practical issue, the need to improve air connections, and I support his request, I also find it shocking that a Member of Parliament should challenge the right to strike in the countries of the European Union. I would point out that this case is not specific to France. On 13 May, Austria experienced its first national strike in fifty years, on the same subject: pension protection. I welcome this. If we want to remedy the mistrust that currently separates the European institutions from the citizens, therefore, we should not follow Mr Evans’ bad example. Quite the opposite, we should show solidarity with our fellow citizens.

 Mr President, the last time we took a stance on Iraq was before the war, when Parliament expressed its full support for the United Nations inspectors. At that time, we stated that none of the reasons put forward at that time justified a war and that ‘any further steps must be taken by the Security Council after a full assessment of the situation’. Have we nothing to say about the extremely serious events that have taken place since then, which have been in total conflict with this line? That is what seems to be indicated by the majority decision of this House not to conclude this debate with the adoption of a resolution. This petty decision would be rather trivial if it did not reflect a much deeper, serious defect of the European Union, namely its inability to define its identity and defend it with vigour. This failure to take political responsibility has been spectacular since George Bush first implemented his new strategic doctrine. To those who, like my group, feel that it is essential to react, in particular by looking towards what the New York Times calls ‘the other superpower’, in other words the general public who are actively opposed to the idea of war, I propose three closely linked priorities. The first is to refuse to accept a fait accompli
 in Iraq. The Iraqi people have been both freed from a dictatorship and plunged into chaos. Having spoken to long-time opponents of Saddam Hussein, I can tell you that, on 9 April 2003, many hearts and minds experienced a mixture of joy and suffering, relief and humiliation. As the days passed, exasperation took over as a result of the blood spilt, the extent of the damage, vandalism and looting, the military occupation and the US civil proconsul. All this, while the supposed motive for the war – the accumulation of weapons of mass destruction, of which George Bush, Tony Blair and José Maria Aznar all have irrefutable proof, of course – is running out of credibility. Our second priority must therefore be to make an active commitment to ensuring the effective implementation of the Middle East roadmap. The Union is co-initiator of this roadmap and therefore cannot rest on its laurels in the fact of the daily attempts by Sharon’s Government to destroy this slim chance of peace, in the belief that the current host in the White House will always understand its reasons. Finally, we must all help to determine where the mad venture of pre-emptive war will lead us if Europe does not manage to muster the political will to do all in its power to nip it in the bud. The fight against terrorism and against the proliferation of weapons of mass destruction is vital. This dangerous imperial shift, however, is a completely different matter. I reiterate today, Mr President, for the third time, the request by my group for Parliament’s first major, in-depth debate on the new strategic doctrine published by George Bush on 20 September. This cynical homage to the law of the most powerful seeks solely to debase all of the principles of the United Nations Charter, as demonstrated once again even now by the US draft resolution to the Security Council. It is time for Europe to raise the alarm and to take up its responsibilities. That is what the majority of our citizens, from Strasbourg to Warsaw, expect of us. Our own roadmap could consist of seeking to meet this expectation. In any event, my group is ready.

 Mr President, I would like to inform the House that the Conference of Presidents unanimously decided to include Mr Herman Schmid’s report on employment guidelines in the agenda for Thursday morning, provided, of course, that it is adopted by the relevant committee this evening.

 Mr President, the great majority of my group will vote to allow the Accession Treaty for the ten new countries to be signed. We cannot however approve Mr Brok’s report on the conclusions of the negotiations between the European Union and the candidate countries. You may ask why we are voting in this way. If Parliament were not to vote in favour of enlargement, the candidate countries would automatically be shut out of the Union, regardless of the views of the citizens of the countries in question. Whatever we think of the circumstances surrounding enlargement today, we believe the people of each of the countries concerned should have a free choice on the matter. On the other hand, the Council’s show of force on the budget aside, adopting the Brok report would amount to awarding a gold star to the fifteen Member States for the way in which the enlargement negotiations were conducted and concluded. This is precisely where the shoe pinches. In our opinion, we will need, sooner or later, to change the fundamental objectives of the current enlargement process and European integration as a whole. We agree with Mr Brok that enlargement can help to build, I quote, ‘an ever-closer union among the states and peoples of Europe’. It will allow disagreements to be dealt with through negotiations within the common institutions, so promoting peace and security in Europe. Enlargement will also, I quote, ‘assure influence for the citizens of Europe’ in world politics. We therefore support enlargement. I am very much afraid, however, that this is merely wishful thinking and that the basic issues concerning the future of Europe are not being addressed. This is why Mr Brok is delighted with, I quote, ‘the consensual outcome of negotiations’. We should ask ourselves whether the outcome really is a consensual one. It may have proved consensual in official meetings, but what about the feelings of the people of the countries in question? Has the House forgotten about the candidate countries’ vehement rejection of the stance of the Fifteen on support for agriculture, the obvious inadequacy of credits available until 2006 and the restrictions on the free movement of people? Has the House never been asked for the liberal acquis
 imposed on the candidate countries to take better account of their social problems, the employment situation, the fragile nature of their economies and specific national issues? Each country has its own history. The Copenhagen criteria require countries to have ‘the capacity to cope with competitive pressures and market forces within the Union’. For the sake of this requirement, these countries have in fact been pushed into privatising and jeopardising many industries and into liberalising trade, even if this meant creating a huge commercial deficit. Low salaries have become a comparative advantage in the competitive market. The market was increased but people’s rights were not. Where will this leave Europe if we allow enlargement to 25 members to proceed in this way? Furthermore, if Europe does not have the confidence of the peoples of the Union, how can it hope to have an influence in world affairs? In fact, this experience compels us to open a great public debate, both in Member States and candidate countries. This debate must engage society as a whole, not just governments. We must consider what kind of Europe we wish to present on the international stage, faced with the unwavering and bellicose unilateralism of the United States. We must consider how best to move from a Europe based on liberalism, towards a Europe truly based on social values and solidarity. The House should also contemplate how to reform our institutions to involve citizens in the great process of the transformation of Europe. We should take account of these questions when it comes to the main items on the agenda for 2004, namely enlargement, the new treaty and the European elections. We should campaign on them everywhere from Strasbourg to Warsaw, and from Helsinki to Nicosia! (Applause)

 Mr President, the humanitarian situation was appalling prior to the war in Iraq because of the embargo. It is now disastrous. We have all been aware of that for a long time, however. It is not news. When our delegation of 31 Members of the European Parliament went to Baghdad two months ago, we met the UN agencies, who warned us. Their representatives told us that, if there was a war, the situation would be disastrous. I am therefore very pleased to say that the UN did not wait for Europe’s support to address the humanitarian situation. I consequently believe that Europe, which was unable to condemn this war and call for it to be brought to an end, should not try to salve its conscience by debating the humanitarian situation in this House. Of course, we should shoulder our responsibilities, but there is no point in making a much overdue statement on this issue. I am therefore against such a statement.

 Mr President, as dawn broke over Baghdad this morning, the people were awoken by the awful, deafening sound of the first bombs falling on the city. These people were the very men, women and children who some of us saw going about their daily lives, met and questioned just a few weeks ago. We are haunted by their faces at this terrible time. They know that 3 000 missiles will be dropped on Iraq from the first phase of the war. They are expecting to see, or perhaps to see once again, the fierce and unrelenting attacks on their country by terrifying fleets of F15s, F16s, B1s, B2s, B52s, Awacs and Apaches. President Bush brazenly refers to notions of honour and moral principles and appeals to God, when he has taken the most inhumane and inexcusable of decisions. He has decided to interrupt the peaceful disarmament of Iraq in order to launch an attack on a country worn down by previous wars and by a criminal embargo, where, we have been informed, 50% of the population is under fifteen years of age. President Bush plans to launch an attack against this country involving 600 fighter planes, 70 warships, 6 aircraft carriers, columns of tanks and 300 000 soldiers. It is possible that some of the 600 journalists embedded in the armed forces will bring us pictures of popular rejoicing. Perhaps we will see Iraqi people welcoming their liberators with sweets and flowers. This is what we have been promised by George W. Bush and Kanan Makiya, a prominent figure amongst pro-American Iraqi exiles. According to the New York Times Magazine
, this advisor to the President, who has lived in Cambridge since 1968, apparently spent much of his meeting at the White House in January explaining to his distinguished host that there are two types of Muslims in Iraq: Shiites and Sunnis. This just shows the depth of knowledge of this country and consideration of its future at the very highest level of political power in the United States! Can it really be true that these are the people who intend to decide on peace or war, instead of the international community? What are they offering the Iraqi people? The eviction of Saddam Hussein? The Iraqi people will doubtless not mourn the loss of their dictator. But then what? Will there be a long-term American military occupation of one of the largest and most emblematic of Arab countries? Who can truly believe that this would be accepted? Furthermore, what are they offering the rest of the world? Will they pursue battles with other rogue states? This is what General Wesley Clark, the former head of NATO forces in Yugoslavia, has led us to believe. To paraphrase his words, he said that if our ultimate aim is to put an end to the threat of terrorism, Iraq will be just one battle in a wider campaign. Do we really know the extent of the destabilising chain reaction we are initiating in the region? This will pose a threat to the whole world. A superpower with the greatest supremacy the world has ever known is openly affirming its imperialism, even if this means exacerbating divisions, increasing worldwide unrest and nurturing terrorism. History will note that public opposition to this irresponsible policy was mobilised and expressed strongly throughout the world. History will note that courageous people, including the leaders of the Churches, made their voices heard. History will note that some governments dared to raise their voices in opposition and stand their ground in the face of pressure, slander and even threats. What will we remember about the role of Europe in this historic situation? I must say that I have not heard any comments this morning on the fundamental issue. Will the European Union dare to demand the immediate end of this unjust, illegal and dangerous war? What will it have to say about the fate of the Iraqi people,… (Applause from the left)
 ... including Kurdish and Iranian refugees who may be threatened by this war? Whether or not there is unanimity between all the Member States, there are stakes that Europe can and must win, whatever the circumstances. What is at stake is the fundamental basis of the international system, in place since 1945, and the law it embodies in the eyes of all democracies. Europe must therefore express its view on the new strategic doctrine of the Bush administration, which exalts military force, justifies a unilateralist approach and legitimises pre-emptive war. The European Union must strongly oppose the very grave precedent set by the American Secretary for Defence in failing to rule out the use of tactical nuclear weapons or nerve gas against Iraq. The European Union must also unequivocally condemn the irresponsible decision, taken unilaterally by a group of countries, including two Member States, to start a war without the approval of the UN Security Council, and against the will of the overwhelming majority of its members. The European Union must commit itself in a much more proactive way to restarting the Middle East peace process, to find a just and lasting solution to the Palestinian problem. Now, in allowing the war against Iraq to go ahead, we are allowing the situation in the Middle East to deteriorate to the lowest possible level. The President of the Arab League has warned that we are opening the gates of hell. Parliament is the only European institution to have made its stance on this war clear. (Applause from the left)
 I would like to remind you of the terms of the resolution we adopted on 30 January this year. Parliament reaffirmed its commitment to peace and the rule of international law. We voiced our full support for the work of Dr Hans Blix and Mr ElBaradei. We expressed the opinion that the violations of resolution 1441 thus far identified by the inspectors did not justify military action. We voiced our opposition to any unilateral military action. We expressed our view that any pre-emptive attack would contravene both international law and the Charter of the United Nations. We stated that such action would result in an even greater crisis involving other countries in the region. This, at least, will provide our President with the basis of a clear, explicit and strong intervention to make at the European Council today. But even then, we shall not have heard the last of this. In light of the extremely serious situation developing before our very eyes, which may seriously deteriorate, we must assume our responsibilities and turn the tide of war. Old Europe must prove itself capable of setting out a vision of a new world. We must listen to the urgent pleas of our fellow citizens. This is what they expect of us. (Applause from the left)

 Mr President, President-in-Office of the Council, Commissioner, even though the vote in the Security Council has not yet, as we speak, taken place, we already know that, whatever happens, it will leave only one legal option open, namely the peaceful option of disarming Iraq via the inspections. Anyone who took it upon themselves to go beyond that mandate and to start a war unilaterally would be defying the whole of the international community. I hope that they would be calling upon themselves exemplary political penalties exacted by their own peoples. As for their credibility in the eyes of the world, it would no doubt be adversely affected for a long time. To show too much of one’s 'hard power' is to run the risk of ruining one’s 'soft power'. Unfortunately, it is the whole of international society that would run the risk of being destabilised by this material breach of the rules which democracies laid down for themselves after the Second World War. Yet this is precisely what the President of the United States is envisaging quite shamelessly. It is not only the war on Iraq that should spur us into action, but also the unilateralist – and in our view imperialist – policy that surrounds that war. When it comes to taking action, we are short of neither trump cards nor allies. Never, since the end of the cold war, has there been, on a world-wide scale, such a powerful camp clearly in favour of peace and promoting the law and multilateral cooperation. It is within that camp that the voice of Europe promoting world solidarity must and will have to make itself heard. Our allies are, first of all, the people of the entire world, starting with those of the European Union, not just the 15 current Member States, but the 25 present and future Member States. This makes even more legitimate our demand for in-depth discussion between Member States and with our partners, before the ratification of the accession treaties and the vote on the future constitution and on the vision of Europe which we intend to promote together in order to respond to the will expressed by our fellow citizens. This unprecedented explosion of public opinion has, no doubt, made it easier for a large majority of the governments of the world to take a stand against the war, starting with the governments of the countries of the South, and, in particular, the Non-Aligned Movement, which alone represents two thirds of the United Nations General Assembly. That is our second trump card. In that respect, how despicable and crass is the blackmail used by Colin Powell on the most dependent of those countries in order to try to extract from them a vote without any popular support! We are also supported by all of what the world regards as great moral authorities, such as Pope John Paul II, Nelson Mandela, former President Carter and the Secretary General of the United Nations in person, Kofi Annan, all of whom have committed themselves with passion and dignity to the cause of peace and respect for the United Nations Charter. Let us also pay homage to all those authorities on international law who teach at Oxford, Cambridge or the London School of Economics and those three hundred eminent Spanish legal authors, who all deny that there is any legal justification for the use of military force against Iraq even before the event. Another important dimension is the contribution of the weapons inspectors, who have shown great firmness towards Baghdad while, at the same time, standing up to Washington and London, which they have not been slow to accuse of having given them false information. I should also like to make special mention of those men and women working for the UN agencies, who are often, along with certain European representatives in the region, the only ones to think first and foremost of the people of that region, and of the torment that is being imposed on them in Iraq, in Palestine, and in the Arab world in general. Thanks are also due to Mr Patten for some of the strong and just words that he spoke on the subject this morning. Another influential player on the scene today is the Franco-German alliance, which will have held good, even though it means paying the price of political courage in the face of a greater power. As for other allies, it was on the other side of the Atlantic that we found them. We, that is to say the diverse delegation of Members of the European Parliament who had already visited Baghdad last month, have just established, at the US Congress, long-term cooperation links with the elected representatives of Washington, Ohio, California and even Texas. There, you have a United States which does not despise Europe, but which places its hopes in Europe and welcomes its representatives with open arms. What, then, did our US friends tell us? They told us that 126 elected representatives voted against war, notably two thirds of the Democrat representatives; that 130 US cities, including Washington, Philadelphia and Los Angeles, have adopted resolutions opposing military action, that AFL-CIO, the major group of affiliated trade unions, has declared itself to be of the same opinion, and that the anti-war movement (United for Peace and Justice, Women for Peace, etc.) is receiving unprecedented support prior to the start of the conflict. The New York Times, too, has chosen to say no to war. This is a far cry from the sacred union that some people have been telling us about. Congressman Dennis Kucinich, the spokesman for the coalition for peace, echoed these sentiments when he told us, ‘George W. Bush has threatened to isolate those Europeans who are resisting his claim to supremacy; this is a perfect moment to take one another by the hand’. Finally, Mr President, may we each have the US friends that we deserve.

 Mr President, my group is also against a resolution, probably for slightly different reasons from Mr Poettering, because – not in December, Mr Poettering, but on 30 January – we adopted a resolution stating quite clearly that the majority of Parliament is opposed to military action without a UN resolution. It is that Parliamentary resolution, therefore, that is still valid today. If the situation were to change, it would clearly also change as far as we are concerned. What is more, according to our information, the Security Council vote will, in any case, take place before we have had time to act in this regard.

 Mr President, I would like, on behalf of my group, the Confederal Group of the European United Left/Nordic Green Left, to strongly criticise the disgraceful treatment of the dock workers earlier today in front of this building. We consider their protest to be legitimate and we support them. It should be pointed out that the aim of the proposal for a directive they are criticising is none other than to reduce salaries and, therefore, to authorise the recruitment of staff from outside the docks to do the work instead of them. This means the destruction of their status, their trade and their jobs, and we expect them to come to the European institutions bearing flowers! I find this police control unacceptable! We should listen to them, we should hear what they have to say and review the proposal for a directive accordingly. (Applause)

 Mr President, the European Union is facing a test of truth. The attitude which it will shortly be taking towards the prospect of a new Gulf War will be crucial in defining our vision of Europe and our conception of the world. It will have to shoulder its responsibilities in circumstances which will leave no room for one of those woolly consensuses to which, all too often, we have become accustomed thanks to the common foreign and security policy. Hemmed in by the pressure from the Bush administration’s call to arms on one side and the demands of European public opinion, which is massively opposed to it, on the other, there can be no middle way: we shall have to choose. In these circumstances, what message should Parliament be sending to the European Council? Its resolution of 30 January was clear on the essential points, and is still entirely in line with our current view. Allow me to add a few points drawn from the moving experiences of the delegation of over thirty Members of the European Parliament, drawn from eleven countries and four political groups, which has just returned from Iraq. First of all I should like to brush aside the insidious remarks of those who have tried to portray us as being under an obligation to Saddam Hussein. On the contrary, even in the opinion of the journalists who were present, ours was the most independent delegation of any in recent times. After all, our links with the democratic opposition to the Baghdad regime and our absolute rejection of Saddam Hussein are sufficiently well known to enable me not to waste any more time on this unfounded, petty accusation. I hope, in this respect, that the European Parliament’s ad hoc delegation to Iraq will not stop in New York but will continue to its final destination, Baghdad. Our delegation, by contrast, will proceed rapidly to New York and Washington, where the anti-war movement is growing day by day, reaching right to the heart of Congress. Well then, what did we see and hear in Iraq, and what collective conclusions have we drawn? First of all there are the accumulated impressions and observations of the life of the population, from Baghdad and its most deprived suburbs to Basra, in the south, and Mosul, in the north, with its enormous camp for Turkish Kurd refugees. Everywhere, poverty is on a massive scale, and there has been spectacular social regression according to those who knew Iraq before the Gulf War, and even more so compared with what the country was like before the war with Iran. There is no longer an economy, apart from oil, exports of which have fallen by half due to lack of investment. In rural areas, all activities have collapsed, desertification is progressing and the population exodus is speeding up. UN agents are sounding the alarm: one third of the population is suffering from chronic malnutrition, and one third of children are seriously underweight. Infant mortality has exploded in the last ten years. More than eight thousand schools are in ruins and need repairs that would now be too costly. Students have no books, and teachers earn the equivalent of a few euros per month. In Iraq today, people do not live, they try to survive thanks to the meagre assistance provided by the 'oil for food' programme, which is financed using revenue from hydrocarbons and is managed directly by the government. This is the result of twelve years of embargo, and it is absolutely essential to put an end to this unbearable collective punishment. It is possible to get an idea of the memories left in people’s minds by the war, by going, as we did, to the so-called demilitarised zone in the south of the country. There, the heaps of countless wrecked tanks, cars, jeeps and buses remind us that, in the final hours of the conflict, even as the Iraqi troops were falling back, a final bombardment claimed more than thirty thousand needless victims. Against this background, now, the predominant feelings are of fatalism, resignation, and silent traumatisation. A new war would undoubtedly lead to the catastrophic disruption of supplies of food and water. It would be a humanitarian disaster. In our view this reason alone is enough to rule out absolutely any new recourse to war, whatever the circumstances. There is also another reason, however, namely the risk of destabilising the whole region, starting with the Middle East, where the Palestinians are currently facing one of the worst situations in their history. The other striking experience in our view was our meeting with the spokesman of the inspectors and the director of the UN inspection centre in Baghdad. What they told us makes good sense. First of all, as long as the inspectors are present, it will be difficult for Saddam Hussein to manufacture prohibited weapons. Then again, it is completely impossible to complete such a mission in the space of two months, but given time, resources and the cooperation of the authorities, it will be possible to achieve the international community’s objective, namely to ensure that Iraq no longer constitutes a threat to the world. This is why we stated publicly, on the spot, that in our view, at the present time, the only chance for Iraq lies in complete cooperation with the United Nations inspectors. This is also why the Franco-German proposals seeking to strengthen the resources of the inspectors now constitute, in our view, the only acceptable outcome of this crisis, ruling out any military action. This is the position that our group expects Member States to adopt, especially those among them who sit on the UN Security Council, particularly if they have the power of veto, which if necessary they should use if that is the only way of refusing to sanction the shameful actions of a team which is drunk with power and is currently placing world peace and equilibrium at risk. What credibility would the United Nations be left with if a policy of giving in to the strongest party were to lead a handful of states to violate so cynically the spirit of the UN Charter? Next Saturday, throughout the world, a tidal wave without precedent in many countries will rise up and say no to war. We hope that as many Members of the European Parliament as possible will be seen at these demonstrations, because Europe has a duty to say no to an imperial machine, whose new strategic doctrine, as published by the Bush administration on 20 September last, illustrates its nature and its scope, namely the cult of military power, the thirst for domination, the claim to be able to act alone, if necessary, on a preventive basis, in order to achieve objectives which have nothing to do with world security. Following the events of 11 September, we said that we were allied but not aligned. This handful of Member State leaders who are ready to divide Europe at a signal from the White House needs to be reminded of this principle. As for the candidate countries, I believe that this is the time to let them know, in all frankness, before the ratification of the accession treaties, that we must be clear about our common ambition: let us not confuse the new Europe with the reform of NATO. We must keep abreast of European public opinion as it emerges throughout the continent. In the eyes of an increasing number of our fellow citizens, what the United States has gained in power it is losing in confidence, owing to the Messianic and megalomaniac behaviour of its leaders. This situation gives the European Union a historic responsibility, not against America, but against the dangerous desire for hegemony on the part of those who claim, on its behalf, to dictate to the world, only to lead that world into chaos. We are, as I said, facing a test of truth. History has not yet been written. Let us hope that those who are holding the cards are able to measure the weight of their responsibility. (Applause)

 Mr President, High Representative, Commissioner, we are on a knife-edge. On the one hand, the Security Council has given the inspectors the green light they wanted to continue their mission in the short term; on the other, the US-British armada in the Gulf is increasing in size by the day, much like the pressure to launch a military attack. In this context of great tension where the stakes are so high, any ambiguous political words or action on the war, but also, where applicable, any absence of initiative against the war, actually constitute an advantage for the most aggressive and unilateralist government the United States has ever known. A builder’s work can be recognised from its foundations, and, in the same way, Europe’s ambition on the global stage can be measured in a critical international situation. Mr Solana, you seem to welcome the common position of the Fifteen, or in any case of the four countries that currently sit on the Security Council. This does not merit such rejoicing. The declaration had only just been published when London and Madrid, in particular, were already stripping it of its substance by stating, respectively, that there was a flagrant violation of resolution 1441, and that the extension of the deadline granted to the inspectors should be as short as possible. Still others are doing their utmost to find passages in Dr Blix’s report to take out of context in order to try to justify military intervention. Everything seems to imply that, in the eyes of some, it would not be good news but bad news if Dr Blix were to state that the inspectors had been able, overall, to access all sites easily, to the point of having carried out 300 inspections in 60 days. Or if Mr ElBaradei thought it were possible, and I quote ‘within the next few months to provide credible assurance that Iraq has no nuclear weapons programme’. Of course there are still grey areas that absolutely must be clarified. We will not, however, achieve this through bombs and blood. We must speak frankly and on the other hand be far more aggressive in demanding that the inspectors be allowed to take the time they need to complete their work. Beware of playing down war! Beware of gradually and insidiously accepting the unacceptable! Let us therefore review everything that Europe has accepted, with little or no reaction, from Ariel Sharon in Palestine over the past two years. He does not deserve congratulations, Mr Solana. We must resolutely fight his disastrous policy, including for the Israeli people themselves. (Applause)
 What did Europe have to say about George Bush’s new strategic doctrine, published on 20 September last, which magnifies, and I quote, ‘the unequalled strength’ of the United States and emphasises, and I quote once again, their determination ‘to act alone, if necessary […] pre-emptively’ in order to ‘further freedom’s triumph’. What does Europe have to say now in response to the irresponsible statements made by the Secretary-General of the White House last Sunday, implying that the United States would not rule out the use of tactical nuclear weapons in case of conflict in Iraq. Weapons of mass destruction must be destroyed and banned in Iraq, throughout the region, and all over the world. We must listen to public opinion. (Applause)
 Mr Blair and Mr Aznar are isolated in their own countries over the question of war. There is an overwhelming majority against war in Germany. Four out of five French citizens are asking Paris to use the right to veto if necessary to try to prevent the worst from happening. On the other side of the Atlantic, a movement unprecedented since Vietnam is gathering momentum, based on the slogan, and how clear it is: ‘No blood for oil’.
 (Mr Le Pen: It sounds like Europe in 1938!)
 Calm down! We are not interested in hearing what you think about it. My group would like to be able to state these values, state these requirements in Iraq itself, without the slightest leniency towards the authorities, Mr Watson, quite the opposite – nobody, furthermore, will find in my entire political history the slightest leniency towards this dictator, nobody, which is not the case of certain right-wing governments – ... (Applause)
 ... without the slightest leniency towards the authorities, therefore, and within a population that has already suffered the effects of a criminal embargo for twelve years. That is why my group is unanimous, as are my Green and socialist fellow Members, and even Members from other parliamentary groups, in suggesting that a delegation of Members should go to Baghdad from 2 to 6 February. There will be more than thirty of us. In the same vein, my group suggests sending – and will do so – a delegation to the United States. In Baghdad and in New York or Washington, we want to defend an idea of Europe, Mr President, in which many progressive men and women still place their hopes. We must not let them down! (Applause)

 Mr President, President-in-Office of the Council, President of the Commission, there is no doubt whatsoever that the Copenhagen Summit marks an historic stage in European integration. I would like to thank the Danish Presidency for its active contribution. We must welcome the fact that, ultimately, nothing has compromised the conclusion of your work at this late stage. Enlargement can and must represent an opportunity for Europe in terms of stability, peace, unification of the continent, bringing nations closer together, interaction and co-development opportunities, as well as in terms of increasing Europe’s influence on the world stage. Can we now say, therefore, as you said last Saturday, President-in-Office of the Council, that – and I quote – ‘we now have a common vision of an integrated Europe’? I, for my part, would be slightly more cautious. With regard to the peoples of the candidate countries, I do not think that we are all square. At the end of the long and tortuous negotiation process, some wounds still have not been healed. My belief is that we may sooner or later have to pay the price for launching negotiations with these countries, negotiations whose content I believe is much too liberal in substance and whose form is sometimes perceived to be arrogant. For example, has anyone assessed the shocking effect on all the people of the countries concerned of the discriminatory measure taken in the area of direct agricultural subsidies for between now and 2013? This choice has, in my view, considerably strengthened the underlying feeling that the Fifteen view the countries of Central Europe as second-class members. Furthermore, the drastic safeguard clauses imposed on our partners have also added to the impression of unequal relations between a David and a Goliath. Let us also point out how strictly the Community acquis has been applied to them, in spite of their fragile economy and the exorbitant social cost of an abrupt transition to a market economy. In addition, by limiting themselves to a minimum financing level, which is still below 0.1% of their annual GDP, the Fifteen have given the impression of opting, if you look beyond the words, for a cut-price enlargement. Throughout this process, the Union has been caught out, on more than one occasion, posing arrogantly as the rich and powerful benefactor of the poor relation, who has no other choice than to bow down or withdraw. It is no coincidence that the Polish Foreign Affairs Minister spoke, just prior to Copenhagen, of a diktat, or that his colleague responsible for agriculture spoke of capitulation. Beware of the boomerang effects of internalised humiliation! Let us not forget that the ratification referendums are due to take place early in 2003. I therefore believe that we should make a gesture towards our partners: send a sign of respect and openness, demonstrate, in particular, that we do not view the acquis as set in stone, when reality reveals its limitations or contradictions in one area or another. The Fifteen did indeed view the Stability and Growth Pact to be part of the acquis until Mr Prodi to some extent played down its relevance. The citizens of the candidate countries are not the only ones to be struck by doubt or uncertainty either. The citizens of the current Member States are too. As soon as citizens start to feel that they are not genuinely involved in a project, as soon as they feel their lives are dependent on inaccessible decision-making bodies, which rapidly churn out standards, laws and various injunctions that often have serious consequences, they immediately perceive, rightly or wrongly, the risks rather than the opportunities of any new undertaking. That said, the enlargement process has been conducted without the citizens thus far. Surveys tell us that four out of ten EU citizens can only give the name of one candidate country, and, out of those who can name one, almost a third say Turkey. In this respect, too, we need initiatives. We must encourage every possible meeting between people of Eastern and Western Europe to discuss the challenges that they face and which stir them into action. Today’s news is dominated by the challenges facing society which, from safety at sea to migration, jeopardise the enlarged Europe. The same applies to the need to provide secure employment and training and to safeguard services of general interest, to the necessary pre-eminence of political choices over market requirements, to the role of the Union on the world stage and to the part played by social players in the decision-making process. As we move towards the adoption of a new Treaty, which, in addition, is constitutional, the project of an enlarged Europe and its purpose must be debated in our societies. Otherwise, we will have no defence against a major incident which could undermine the civilising project that we all wish to succeed. Lastly, Mr President, this major enlargement has been described – outside this Chamber – as a revenge for Yalta. I think it is wrong to embark upon this line of thinking. We cannot build anything sound or sustainable on revenge. This Cold-War approach is, I believe, completely outmoded. The unification of Europe must enable us to overcome all the tragedies of the twentieth century. This is possible, as long as we do not look back nostalgically at the past, to a blessed era of ‘Middle Europe’, the heritage of the Hapsburgs. We must now look confidently towards the future so that we can work together to enable a united Europe to enter the twenty-first century.

 Mr President, the starting point of my group’s deliberations on the issue of the Member’s Statute must be observing that there is a crisis of confidence between the citizens of most of our countries and the politicians. It is a major political challenge to resolve this crisis, perhaps the most important political challenge to be tackled in the near future. All our actions must take this objective into consideration. As it happens, the Confederal Group of the European United Left–Nordic Green Left believes it is necessary to ensure total transparency in the conditions governing the exercise of the parliamentary mandate and to dispel any idea of privileges for Members. In my view and in the view of the broad majority of my group, that requires two things: the first is that we need a statute in the very near future, in other words, some time before the June 2004 elections. Therefore, in the proposals that will be negotiated with the Council, we must not include provisions that we already know are unacceptable. Otherwise, we might as well be saying that we do not want a statute. The second requirement, in our view, is that the content of the proposals that we put forward must respect the positions of principle that I mentioned earlier – particularly transparency and the rejection of any notion of privilege. I do not intend to insult or offend anyone by saying this, Mr President. It is quite simply to explain why my group is opposed – and has already said so – to Parliament sending the document by the Committee on Legal Affairs to the Council in its current form. To give just two examples, Article 9 of the document claims to guarantee future Members virtual impunity. This is inexcusable, and the article regarding remuneration calls for a huge rise in allowances for most Members. At a time when the Union is advocating austerity measures to be imposed for employees and calling for public spending to be rationed, this might sound like a provocation. Obviously we find this unacceptable. Let us be honest therefore. Those of you who wish to come to a swift agreement with the Council on a Members’ Statute must not, at tomorrow’s vote, approve the report by the Committee on Legal Affairs in its current form as this report would obviously rule out the prospect of reaching an effective agreement on a statute. On the other hand, by voting in favour of the compromise resolution by Parliament’s three ‘pivotal’ groups, you will leave the way clear to seek an agreement that the broad majority of us, of you, say you want. Tomorrow, each of us will have the opportunity to shoulder our responsibilities. (Applause)

 Mr President, Mr President-in-Office of the Council, Mr Prodi, President of the Commission, my group is broadly in favour of enlargement, because we see it as an historic opportunity to bring together the peoples of Europe, to consolidate peace on the continent and to transform this Union of 25 Member States – and in future 27 or 30 States – into the new global player that all those who oppose the excessive liberalism and unilateralism of American leaders would dearly love to see. In this respect, I do not feel that it is very wise to conceal the problems. I shall therefore say this openly and honestly; the decisions of the Brussels European Council have left us unsatisfied. Of course, we welcome the fact that the list of the ten proposed members has been approved, but, in our view, the terms of the agreement reached between the Fifteen on the budgetary and financial issues for the 2004-2006 period do not augur well in terms of the ability, if not the will of the key European leaders to make a reality of a vision of Europe that lives up to the aspirations that I have just outlined. We have already seen discrimination in the way that direct aid has been allocated to the farmers of the candidate countries. I was recently able to witness the extremely negative political effect of this measure in some of the countries concerned. In addition to this, the total amount of funding set aside by the Commission for structural actions has been reduced. We feel that this amount was already far from sufficient given the considerable work that needs to be done to combat disparities in development in the future, enlarged Union. It is in the interest of everyone to make a lasting success of enlargement, but the cost that this will certainly entail cannot be, as is the case at the moment, according to current plans, around 0.08% of the fifteen Member States’ GDP for each of the first three years. The medium-term objective must be very ambitious: to provide job security and training for all men and women throughout the whole of the enlarged Europe, to consolidate public services that are worthy of the name, to achieve genuinely sustainable development in all 25 Member States, and as a result combat social and fiscal dumping. We must also redefine the tasks and powers of the European Central Bank and do away with the obsessive rationing of worthwhile public expenditure, which will require a rapid and in-depth revision of the financial perspectives. All these issues must be laid on the table and debated openly, involving the national parliaments and social players. At this very moment in Florence, the European Social Forum is setting an example by bringing together citizens and young people in particular from across the continent to discuss the challenges of society and civilisation that we are all facing. If we make a success of enlargement, we will also meet their expectations. I fear that, with the Brussels European Council, we are falling far short of them.

 Mr President, Mr Solana, Commissioner, I listened carefully to Mr Solana’s comments on Iraq. I was extremely surprised, however – since President Bush has not yet ruled out the threat of another war against Iraq, with or without the UN resolution – that the Brussels European Council found nothing to say about this. Moreover, the Union in its current form has hardly said anything about this highly sensitive issue. The only ones taking action are a few States that are members of the Security Council, and also some forces of peace which are working together. In this area, Mr Kucinich, a member of the US Congress and Chairman of the Congressional Progressive Caucus sends us this message: ‘We can still avoid this war. Let us work together for peace, cooperation, for a new era in human relations where war has no place. I welcome every opportunity to work with you to create this new world’. Mr President, I dream of a Europe, of a united Europe capable of taking up the challenge before it. Europe does not do this at the moment, this is the existential challenge that we must accept. In the Middle East, more than twenty years ago, there was the declaration from the Venice European Council, which called for an end to the Israeli occupation, which stressed that the settlements were illegal, which acknowledged the right to Palestinian self-rule and which insisted that the PLO must be involved in the negotiations. That was more than twenty years ago! Much more recently, in March 1999, the declaration of the Berlin Summit explicitly recognised the right of the Palestinians to a State. But today, when the situation is worsening dramatically day by day, when the Oslo Accords are cast aside and forgotten, when the radical elements of the occupiers responds to the radical elements of a part of the occupied, how can we interpret the silence of the European Union Member States? My group does not believe that this can go on, that the silence and the half-hearted measures can continue. We need firm initiatives which can demonstrate to the world, and more importantly to the peoples of the region, a political, clear will, encouraging the supporters of peace to take action. We need to kick-start this issue. For the time being, I shall put forward a practical proposal. The Thursday of our next sitting will be the eve of the 35th anniversary of the celebrated UN Security Council Resolution 242 which is one of the international community’s major reference points in the conflict. Well, I suggest we organise a formal occasion involving Parliament, the Council and the Commission in Strasbourg. I suggest we also involve young supporters of peace, young Europeans, young Palestinians, young Israelis, those who gathered en masse last Saturday in Tel Aviv to commemorate the assassination of Yitzhak Rabin. Each of our institutions will therefore be able to state clearly what, in its view, in accordance with international law and our common values, is unacceptable and, conversely, what type of plan for fair and lasting peace we want to draft.

 Mr President, President of the Commission, President-in-Office of the Council, Commissioner, we are preparing to take an historic decision. The headlines of a Brussels newspaper yesterday said that in just over a year we will have to talk about the Twenty-five instead of the Fifteen. This is in itself good news. I think I speak for my group as a whole in welcoming all these European nations. We shall have to rise to the common challenge of successful enlargement. In order to succeed, however, we must address each and every problem if we want to avoid providing grist to the mill for people-pleasers or the shameful opponents of enlargement. And there is the rub. President of the Commission, I feel your presentation failed to address some serious problems. Let us take as an example the Community acquis, the most taboo subject of all. To you, and to many of my fellow Members here present, it is all or nothing. Any candidate country that questions any part of it would be excluded from negotiations. We all know, however, that some implications of the acquis will lead to acute, serious, dangerous social crises in these countries. We will not solve these problems by burying our heads in the sand. Quite the opposite. Transposal under pressure will solve nothing in the long run. There are some States among the Fifteen that have obtained compromises on matters concerning their specific identity, and even among the founding countries of the Community, there are signed texts that are now being called into question again, such as the Stability and Growth Pact. The citizens of the Union, meanwhile, as you know, are contesting the acquis even more. The liberal structure of Europe, and the non-transparent way it is being created from the top down without the involvement of the people, is increasingly unacceptable. Such debates are also taking place within the candidate countries, at the highest levels. This is borne out, for example, by the essential conflict between the Polish Government and parliament and the Polish Central Bank, which is considered too liberal and too independent. For her part, the President of Latvia goes so far as to express her feeling, and I quote, 'of colonisation' within the population with regard to the Commission’s position on the agricultural chapter. You are aware of all that, yet you say nothing. I think that this is a mistake. You cannot bring down a fever by breaking the thermometer. There is another aspect that I would like to highlight. Our counterparts in the candidate countries have told me about some unfortunate incidents. Apparently, a Commission negotiator, when faced with a few reservations, settled the debate in substance with these words: 'either you sign, or you wait'. What is achieved by the arrogance of the strong towards the weak? You achieve a signature now and ill feeling later. That is not the solution. We need to talk about this. I shall simply note a third problem, since everyone is familiar with it, but I do think we need to talk about it because overall success depends on it to a great extent. This is the problem of funding for enlargement. If my memory serves me correctly, the Commission, in 1999, set aside EUR 40 billion for the period 2004-2006, when six countries were involved. The same sum is now set aside for ten countries. How can that work? And why are we not publicly reminding Member States which refuse the necessary financial solidarity that, over ten years, they, together with these countries, have benefited from an outrageous trade surplus of EUR 100 billion and that their companies are making substantial profits, the details of which we would like to know. Forgive me for being so frank, but our only chance of achieving successful enlargement in future is to address real problems now.

 Mr President, Commissioner Patten, President-in-Office of the Council, as we speak, there is reason to hope that the new war with Iraq will not take place. It is not absurd to imagine that the resolution currently in the process of being adopted by the United Nations Security Council could finally be drawn up to encourage disarmament in Iraq rather than to legitimise a military intervention there. That would be a great victory of wisdom over irresponsibility, but there is still a long way to go. And can we do anything, while the decision is that of the member countries of the Security Council? I am sure that we can, as it is clear that the requirements of our societies and the political initiatives taken by various States have greatly influenced the development of the positions of the main Heads of State, starting with George Bush himself. His goal was to change the regime in Baghdad. Apparently today the international community has only one possible objective, the disarmament of Iraq. He ordered the UN to either be on the side of the US or to stay on the sidelines. He nevertheless seems to understand that the framework of the United Nations is difficult to circumvent. He had put forward a theory of pre-emptive war. He now stresses that military action is not necessarily imminent or inevitable. Nobody is fooled. The American President has not given up any of his plans, but he is perhaps beginning to realise that international political life is not a western in which he can play the role of sheriff. I believe it is time to promote the mission of disarmament inspectors as an alternative solution to war. It was these inspectors who, until 1998, prevented Saddam Hussein from acquiring the atomic bomb and who destroyed stocks of chemical and biological weapons and their means of manufacture, military research installations, missiles and launch pads. Today, they say, their experience is greater still and their equipment more sophisticated. They are ready to start work again immediately. One of them, however, the American Scott Ritter, opportunely suggests that, upon their return, the embargo should be lifted. This mercilessly cruel burden was imposed twelve years ago on the population. My group, in conjunction with others, is going to take initiatives in this spirit, which you are all welcome to join. Furthermore, my group would consider highly useful a further declaration by the Council and the Commission on the new strategic doctrine published by the Bush administration on 20 September. I find it inconceivable that the European Union is silent on this text which magnifies what is described as the unparalleled force of the United States and emphasises their determination, to paraphrase, to act alone, if necessary as a pre-emptive measure, to extend the triumph of freedom. We cannot remain inactive in the face of the official confirmation of a doctrine which would undoubtedly lead to war in Iraq and which would lead to nothing less than the destruction of the collective security system set up around the Charter of the United Nations following the victory of democracies over Nazism. Lastly, we are still waiting for the beginning of the first stages of the implementation of the last parliamentary resolution on the Middle East. While George Bush draws the world’s attention to Baghdad, however, his protégé, who, not long ago, he classed as a man of peace even though he is violating all the resolutions of the Security Council concerning his country, is attacking the Palestinians with indescribable cruelty, thereby exposing his own people to a new infernal cycle of vengeance and hatred. Europe still needs to prove itself on all these points which, in fact, form a whole. The status of world player cannot be decreed; it must be earned. (Applause)

 Mr President, the speech by the President-in-Office of the Council on the Middle East gave me great cause for alarm, because there are, even so, few or hardly any regions of the world in a state of conflict that has such a profound impact on global stability. There are few regions in which a State breaches international law, humanitarian law and United Nations’ resolutions to such a degree and quite so repeatedly, and there is certainly no State associated with the Union which treats Europe in such an off-hand way, destroying Palestinian infrastructures that we have financed, which refuses, first Mr Solana, then Mr Moratinos, the right to visit an occupied Palestinian territory. And there is, above all, no State which treats the appeals that we make to it with such scorn, practically torpedoing the peace efforts on which we are working. It is in this context that the President-in-Office of the Council speaks of optimism and sees the main obstacle to peace to be the Palestinians. I cannot comprehend this! You are obviously right to condemn outright the suicide attacks and any act of terrorism against innocent people, in Israel just as in any other country. The Palestinian Authority also condemns them systematically and has often tried to put a stop to them. But what has Mr Sharon done during the last six weeks of relative calm to try to dispel the tension and re-launch the dialogue? The Ha’aretz
 newspaper answers for you, Mr President-in-Office of the Council, in pointing out that 30 Palestinian civilians were killed in August alone and Yedioth Ahronot
, another newspaper, condemned the irresponsible nature of these crimes, although, apparently, the number of terrorist attacks has fallen spectacularly. This is the truth, and it has to be told, Mr President-in-Office of the Council. Mr Sharon will not bring security and peace to his own people by re-occupying Palestinian towns, setting up yet more colonies, starving the population and destroying everything that can keep the hope of a State alive, particularly the hope of Palestinian Authority, and this is something being pointed out by many dignified and courageous people in Israel itself. What credibility can the Elsinore peace plan that you mentioned have, if you gloss over the root causes of the Middle East tragedy? What sort of tragedy might this reckless headlong pursuit of the strategy of force lead to, if all those who have some authority do not use all their influence to stop Ariel Sharon? You did not even demand an end to the siege of President Arafat or the withdrawal of Israeli forces. Does it not bother you that your position is a considerable distance from Commissioner Patten’s, for example? Europe must live up to the world’s expectations of it. Today, you unfortunately fell far short of them. (Applause from the left)

 Mr President, I think this is a matter of common sense. Anyone who follows my group’s activities knows how important the International Criminal Court is to us. After the events that have just taken place in Ramallah, however, with the bombing and besieging of the Palestinian Authority’s headquarters, this matter must clearly be our priority. The suggestion you have just mentioned, namely starting Wednesday afternoon with the statements on the Middle East, is therefore particularly welcome.

 Mr President, I am extremely surprised because the Conference of Presidents has – unanimously – asked the Council and the Commission to specifically include in this morning’s statement the issue of war crimes allegations in Afghanistan, which have recently been acknowledged by the UN. I am extremely surprised that nothing has been said on this issue, and I would like to ask you, Mr President, to ask Mr Haarder to expand on his statement so that it includes the subject that the Conference of Presidents specifically requested.

 Mr President, Mr President-in-Office of the Council, Commissioner, when my group invited the director Jamie Doran to show his film at the European Parliament on 12 June, we had three objectives in mind. The first aim was to gain as much recognition as possible for the overwhelming validity of the war crimes allegations made by the people interviewed by the British journalist in Afghanistan. Next, we wanted to give as much backing as possible to the idea of sending, under the auspices of the United Nations, a committee of enquiry to the region in question, with a view to establishing the truth of events. This would enable us to stop, hunt down and bring to justice the possible perpetrators of these atrocities, whoever they may be. Finally, we wanted to use this opportunity to reaffirm the need to respect the law and international conventions, in any situation, and this also applies to the fight against terrorism. The joint resolution which will be submitted to us tomorrow explicitly fulfils these three desires and this is an exceptionally encouraging outcome, even though, to achieve it, it will have taken a leading US magazine to confirm our statements and, in addition, the State department, the UN and, if not the Council, then a number of European leaders to speak more openly. We must now bring this episode to a conclusion and, furthermore, my group believes that we must learn some strategic lessons from it for the future. Personally speaking, I have no doubt whatsoever regarding the need for a consistent fight against terrorism, and I have never had one ounce of sympathy for the Taliban regime. It must be pointed out, however, that the military operations carried out by the United States or the West in Afghanistan, like the random detention of alleged Islamic extremists in Guantanamo or the compilation of ever-expanding lists of suspect organisations, have not enabled us to stamp out the al-Qa’ida criminal network. To some extent, this observation is based on the report that the anti-terrorist monitoring group formed by the UN sent to the Security Council today. On the other hand, the actions mentioned above have brought about inhuman and often traumatic consequences for the population, have without a doubt reinforced the most radical and extremist elements and, lastly, have increased insecurity throughout the world. That is why my group deeply disagrees with the passages of the resolution which seek to justify war as part of the fight against terrorism. If these paragraphs were to be adopted, many of use would unfortunately be unable to support this text. We must bear in mind that the subject of war has once again become a major concern in most of our countries. Unlike the sorcerers’ apprentices who, not so long ago, supported Islamic extremist networks in their attempts to destabilise whoever their enemy happened to be at any particular time, we are calling for responsible, on-going management of security issues; I am thinking, in particular, of the need to improve civilian conflict prevention and, if necessary, civil crisis management. The fact that al-Qa’ida cells still exist in at least 40 countries, according to the UN report that I mentioned earlier, also reminds us that terrorist networks are drawing their resources from the troubled waters of the international financial market. When will we finally adopt drastic measures to clean up and lend greater transparency to the international financial circuits where speculative – let us call it traditional – capital now mixes, if not crosses paths, with dirty money from organised crime? This is one of the costs of a genuinely effective fight against terrorism. For the time being, Mr President, it is clearly vital, as many of my fellow Members have said, that the international aid promised to Afghanistan at the Tokyo Conference be provided immediately so that the deeply scarred population – these people and, especially, these women – can, at last, begin to live once again like human beings.

 Mr President, over the weekend, 11 Palestinians, including 4 children aged six, ten and fifteen years old, were killed by the Israeli army during targeted attacks. According to the Israeli daily newspaper, Haaretz
, no less than 30 Palestinians were killed during the month of August. Sixteen other victims, including 9 children, had already been claimed during a raid on Gaza at the end of July. Even the Israeli press condemned the irresponsibility of these crimes while, as the Yediot Aharonot 
stressed, the number of terrorist attacks fell dramatically. That is why, on behalf of my group, I call upon the Council, the Commission and Parliament to adopt a very clear position on this change of tactic by the Sharon government, which, in my view, will incite hatred and the desire for revenge when there is a vital need for de-escalation, dialogue and peace.

Mr President, I was anxious to comply with the new rules governing the organisation of debates by drawing the conclusions myself on behalf of my group. Not everyone, I am sorry to say, has taken the same decision. I should like to make three observations. The first relates to the completion of the enlargement negotiations. I agree with what has been said about the timetable. Deferring or rushing the final stage of the negotiating process would have destabilising political consequences; in other words, the political price would be too high. I cannot agree, on the other hand, with what has been said about the Commission’s proposals regarding the agricultural budget and agricultural aid. Mr Rasmussen spoke of reasonable proposals, Mr Prodi of the “only possible basis”. We should be aware, however – and you are aware – that these proposals are seen as discriminatory in the countries of central Europe and as a danger signal from the European Union. Similarly, certain other economic aspects of established Community law and practice are considered by the people of those countries to be excessively severe restraints. One need only follow the political debate in Poland. The chosen solution does not seem to be the best way to create a more stable and united Europe, which is the aim of enlargement. My second remark, of a more general nature, could be summed up in the phrase ‘Be wary when things are too quiet’. Mr Prodi, your reading of the Eurobarometer has been selective. I believe you are clutching at straws. If there really is a broad consensus, why should strategic decisions be postponed until after the French and German elections? Why be afraid of the Irish referendum? In fact, as we all know, there is a great deal of friction between the European authorities and the people of Europe. I am convinced that this problem has to be tackled head-on and that the public must be given the opportunity to become far more actively involved in the shaping of European policy and, to this end, in developing a set of policies that can motivate and mobilise people and foster solidarity among them. This is a vital challenge that our Union must meet. Finally, I believe the debate has been very interesting in many respects, but it has been rather superficial on the role of the Union in the world. Let me cite three examples. Only a vague reference was made to Africa. At the G8 Summit, the action plan for Africa was mentioned, which the Africans estimated to be worth USD 64 billion. But no funds have ever been committed. In the European Union itself, the Cotonou Agreement has not yet been ratified by all fifteen Member States, so it cannot enter into force. We must step up a gear. My second example is the Earth Summit in Johannesburg and its implications for our entire planet. Here too, the preparations for the summit have come up against financial issues and run the risk of failure. What initiatives do you think the Union should take? My third example relates to the transatlantic links you cited, Mr President-in-Office, without a word on unilateralism or on the incredible decision made by the US Administration to hold the UN and the Balkan peace process to ransom in a bid to obtain immunity from international justice. I believe we ought to have heard your thoughts on all of these points.

 Mr President, High Representative, Commissioner, many of us here today visited Israel and the Palestinian territories during the last part-session. For some Members, it was their first visit. When one is on the ground and is able to listen to the evidence of the long-suffering populations, to assess the scale of the physical destruction and to guess how deeply the moral scars run, one can gain a better understanding of the meaning of the news that is now coming from the region. One can also grasp the significance of the vast demonstration that took place in Tel Aviv at the end of last week. Once again, ten of thousands of people assembled, which, given the size of the entire population of Israel, is an impressive gathering. They put forward very firm demands relating to conditions that must be met, namely the end of military occupation, of colonisation and of the despicable crimes committed by an army of a country that aspires to be a great democracy. At the end of April, we met the representatives of most of these movements in Tel Aviv. I feel that their work does Israel great credit. These groups, like the Israeli political leaders taking part in the coalition for peace led by the former Labour minister Mr Beilin, in conjunction with the Palestinian minister Mr Rabbo, embody the hope that things may in future change in Israel. The renewed strength of this current is, without doubt, the manifestation of some more profound changes which are surfacing within a section of Israeli society that seems to have strong misgivings about using the policy of force as a method of promoting Israeli security. There seems to be a greater degree of questioning, especially after the terrible revelations in relation to Jenin, about the consequences of the military offensive against Palestinian towns and camps in terms of Israel’s image around the world, and even about the possibility of international legal proceedings against Israeli leaders. Lastly, there is great interest in favour of the historic proposal from neighbouring Arab countries to return to good relations with Israel in exchange for a withdrawal from the occupied territories. It is most certainly in response to these signs that the extreme Israeli right wing members are behaving increasingly aggressively in order to reaffirm, in a deliberately provocative manner, their opposition to any prospect of a Palestinian State. This extremely dangerous policy is one that the Likud is stating in its resolutions and one that Sharon is exercising on the ground. His staunch opposition towards the Palestinian Authority and Chairman Arafat, his decision to systematically destroy the infrastructure and assets of the embryonic State established by the Oslo Accords, the construction, according to Peace Now, of 35 new settlements and the organised dividing up of Palestinian territories leave no doubt whatsoever as to the strategy being pursued, unfortunately with complete impunity. It is in this context that the European Union is gambling its credibility. I urge the Fifteen to consider this appeal from a young girl living in the Jenin refugee camp to a visitor who came to express his solidarity. ‘I do not want aid’, she said to him, ‘can you give me justice?’ Justice, of course, means reconstruction but it also means the end of impunity by the occupier and the end of the occupation, respect for international law, recognition of the two States and the guarantee of security of both peoples. This is the clear message that, on behalf of our peoples and the majority of the House, an official delegation made up of Members from Parliament’s highest level, should now take to Israel and Palestine.

 Mr President, Mr President-in-Office of the Council, Commissioner, yesterday, with 18 other Members of the European Parliament from six different parliamentary groups, I was in the refugee camp in Jenin. Last night, as we were leaving Jerusalem, when we found out that Ariel Sharon was opposed to a fact-finding mission to the Jenin camp, despite the fact that this mission would be UN-led and made up of such figures as the former president of the International Committee of the Red Cross, and the former High Commissioner for Refugees, we immediately understood the reason behind the new challenge that the Israeli prime minister had placed before the international community. A third of the town of Jenin, which last month still had a population of 15 000 inhabitants, is in ruins. Buildings have been blown apart, families gather together in the parts of blocks of flats which are still standing, seeing what remains of their houses collapse around them. In one part of the camp, a huge area stretched before us, where, just last month, dozens of three- or four-storey blocks of flats stood. All that is left of these are the ends of the metal scaffolding sticking out of the ground. It is difficult to know exactly how many bodies are buried in the rubble beneath your feet. A total of 47 bodies have been recovered from the debris so far. This figure will, unfortunately, have to be revised when a proper search can be conducted. The accounts given by inhabitants, backed up by shreds of evidence, are horrifying. Many of the soldiers, who surrounded the camp on 2 April, showed no pity for the civilian population, regardless of whether they were children, the elderly, the disabled or the injured. We heard of some shocking examples of this totally unacceptable attitude when we met the medical staff of the camp hospital who gave detailed accounts of the awful events. They told us that at 3 p.m. on 4 April, the army surrounded the hospital with 22 tanks. They said that they were told to stay where they were. The Israeli army general, himself a doctor, said that if an ambulance moved, they would fire. They opened fire on the Red Cross, which was trying to gain entry to the camp. The doctors told us that they were not allowed to save the injured survivors. A doctor, who asked for news of his mother, was told that she was injured and could not be seen. She was later found riddled with bullets. On the same day, the tanks attacked the hospital and destroyed an oxygen reserve. A doctor told us that to stop an injured man bleeding, whose throat had been pierced by a bullet, the only thing they had to hand was wire. They begged the soldiers to allow them to treat him. The doctor shouted that he would lose his arm and the soldier replied that he might as well lose his life. They took away the injured man and two other people, having waited for six hours in the sun. We do not know what happened to them. A young man came to the hospital to collect medicine for his mother. When he entered the hospital, a tank fired, injuring him. A nurse tried to pull him inside and was told that if she touched him, she would be killed. Then a soldier killed the injured man before calling the nurse forward to come and recover his body. There is a name for this sort of violence. It bears all the hallmarks of war crimes. This has nothing to do with the legitimate defence of the security of Israel. This is the reason why Ariel Sharon is now trying to do everything possible to prevent a UN-led committee from finding out the truth. On the front page of this morning’s Jerusalem Post, an Israeli official is reported to have said that ‘we are a sovereign country, we do not have to accept this type of command. It is better for us to suffer a few days of poor publicity than to live with the consequences of a biased report.’ The conclusion that we should reach, in my view, is that the international community must, first and foremost, remind these people of the difference between a sovereign country and an occupied territory. Then, we must make them understand beyond a shadow of a doubt that the age of impunity is over. There will no longer be just a few difficult days to get through. Sooner or later, Mr Sharon will have to explain his actions. Yes, it is time to react much more firmly. We must react, because if we fail to do so, we risk collusion with the unacceptable. We must react, it is all the more important to do so because Jenin is not an isolated case. We must ascertain what happened in all the towns which were re-occupied, particularly Nablus where further atrocities cannot be ignored. We must react, because impunity encourages arrogance. Many of our counterparts – Palestinian but also Israeli – including a Deputy Speaker of the Knesset, Mrs Chazan – have told us that they fear a possible attack on Mr Arafat’s headquarters. Furthermore, what consequences will result from the arrest of Marwan Barghouti, the Palestinian commander and MP? The situation in Bethlehem is still unresolved, although discussions are underway. Ariel Sharon has also announced the stepping-up of military operations in Gaza. He also stated that he did not contemplate the evacuation of any settlements. Yes, we must react, without waiting for a response – which is, unfortunately, hardly likely – from the United States, whose President is insulting the Palestinians and is making himself look stupid by depicting Mr Sharon as a man of peace. To respond and shoulder our responsibilities, must, I think, for us MEPs mean, apart from sending urgently needed relief, making an unwavering commitment to send the peacekeeping force, not to wage war but to contribute to peace. And this also means bringing to bear as much pressure as possible in the spirit of the resolution that we adopted two weeks ago on the members of the Council who are blocking the necessary revision of EU-Israel relations. And lastly, we must respond and shoulder our responsibilities, Mr President, as Europe's Parliament, something which directly depends on us. In this respect, I wish to repeat an appeal made to us by Abu Ala, the Speaker of the Palestinian Legislative Council. He said that it is in times of crisis that you find out who your friends are and that he will gladly receive an official delegation from Parliament as well as our President. In my view, the time has come to respond to this invitation and, at the same time, return the visit of Avraham Burg, the Speaker of the Knesset. We shall therefore clearly show that we are not criticising Israel but that we condemn Mr Sharon. What we want is a lasting peace with justice and dignity, because, for the first time since 1948, this prospect is being held out by all the Arab countries. It is an historic opportunity which we must not allow to pass by. It would be to Europe’s credit if it made every effort to save this unique hope. (Applause)

 Mr President, I have just returned from Jerusalem and Ramallah and I would, above all, like to support the principle of tomorrow’s debate, whether or not Question Time to the Commission has to be moved, although this is also an important part of our proceedings. This debate must be held in the presence of Mr Solana. My group and myself believe it is crucially important that the substance of our joint resolution provides a response to the unacceptably dismissive act of the Israeli Government with regard to Mr Solana and Mr Piqué, the representatives of the European Union, in other words. It is of secondary importance whether the vote takes place on Wednesday or Thursday. If I have to choose, I would prefer to take the vote on Wednesday for the reasons given by Mr Barón Crespo. But the main thing is that our position is unambiguous and is independent of the compromise reached and statements issued in Madrid.

 Mr President, on behalf of my group, I wish to fully support your initial comments and to express my own absolute condemnation of the appalling act of terrorism which has cast a shadow over Italy. Mr President, Mr President-in-Office, Madam Vice-President of the Commission, in some ways, the conclusions of the Barcelona European Council tell us more about the state of the European Union than any speech on the subject. Let me quote three examples to illustrate my point. As a rule, the annual spring summit of the Heads of State and Government of the Community of Fifteen stresses the social dimension of European integration. So what did the Barcelona Summit achieve in this respect? Mr President-in-Office, you mentioned the decision to put back the effective retirement age by five years. Another example is the solemn undertaking to respect the Stability and Growth Pact by limiting public and social expenditure and through wage moderation. Then there is the issue of introducing flexible working – what others might call precarious working conditions. Do you think our fellow citizens can accept this approach? Mr President-in-Office, what is your assessment of the progress achieved since the Lisbon Summit two years ago towards the target of full employment announced at that time for 2010? Are unemployment and poverty on the way to being overcome? Why did you not refer to the figures that the Commission itself has published on this subject, for example, the 60 million people living on the poverty line in the Member States after social transfers? What conclusions would you draw from this? What progress have we made so far with the implementation of the social agenda agreed in Nice? I would like to hear some replies that go beyond the extremely broad-brush comments contained in the conclusions of the summit. My second comment relates to the issue of services of general interest. We particularly note the call on the Commission to draw up a proposal for a framework directive on this subject. We will very closely follow the content and effective scope of this document. In that context, Mr President, on 13 November last year the European Parliament called for a rapid and precise comparative assessment of the real impact of the policy of liberalisation of services of general interest before embarking on further stages of liberalisation. What has become of that study? It has not been prepared and yet you have still driven forward the process of liberalisation. Are we to conclude from this that you have no respect for the specific requests of Members of Parliament and of Europe's citizens? Turning to the electricity sector, do you not have any lessons to learn from the fiasco in California or from the collapse of Enron? What is more, there are five countries operating in your own country, Spain, and all of them are private. The company that is most important in the Barcelona area, in particular, is incapable of guaranteeing supplies for its customers, and Catalonia was plunged into darkness last December. The chairman of another Spanish company has warned that worse is still to come. And just to put the tin lid on it, your government is about to pay these companies EUR 7.8 billion raised from Spanish taxpayers to help them prepare for even greater deregulation. Is that true or false, Mr President-in-Office? Is this the model whose widespread implementation is supposed to make the European Union the most competitive and dynamic economy in the world, to quote the rather high-flown and somewhat presumptuous phrases at present in vogue in our institutions? Finally, before, during and after the Barcelona Summit there was what "El País
" in its headlines rightly called a major demonstration in favour of a different kind of globalisation. And this was – this is my own point here – despite the unacceptable limitations that you imposed on the freedom of movement of hundreds of European citizens. In what way, Mr President, did you take into account this unprecedented call from our respective societies to leading European decision makers? It certainly seems that the motto of the European Union in Barcelona was based on the three words you yourself used to define your philosophy at a recent conference at the Estorial, if I may quote you: "liberalisation, privatisation and competition". This may make entrepreneurs’ and shareholders' mouths water, but it certainly will not appeal to most of our fellow citizens. That is because a good many of us have different ambitions for Europe, which involve offering the world an alternative to the liberalising, predatory and ruthless approach which underpins globalisation at present. We in my group and others fully support the demonstrations by the public, activists and trade unions which represent the new order the day. See you in Seville!

 Mr President, I should like to congratulate you on having made this statement, which is proof that you are fulfilling your duty. My group invited two high-profile speakers, one Palestinian and one Israeli, to address us here last night and they described life in reoccupied Ramallah. They told us how the camps were being bombed and also described the horrors of the attacks in Jerusalem. They told us how the city of Ramallah was plunged into darkness and bombed at the very moment when President Arafat was receiving Mr Moratinos, and how bombs fell just a few metres from where they were meeting. I think that you were right just now to recall our decision to invite President Arafat and Mr Peres. I believe that you are right to remind us of this and to extend the invitation. We also decided to send a high-level delegation to the area; this was Parliament's wish. I suggest that we act on this decision and that this delegation be a high-level one, comprising, for example, the presidents of our groups or even Parliament's President.

 Mr President, on behalf of my group, I would like to ask the Commission and the Council – and subsequently, Parliament – to issue an opinion at this part-session on a fact that has only recently been brought to our attention. As you are no doubt aware, this weekend the New York Times
 revealed that the Pentagon has a secret plan to authorise the use of atomic weapons against an ‘axis of evil’, which has been considerably extended on this occasion to include countries such as China and Russia. This constitutes one of the most unprecedented, irresponsible strategic about-turns since Hiroshima and Nagasaki, an almost inconceivable fact, which has, nonetheless, been confirmed by the American authorities. That is why we believe the European Union must react very firmly, at the required level, in response to this absolutely unacceptable shift by world’s leading military power, the only country, in fact, that has ever dared to use nuclear weapons.

 Mr President, I welcome this debate because I believe that Porto Alegre requires a firm response from the European Union. First of all, many people attending the world forum expect the European Union to cut its ties with the ultra-liberal model that provides a structure for the current form of globalisation. At the same time, however, Mr Aznar, in his capacity as President-in-Office of the Council, summed up his profession of faith for Europe in three meaningful words, which are – and I quote – ‘liberalisation, privatisation and competition’. We are still a long way from the requirement of sustainable development, from the requirement of promoting human abilities, in both the north and the south. Clearly, a consensus reached by the Fifteen to this effect at the forthcoming Barcelona Summit would constitute the most negative signal that the European Union could give to those I call ‘the people of Porto Alegre’. We can obviously disregard them and prefer to believe, like the President of Sun Micro Systems
 at the World Economic Forum in New York, that globalisation is a good thing and that nothing needs to be changed. I doubt, however, that he will be proved correct over time. Every era has provided such examples of short-sighted policies pursued by the ruling classes, who are too convinced of their beliefs and interests to allow a rebellious division to emerge that challenges its dogmas and status. We are all familiar with the episode in history where Louis XVI, King of France, wrote ‘nothing to report’ in his personal diary on the page dated 14 July 1789. I hope that the European Union will demonstrate rather more insight. Porto Alegre is also focusing the European Union’s attention on its responsibilities, in the face of the heightened and dangerous unilateralism of America under President George W. Bush. We cannot, firstly, expect the whole world to express its solidarity when one falls victim to a savage act of violence, and then, secondly, act according to one’s own agenda, and disregard every rule, principle and scruple. In a globalised world, the more powerful one is, the more responsibilities one has towards others and towards the planet. Ignore these responsibilities and globalisation becomes a minefield. I believe that the European Union’s primary duty is, in fact, to combat this very real danger. Yet, when it comes to its relations with the United States, one often has the impression that Europe is scared of its own shadow. For instance, on 8 February 2002 in Casares, the Fifteen had only just declared their clear position on the situation in the Middle East, when its major allies in Washington pathetically changed their stance a mere two weeks later. We must deal with this in a mature fashion; in other words, act independently and responsibly. This is what some of those who are legitimately challenging a predatory and inhuman system still expect of Europe. This year, at last, Porto Alegre firmly expressed a third demand which, despite the fact that its primary target is a military superpower, also concerns the European Union and its Member States. We cannot allow war to once again become a way to solve the world’s problems. We do not always know how war begins to become a part of everyday life, but we all know what it can lead to. From this point of view, I refer to what I said at the opening of today’s sitting on the incredible revelation in the New York Times
 regarding the existence of a secret plan at the Pentagon to authorise the use of atomic weapons. This extremely serious strategic about-turn goes hand-in-hand with the already exaggerated increase of the US military budget, an increase equivalent to the total amount of official development assistance of all the OECD countries. Mr President, Europe must respond, not by attempting to imitate the model, but by working openly with its fellow citizens on bringing to life the now emblematic slogan of Porto Alegre: ‘another world is possible’.

 Mr President, I would like to draw my fellow Members’ attention to the gathering, which is taking place right now opposite the Parliament building, of some 3 000 men and women from France, Italy, Belgium and elsewhere. They are calling on Europe to do everything in its power to bring about an equitable peace in the Middle East, in the spirit of the resolution that we ourselves adopted at our last part-session. I think that we must welcome this gathering, firstly because it is healthy, when we are discussing the future of Europe, to see so many people demonstrating to urge Europe to fulfil its role as a world player. And also because this is a demonstration for peace, justice and human dignity in the light of an appalling tragedy, which requires us to make an exceptional effort. I welcome the fact that most groups have agreed to hold discussions with the citizens’ delegations; this is promising. I think that the next step should now be to send, as we decided, an official delegation from Parliament to the Palestinian territories and to Israel, and also, once there, to organise a visit to Europe by President Arafat.

 Mr President, President-in-Office of the Council, Commissioner, when Turkey embarked upon a constitutional review process last autumn, my group immediately visited the country in order to initiate an in-depth dialogue with the government or the Grand National Assembly and with representatives of civil society. Unfortunately, we quickly became aware of the limits of this process. We were refused permission to visit Mrs Leyla Zana, the Sakharov prize-winner, and other former MPs of Kurdish origin, who are still in prison. Whilst the human rights organisations welcome every advance that is made, the sheer number of specific cases they deal with demonstrate how much work still needs to be done before we see the democratic Turkey that we all hope and pray for. We did not expect, however, to find out some weeks later from the President of the HADEP party himself, Mr Murat Bozlak, that he was summoned before the Constitutional Court to face a likely ban on the political party that he leads. In order to encourage the European Parliament to react strongly to this extremely serious and arbitrary development, we immediately invited President Bozlak to come and meet all the groups and proposed sending a parliamentary delegation to Turkey. I welcome the unanimous support for both these initiatives. The only crime that HADEP has committed is that of continuing to gain influence throughout Turkey, to the point where it is now guaranteed, if elections were to be held, that it would enter parliament, in spite of a specially made law, which sets a 10% minimum score for parties to be represented in parliament. I also welcome the fact that we decided, by means of a resolution which all the groups support, to send a clear message to the Turkish authorities, and the following statement, in particular: ‘The European Parliament calls for the case against HADEP to be dropped’. I therefore propose that together we undertake to ensure that this is done. It is the very least that we can demand of a country that will tomorrow be taking part in the Convention on the future of Europe.

 Mr President, during the debate held in preparation for the election of the President of Parliament, I had the opportunity to say what I expected of the new President. Basing my comments on the undisputed observation that the increasing numbers of citizens are showing a very worrying lack of interest in the European institutions, I said that the number one priority of the new President should be to do everything in his power to win back their confidence. I am therefore pleased to see that this objective is implicit in your programme. You said that we must win back the confidence of the people. We fully support you in doing this. How can this be achieved in practical terms? I myself have come up with three ideas. I think that two of them partly cover the same areas as your plans, but I would venture to say that the third idea could remedy a shortfall. The first idea concerns the involvement of citizens in the debate on the future of Europe. I suggested that our President launch, in parallel with the work of the Convention and in conjunction with the national parliaments, a campaign on the theme ‘Let your voice be heard’. This would be an incredibly bold experiment for our institution to undertake. We should stimulate a real confrontation of ideas, as you said, we should listen to what the people have to say to us on what they expect from Europe and strive to connect the Convention to the subjects of these diverse discussions. Then we should all face up to our responsibilities. We want the Convention to shake up the IGC, so let the citizens shake up the Convention! My second idea was for our President to take the initiative, along with ourselves, in organising meetings in Parliament of groups of citizens from various European countries to discuss common objectives that we could support. I mentioned three examples. The first is to organise meetings involving young people to discuss questions that directly concern them, such as Erasmus-type grants or the full and mutual recognition of qualifications, as well as broader subjects – we could call them more civilisation-related issues, like those that were recently discussed in Porto Alegre, under the alluring title ‘Another world is possible’. Another example is to invite women from all over Europe to meet and discuss the question of the full application of Treaty provisions that encourage equality. The last example, which is similar to your proposal, Mr President, is to organise meetings of members of civil society from the candidate countries and Member States to examine, together, the ins and outs of this quite historic undertaking and to give us the best possible chances of making it a success. In the same spirit, you proposed to invite observers from the candidate countries and we shall support you in this effort. The third idea that I mentioned two months ago is the only one that I fear was missing from the speech you gave this morning, and that is the idea of putting pressure on the Commission and the Council regarding several emblematic legislative texts that clearly spell out to our fellow citizens the direction in which we want to take Europe in the future. I am personally thinking, particularly at a time when so many businesses are undergoing restructuring, of the directives such as that on the information and consultation of workers, that on the European Works Councils, or even of the framework directive on services of general interest, and am looking forward to the possible – and, in my view, desirable – reform of the Treaties in this crucial area. The general approach advocated by my group and the many practical suggestions that turn it into a reality are the same as they were before your election and they will remain thus during your mandate. In this spirit, we will naturally be prepared to help you to make our Parliament a positive role model for millions of European citizens.

 Mr President, High Representative, I welcome many of the positions that you have clearly outlined, Mr Solana, particularly regarding the Palestinian Authority and its president. I also know that you are working in a creative and worthwhile manner with your many counterparts in order to encourage the prospect of a breakthrough in the situation. I also thank Mr Patten for his fair and forceful words on the subject of the destruction of infrastructures which symbolise the heart of the Palestinian State. I think, however, that the general attitude of the Fifteen is still greatly out of touch with the extreme seriousness of the situation in the Middle East. In my view, there is a great danger of seeing the majority of Palestinians lose their last hope for peace out of dignity. A nation that is submitted to this sort of daily humiliation by the occupying forces must never feel that the whole world does not care. We must therefore make ourselves heard. As Mr Poettering rightly pointed out, it is not normal for the head of a government to express regret that a man, recognised by the whole international community as the leader of a people and a nation, was not killed 20 years ago. What do we think of this? And how has Europe reacted to the dangerous green light given by President Bush to Mr Sharon’s policy under which he makes things worse in order to further his own ends? The rapport between them is as threatening as a violent storm cloud. Conversely, how are we interpreting the signs, a growing number of which is evident amongst the Israeli population, of a deep-rooted opposition to Mr Sharon’s policy on the basis of the fundamental requirement that the military occupation of the Palestinian territories must be brought to an end? I am thinking of the courageous statements made by Mr Avraham Burg, Speaker of the Knesset, who believes that a nation of occupants will end up being disfigured by the crimes of occupation. I am thinking of the 300 men and women who travelled from Israel to Ramallah this weekend to deliver a message of peace to Mr Arafat. I am thinking of the appeal launched by 52 Israeli officers and soldiers to no longer agree to fight in order to occupy, deport, destroy, blockade, kill, starve and humiliate a whole nation of people. The latest opinion polls reveal a profound distrust of Mr Sharon’s security policy and almost an absolute majority in favour of peace with the Palestinians. Do such facts not give us more room to manoeuvre than those that we use to significantly heighten the tone when faced with the irresponsible attitude of the current head of the Israeli government? What are you intending to do, Mr Solana, in this area, to support the forces of peace in Israel? Lastly, practical measures are as important as fair words in diplomacy and these measures are now expected from Europe. One of the very significant initiatives, such as the one I proposed to you in an open letter that I sent last week, and the essence of which Mr Cohn-Bendit has just partly taken up, could be to invite President Arafat, and possibly Shimon Peres, to the European Council and to the European Parliament and, if Mr Sharon dared to defy the European Union by using force to prevent our guest from travelling, to organise a joint visit by the 15 Foreign Affairs Ministers to Ramallah and to clearly express an opinion on the conditions that, in Europe’s view, would secure a return to peace. I believe that it is of utmost urgency to give, in one way or another, those who support dialogue and peace on both sides the prospect of a breakthrough, which they vitally need. Simply by doing this, you will present – and I know that this is your desire – Europe with a task that rivals its greatest ambitions. (Applause)

 Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, my friends and colleagues of the Confederal Group of the European United Left – Nordic Green Left nominated me as a candidate as this is an extension of my work as the Group's chairman. For two and a half years, I have tried, as chairman, to help to bring to life a specific type of politics for Europe. It is this approach that my candidacy illustrates. One of the main characteristics of my candidacy is its firmly left-wing stance. In my view, European leaders are not drawing lessons from the worrying disaffection of the citizens towards the European institutions. There is growing concern on the ground surrounding employment, social welfare, public services, and sustainable development, whereas the Council and Commission are focusing more attention on deregulation, commercialisation, and solely market-related issues. I think that we must take a clear stand on this contradiction. In the same way, one of the salient features of our time is the aspiration of social actors to be involved in the decisions that concern them. However, within the institutions, undertaking consultation before drawing up policies and, more importantly, assessing their effects after implementation remain largely formal, even non-existent processes. We cannot stand back and do nothing about this discrepancy which many believe manifests itself in the crisis of confidence that we are currently experiencing. Lastly, the topical subject of globalisation is mobilising the public on an unprecedented scale. We will see this once again in a few days’ time at the World Social Forum in Porto Alegre. But the Europe of today has neither the ambition nor the resources to meet the global expectations for alternatives. We must take action. A number of us here, in addition to my own Group, think that if we do not make sweeping changes, Europe will disappoint us greatly. If nothing changes, the historic opportunity that enlargement presents could turn out to be a fearsome trap. We must make ourselves heard and seize every opportunity to do so. This particularly applies to the quintessential political day of reckoning that constitutes the first round of the ballot for the presidency of Parliament. Another aspect of the political approach that I have tried to adopt since the beginning of the legislature, and which I hope my candidacy demonstrates, is the will to avoid dividing the progressive MEPs according to their political culture that is often assumed for reasons to do with history and the specific identity of each nation, each political culture being therefore equally worthy of respect. Within my group, then, staunch federalist Members sit alongside and cooperate with Members who are deeply attached to the sovereignty of their country. Both represent a part of the real Europe. We must design and build the European Union of the future by working together and with mutual respect. This is a difficult task but it is necessary and, in my experience, ultimately worthwhile. That is another characteristic of my candidacy. Last but not least, I will mention one last characteristic; namely that there is a specific set of ethics in politics. I welcome frankness, transparency and honest relationships, even between opponents and, more importantly, between partners. Therefore, I have no hesitation in saying that I value my opponent, Mr Cox, on a personal level, and even that I welcome the courteous relationship I enjoy with a number of fellow MEPs on the right, including their main representative, Mr Poettering. Thankfully, there are other things in life apart from politics. Nonetheless, I must say, equally clearly, that the candidate common to all these political families cannot, in any circumstances, count on my vote or on my support, direct or indirect, in the following rounds of the ballot. I should like to affirm this and I shall do so. On this point, I would like to express my surprise and regret at the extremely disappointing attitude of those Members who did not waver in their campaign on progressive issues in the first round, yet, in the second round, offered their vote to the only candidate of the Right, who has been dubbed the candidate from a small group, especially for the occasion. Each Member is entitled to his or her own principles and methods; these are most definitely not mine. Mr President, the cards are now on the table and it is up to us to shoulder our responsibilities.

Madam President, it is no secret that neither my group, on the whole, nor myself, played a part in electing you two and a half years ago. The reason for this is that, as far as we are concerned, for democracy to function properly, the pluralism characterising our societies must be properly expressed. I am, however, speaking completely from the heart when I say that both my group and myself truly appreciate and have a great deal of respect for your Presidency. You have given us proof of your impartiality, your respect for all political sensibilities, even minority opinions, and your ability to avoid political discrimination. This has not always been the case in this Parliament. Your attitude in this regard is worthy of a special mention. You have also been able to adopt difficult positions, for which you deserve credit, when the fundamental values upon which the European Union is founded have been called into question. A great deal of courage was required to adopt such positions, which you proved to have. Although, generally speaking, we have not always supported your public statements, because they put forward the majority view of Parliament, which, unfortunately, on too many occasions is so different from our own, you have nevertheless been able to give a dignified image of Parliament. One of the highlights of your Presidency has to be the outstanding Sakharov prize ceremony that you so wanted and that you were able to expand on through your wise words in your speech at the Laeken European Council. For all of this, and for the excellent degree of cooperation between us, thank you very much! (Applause)

 Madam President, Mr President-in-Office of the Council, President of the Commission, I have already had the opportunity to say that, in my view, the passion of any European politician should be, in the short term, to narrow the gulf of suspicion, if not distrust, which continues to grow between the citizens and the European institutions. My group therefore welcomes anything that can help to open up our respective societies to the debate on the future of Europe. This is why we sincerely appreciate the principle of the Convention, which is a departure from the typical intergovernmental behind closed doors meeting, as it involves European and national members of parliament in the preparatory work of the IGC, and allows representatives of candidate countries to participate. It is also open to contributions from social players. Rest assured that we will urge our counterparts from civil society to work in a constructive and open manner in the new, European political forum. Let us hope that those whose desire is to avoid tackling the disturbing issues that have surfaced in our societies will not be supported by the majority of the Convention. A problem cannot be solved by ignoring its root cause. That is why I thought the current state of affairs described in the draft declaration that Mr Verhofstadt submitted to the European Council was interesting, because it corresponds exactly with what our fellow citizens are experiencing, but the Fifteen unfortunately decided not to take it on board. On the other hand, I regret that the Presidency-in-Office of the Council has not shown the same critical attitude when preparing the questions submitted for discussion. Of course, the European Council did not find fault with any of this. The two vice-chairs of my group, Mrs Kaufmann and Mrs Frahm, will speak again with regard to the specifically institutional aspects of the Laeken Summit. As far as I am concerned, I would like to stress one single idea in relation to this. If we genuinely wish, as the Declaration by the Fifteen stated, to use citizens’ expectations as the main theme of our imminent reflections, then, in my view, the debate cannot fail to include the institutional questions of the European project, the political guidelines that the institutions are supposed to implement. Anyone who has taken part in citizens’ debates within the framework of the pre-Laeken consultation, or has taken the trouble to listen to the messages that came to light recently in the large demonstrations that took place in Brussels, will have in mind those urgent demands which are practically absent from the Convention’s agenda as defined by the Laeken Declaration. For example, all social issues, in the widest sense of the word, should provoke discussion on the new role that the euro and the European Central Bank will play. It should lead us to examine more closely the conflicting ideas on European services of general economic interest. It should lead us to question the dogma of rationing public spending, to re-launch the debate on the taxation of movements of capital, to stimulate the will to put an end to fiscal dumping and tax havens. The European Union’s economic policy should no longer be limited to competition policy, nor should its monetary policy be aligned with the demands of the financial markets alone. In my view, the question of the effective rights of employees facing the might of large corporations, and that of the effective involvement of citizens in drawing up European policies and the assessment of their effects are also an unavoidable topic from this perspective. All these questions, which we are bearing in mind, make up an institutional dimension. They have a place, therefore, in the debates of the future Convention. The same applies to enlargement. Can the institutional challenge posed by this historic event be separated from the other critical problems that we should urgently prevent? Two figures are all that are needed to illustrate what is at stake. We remain silent about these figures when we should be confronting them head on and with total responsibility. By 2004, the European Union’s population will have grown by 30%, but its GNP will only increase by 4.5%. What sort of structural reforms, and, in particular, what type of solidarity policy will be needed in order to avoid dangerous tensions, to enable us to become what the Laeken Declaration calls a big European family? Lastly, the few lines that this framework document devotes to the CFSP can be summed up almost exclusively by – and I quote – ‘updating the Petersberg tasks’. As if Europe’s ability to wage war was a guarantee of its international authority. Having had the opportunity over recent weeks to visit several regions of the globe, I can say that this is not the most important thing we are asked to do. What people want from Europe is liberation from oppressive American imperialism, to drive back much more aggressively the rule of unilateralism, to develop a wide-ranging strategy of conflict prevention by meeting the needs of development, equality and dignity of the people of the south. In short, they want Europe to give a very different perspective on events, post-11 September, to that of George Bush. Let us have the courage to look at life as it is. Let us once again give a clear and inspired meaning to Europe, and I think that this will liberate the institutional dynamic. This, in any case, is what I believe.

 Madam President, Minister, Commissioner, I had just returned from a memorable trip to the Palestinian territories and Israel when I heard the news of the terrible carnage in Jerusalem, followed by a second attack in Haifa. I was horrified by these deliberate and cruel acts of murder and I immediately expressed my deepest sympathy to the families of the victims. I stressed that no cause can in any way justify the killing of innocent people. Those responsible must be arrested, tried and punished. You do not have to be a genius to understand that these latest crimes are disastrous for the Palestinian Authority. During my visit to the region I was able to appreciate the difficulty in containing the exasperation of the people, especially those living in the refugee camps, in the face of the daily violent attacks by the occupying forces, and especially after the irresponsible assassinations of the long-established leaders of the fundamentalist groups. I thought to myself, if the Israeli Government has decided to take revenge for the victims of attacks in its own way, the Palestinian Authority’s remaining small margin for manoeuvre will be greatly reduced. It would then become almost impossible to break the terrible vicious circle of humiliations, attacks, reprisals and revenge which the conflict has been in since the election of Ariel Sharon. Now this has all come true, and how terribly! Israel has wreaked revenge on the fundamentalists in a barrage of fire targeting Arafat. The Palestinian police force, charged with arresting Hamas and Islamic Jihad activists, has itself been bombarded. International Human Rights Day was marked in Hebron by the intolerable image of two children aged three and 13 blown apart by an Israeli missile that missed its suspect target. Who can now doubt Ariel Sharon’s desire to destroy the Palestinian Authority and all that remains of the Oslo process? What is Europe saying in the face of the very real danger of the total annihilation of the Palestinian nation and the overwhelming tidal wave of the fundamentalist reaction that would follow? Do we condemn Sharon’s policy of adopting the worst possible line? Are we encouraging those courageous people in Israel who are calling for the resumption of negotiations? Are we congratulating the Palestinian Authority on its first arrests of fundamentalist activists, at some risk? Do we deplore the death of Palestinian civilians as much as we deplore the death of Israeli civilians? Do we at least repeat our long-standing call for international observers to be sent to the region? However unbelievable it may seem, none of the points I have mentioned appear in the European Union’s press release. On the contrary, the European Union has sent a message to the Palestinian Authority, whilst the press has highlighted the unprecedented severity of its tone. Now the only hope rests on strong political intervention from the international community. At this time, it would be a tragedy if Europe were to turn a blind eye to the situation, and do nothing to stop George Bush from giving the green light to Ariel Sharon. I think of the men and women of Israel and Palestine, who, like our Sakharov prize-winners Mrs Peled-Elhanan and Mr Ghazzawi, are counting on us to support their resistance, their hopes and their work towards a just peace. Their struggle must remind us of our responsibilities. (Applause)

 Mrs Durant, Commissioner Busquin, let us not disguise our pleasure at once again hearing the sound of music on the streets of the Afghan capital and a woman's voice broadcasting on Radio Kabul. It does us all good to read the sense of liberation on the faces of the Afghans and the rout of some of the most obscurantist and cruel oppressors the world has seen. Let us however, without further ado, take a good look at all the aspects of the situation today, to make sure that our hopes are not soon overshadowed by a new nightmare. Firstly, the fighting is, alas, not yet at an end. The Taliban have regrouped in southern Afghanistan and near the border with Pakistan, where they will go to any lengths to try to save, at whatever price, the remnants of their power and capacity to inflict harm. It would be a disaster if they managed to gain support for their deadly cause from Pashtun groupings, who might feel rejected by the new leaders of Afghanistan. As for the various rival factions that make up the Northern Alliance, we must beware of idealising them. The way women are treated in some of the provinces under its control gives real cause for concern. Furthermore, its past conduct, only five years ago, and the disturbing information we have received from Mazar-i-Sharif unfortunately suggest that there is a risk that sooner or later they will embark on a bloody settling of scores in the reconquered territories. Experience shows that what were once effective aids to military action can turn into serious obstacles to a political solution. From the outset, the political issue has been the determining factor. Secondly, we must look at the distress of the Afghan people, exhausted by five years of terror, months of drought and misery, followed by five weeks of intensive bombing. The UN estimates that seven and a half million people are at risk of famine in this devastated country. In fact, Mr Lakhdar Brahimi, the UN Special Representative, has repeatedly called for a rapid end to the war for this very reason. What the country does need, however, is emergency aid and development aid on a large scale. For let us not forget that international opinion was mobilised specifically in order to neutralise the terrorist networks, to cut off the sources, mainly financial, that feed them and also to destroy the social and political breeding ground on which they thrive. To date, we have certainly not achieved this just and ambitious aim and any failure to find a political solution to the Afghan problem would only take us further from attaining it. This explains the role that an international player such as the European Union, and particularly the UN, must fulfil through its Member States, as well as within the framework of our relations with the American leaders and with the countries of the region. This will enable a political solution to be found that comes from all sectors of Afghan society and from Afghanis who, until now have been the chief victims of the Taliban, must now be among the agents of change. It is high time this martyred population was offered stability, dignity and peace.

 Thank you, Madam President, for your words of solidarity for Algeria at the beginning of the sitting. It is said that you find out who your true friends are in times of need and I believe, in fact, that now is the time to show our alliance with the Algerian people by providing substantial emergency aid of various kinds to help them contend with the extensive damage caused by the torrential rain that has struck Algiers and northern Algeria. A natural disaster of this kind is always a huge blow for any population, particularly the most deprived, but, in this case, Algeria is also a country that has already suffered so much due to Islamic terrorism, economic and political crises, which continue to dash everyone’s hopes. My group is, therefore, calling on the European Union to make the necessary resources available to help those affected by the disaster and, secondly, we believe that we must draw lessons, and not only in conjunction with the authorities and Parliament, but also with the relevant representatives of civil society in Algeria, from this tragedy and define priorities for our future cooperation. If I may, Madam President, I would like to briefly give some information about another subject, since the request to add this item to the topical and urgent debate was rejected, that of the case of Leïla Zana. The Bureau of my group recently held a meeting in Ankara. We requested the opportunity to meet the Sakharov Prize winner, of course, but we were refused outright, and what we find particularly disappointing, especially since this concerns the Sakharov Prize, is that we were unable, at a time when we are combating terrorism, to meet Leïla Zana. I think that it was only fair that my fellow Members are given this information and I also hope that the Commission is aware of this information since the Commission is currently drafting a progress report on relations between Turkey and the European Union.

 Madam President, Mr President-in-Office of the Council, President Prodi, the four weeks that passed between the Extraordinary European Council of 21 September and the Ghent Summit of 19 October were filled with events of strategic importance. In what ways did the Fifteen analyse these events? In the meantime, the targeted response, for which the Member States had already declared their support the month before, has escalated into real war, causing wide-spread devastation, civilian casualties and distraught people heading for the borders. On numerous occasions, targets have been missed, with refugee centres, hospitals, residential areas and even Northern Alliance positions being mistakenly attacked. The ultimate goal of these operations, which are being stepped up, is becoming increasingly blurred as each day goes by and their vague strategy is startling. There are growing protests…there is mounting criticism…the feeling of unease is spreading, including amongst fervent supporters and key allies of a consistent fight against terrorism. What is our objective? Do we sincerely believe that this is the way to win the necessary fight to close down these criminal networks and deprive them of their fertile breeding ground? How does the European Council view this development, that is worrying to say the least, particularly in the wake of the announcement that American soldiers will soon be deployed on Afghan territory, and even more so because both Ramadan and winter are almost upon us? Well, the European Council – and I quote – ‘confirms its staunchest support for the military operations […] and […] notes that these targeted actions are in accordance with the conclusions of the Extraordinary European Council meeting on 21 September 2001.’ In some ways, therefore, there is nothing new in this statement…I am saddened and concerned by this attitude, as it almost puts Europe out of the running altogether, at a time when much is expected of Europe, of a political Europe, not of a military Europe, and of a Europe which, admittedly, has expressed solidarity with the United States in tracking down these terrorist networks, but failed, however, to provide unconditional support for the unilateral choices made by those in Washington. In the weeks before the tragic events of 11 September, the European Union had, in fact, begun to play a role on the international stage, in the Middle East, in Macedonia, at the Durban conference on racism, and the EU knew how to make a mark on events. This was also true on the day after the attacks, when Europe supported the most realistic and responsible movement within the Bush Administration, helping to do away with the worrying concept of a crusade in order to set up a global coalition on an unprecedented scale. Unfortunately, since military operations got underway, the European Union has been acting as if it were paralysed. The new global situation means proper intervention by Europe is more pressing than ever on some crucial issues that are at the heart of the current world crisis, and most importantly, on the Middle East question. Mr Verhofstadt briefly touched upon this point and Mr Prodi came back to the issue: the European Council statement rightly reiterates that the UN resolutions must be respected in order to find a lasting solution to this conflict; the US leaders themselves now seem to agree that Mr Sharon’s policy is feeding the spiral of violence and is a fundamental barrier to peace. Now then is the time for straight talking before things once again spiral out of control and thus give another chance to those who fish in troubled waters. No one is better placed than Europe to give fresh hope to the forces of peace in the region. I believe that this should now be our overriding ambition.

 Madam President, I had the opportunity to express my views on this matter before the Conference of Presidents meeting. I do not feel that now is the time to argue about this, or to have a dispute over procedure. In my view, I am extremely pleased that the Conference of Presidents had virtually unanimously agreed to award the Sakharov Prize to Mr Ghazzawi and to Mrs Peled-Elhanan, who, to my mind, symbolise what many of us aspire to, in other words, to give hope to those who wish to find the path of dialogue and peace in the Middle East, a region that has been so afflicted. From this point of view, Madam President, I think that, and the European Council also gave this message, in other words, that we request Ariel Sharon’s government to respect international law and withdraw his tanks and troops as a matter of urgency from the autonomous Palestinian territories, I think that it would certainly be in the spirit of the Sakharov Prize for you, Madam President, if you agree, to give this message to the Israeli government on our behalf. Thank you, Madam President. (Applause)

Madam President, I would like to know if it is possible for each group to very briefly explain how it voted on this draft regulation. I am sure you will understand. This is an agreement that has been reached between all the groups. Madam President, I would simply like to say that, of course, it goes without saying that my group is, completely and unequivocally, firmly opposed to terrorism and, therefore, in agreement with the principle of the Commission’s proposal of depriving these terrorist organisations of their funds. However, my group finds the method imposed on us unacceptable, in other words, having to decide urgently on a list that was sent to us by the United States without explanation... (Applause)
 ... and which could be changed outside our control. This is why we cannot, unfortunately, approve this draft regulation as it is today. (Applause)

 Madam President, to continue on the same theme, in the wake of the events of 11 September, Parliament gained a very broad consensus on the need to quash any equation of Islam with terrorism, substantiating the unacceptable and dangerous theory that this is a clash of civilisations. On the other hand, we recall Mr Solana’s words, spoken in the same spirit, who had advised – and I quote – that we must not create a rift, as this would be a huge mistake. Mr Berlusconi’s astounding and deeply shameful words show how important it is to issue a very clear response. First of all, we must strongly condemn the age-old rumour of the purported superiority of Western civilisation and Christianity. Then, we must decide upon an initiative, along the lines of Article 7 of the Treaty of Nice, enabling the Council to determine that there is a clear risk of a serious breach by a Member State of the fundamental principles of the European Union and to address recommendations to that State. I therefore suggest, Madam President, that the Conference of Presidents examines what significant political action we would be advised to take in this matter. (Applause from the GUE/NGL Group)

 Madam President, Madam President-in-Office of the Council, Commissioner, my group and I believe, in the wake of the terrorist attacks in New York and Washington, that the need to see the European Union display its character and show how useful it can be in world affairs has never been so great. The coming period – perhaps the next few days – will certainly provide it with the opportunity to display its determination and ability to face three challenges, in particular, which are posed by this tragic situation. I believe that the first challenge will be for countries to decide to be willing partners of the United States. At yesterday’s debate in the Committee on Foreign Affairs, Human Rights, Common Security and Defence Policy, one of my colleagues spoke of ‘allied but not aligned countries’. This does not mean, of course, that they lack the necessary and legitimate solidarity, particularly in the common fight to seek out, judge and punish those responsible for this act of barbarism or, more generally, to break up the terrorist networks. On the other hand, this means that we must have the courage to make clear to our American counterparts what we are perfectly willing to do and what do not sanction under any circumstances. Yesterday and this morning, Mr Solana quite rightly stressed that it is vital that our fight against terrorism is not perceived by those in the Arab and Muslim world as a war against their civilisation, or even as a crusade, to use one of the most alarming expressions of President Bush. Yesterday, the High Representative for the CFSP already recommended, in the same spirit, that we should be careful, that we should seek to humiliate nobody, avoid any confusion and not create rifts, which would be a huge mistake. I welcome these responsible words. My group hopes that these words will be translated into an outright refusal by the European Union to allow itself to be drawn into wartime thinking, into a trap which would produce more bloodshed and more innocent victims. The second challenge that we must face is directly related to what I have just said. We must avoid creating a division, but also review and revive the Euro-Mediterranean relationship. Now is not the time, in my view, to discuss free-trade zones with our partners of the South-Eastern Mediterranean. We should instead talk about development, political dialogue, how to bring our societies closer and about human dignity. And one of the practical commitments to make in line with this strategic choice is primarily to take concerted action to resolve the Middle East conflict fairly. I appreciate the efforts made by Mr Solana and all the European Union representatives in the region. These efforts are bearing initial fruit but we can all see that this situation is extremely fragile. This is therefore the time to make every endeavour to work not against but in partnership with the United States and other actors, particularly in the region. I believe that the third challenge we face is that of working on a new approach to international security. Does the tragedy of 11 September not illustrate the failure of the way in which the world has been managed since the fall of the Berlin wall? There are so many unresolved conflicts! There are so many powerful but hidden forces at work! There are so many destabilising forces! Pursuing a unilateralist approach is not a response to this deep-rooted evil. We should combat it with genuine cooperation on a global scale which respects the spirit and letter of the United Nations Charter. Taking military action or clamping down with law and order is not the way to respond. We need an ambitious and multi-faceted policy for crisis prevention. Citizens everywhere – in Africa, in the Mediterranean, in Latin America, in Eastern Europe, in the United States itself and often in the Member States – expect to see a revision of world governance. At the moment, Europe, in particular, is being called upon to do this. This is an opportunity to be seized. From this perspective, the coming days could be the moment of truth.

 Madam President, Mr President-in-Office of the Council, Mr President of the Commission, none of us, in fact, have the words to express the feelings aroused by the terrorist attack of unprecedented barbarity with which the United States has just been hit. The American people is going to have to live through a deeply traumatic experience which is likely to become still more intense as the scale of the disaster they have just experienced becomes more apparent. In this unimaginable ordeal, they must be able to count upon our unqualified solidarity. I would add that, if these faceless monsters targeted the United States yesterday, they will be able, tomorrow, to bring terror and death to any region of the world, including, of course, the European continent. Madam President, my group therefore fully supports the declarations you have made and the steps you have taken on our behalf. These dismaying attacks constitute a challenge to the whole of the human community, a challenge we are now going to have to learn to take up. I say ‘learn’ because, if we all agree that the guilty parties must be found and punished, we are obliged to acknowledge that, where every other aspect of the matter is concerned, more questions than certainties arise out of the tragedy of 11 September 2001. In my view, nothing would be more inappropriate, indeed more dangerous, than to react to this radically new phenomenon with well-worn notions whose limitations have just been cruelly demonstrated. After an outrage of this kind, there may, in other words, be a great temptation to call fervently for violent retaliation which would, however, have immeasurable consequences. What is more, you are right, Mr Poettering. It would do no service to the cause of peace to allow criminal fanatics to be confused with entire peoples, a number of whose representatives have, sometimes with much dignity and in a deep spirit of responsibility, indeed just expressed both their radical condemnation of the terrorists and their solidarity with the American people. Finally, and in more general terms, no one must forget ever again that we are all part of the same world. Even the strongest nation of all is not invulnerable. The entire international community is sentenced to confronting together the great problems facing the planet – the oceans of frustration, the great divisions that are opening up and the negotiations that have broken down – and to cooperating as closely as possible in the search for long-term solutions. That is undoubtedly the decisive contribution that Europe can make to the world in order to join in taking up the challenge to civilisation facing us. (Loud applause)

 Mr President, I was not present at the debate because I was attending the Conference of Presidents, but someone came to tell me that a member of my group, Mr Miranda, was literally the subject of verbal aggression on the part of another Member.

 Madam President, Madam President-in-Office of the Council, Commissioner, the morning after the G8 meeting my group, which was very much present in Genoa, immediately called for this debate to be entered on the agenda of this new session of Parliament. The conservative majority in this Parliament, which is feeling very defensive, prevented this debate from concluding with a resolution in which Parliament expressed its opinion. It will not, however, manage to prevent us from raising the serious questions arising from the events at Genoa again and again on our political agenda, in one form or another, throughout the coming period: the aftermath of Genoa is only just beginning. One of the issues raised by Genoa is the very legitimacy of G7, or G8, perceived as a kind of board of directors of the big powers of this world. I will not go into that today. Another issue raised by Genoa is, of course, this whole problem of violence, in particular the unheard-of repression of peaceful demonstrators, who were pursued even to the headquarters of the Social Forum of Genoa. Yesterday we took the initiative, in association with the Green Group, the Attac association and socialist MEPs, of organising a major debate on the subject with the coordinator of the Genoa Social Forum, Mr Agnoletto. The extremely grave incidents that were discussed and described during that debate made us even more convinced of the need to shed full light on the course of events that led to the dramatic incidents and acts of violence we saw and on the entire chain of responsibility for respecting the rules and values in which the European Union believes. For the rest, I proposed that we set up a monitoring committee right here to work in liaison with Italian members of parliament, the Social Forum in Genoa and other partners who wish to help discover the whole truth of the matter. In the same spirit, we have reiterated our support for players in the social movement who do not want to see their message be perverted by acts of violence of the Black Block 
type, which our enemies find easy to manipulate. We will not allow this magnificent commitment on the part of our citizens to be discredited, let alone criminalised, in this way. That brings me to the third, and perhaps in our view the principal issue of the aftermath of Genoa, namely the political responses we will or will not be able to make to the questions asked by these men, these women, these innumerable young people who are quite wrongly labelled anti-globalist, whereas most of the time what they seek is a democratic globalisation based on solidarity. At a time when the European Union is debating its future, its ambitions on the world stage and its relations with civil society, we for our part do not see these questions as a threat to be averted, but far more as a chance we must seize if we want Europe to move forward.

 Madam President, the Middle East is currently experiencing its darkest period since, or even before, the signing of the Oslo Accords. Madam President-in-Office of the Council, in this context, it does not make much sense to talk of a policy of impartiality. We are not taking sides against Israel by condemning outright the policy of its current government. This was a policy that the statesman Yitzhak Rabin had the insight and courage to turn his back on, an action which cost him his life. Sadly, now that all prospects of a just peace for the Palestinian people have been dashed, bloody attacks are being made on innocent Israeli civilians, which exceed the boundaries of legitimate resistance by an occupied people. These intolerable actions only serve to increase the hatred and feelings of vengeance. A vicious circle was precisely what we feared most in the event of Ariel Sharon’s election, and this is what we are now caught up in. I support the comments made by Commissioner Patten. We must concentrate on doing all we possibly can to help to find a way out of this impasse that is causing so many deaths. In this spirit, and I repeat what Mr Barón Crespo has said, we can only welcome with great pleasure and profound admiration the eminently dignified and courageous work that a group of key figures, both Israeli and Palestinians, ministers, members of parliament, writers and lawyers, carried out this summer. The outcome of this collaboration was the publication of a joint declaration in which they made a commitment to work together, on the basis of principles that are acknowledged by the international community, to restore trust and hope in peace. In conjunction with the laudable efforts of our diplomatic staff, I propose that we lend our support to this initiative by using all the resources at our disposal, by inviting, for example, the two main players – the former Israeli minister, Yossi Beilin, and the Palestinian minister, Yasser Abed Rabbo – or by awarding them the Sakharov Prize, or even by setting up a European committee to support their joint declaration. In doing so, we shall, in our capacity as the European Parliament, be making a real contribution to peace. Thank you in advance. (Applause from the GUE/NGL Group)

 Madam President, my group fully supports the suggestion to conclude our debate on Genoa by a resolution. I do not propose, however, that we should enter into a debate on the content of this resolution. That is something for the various groups to do. My group believes that Parliament must deliver an opinion on the results – or the lack of results – of the G8 summit, as well as on the extremely serious events which took place during the summit, and on the extraordinary success of the initiatives of the Genoa Social Forum, which also concern us at a time when we are involved in a far-reaching debate on the future of the European Union.

Madam President, Mr President-in-Office of the Council, Mr President of the Commission, I appreciated the fact, Mr Verhofstadt, that you frankly acknowledged what you rightly called an ‘identity crisis’ in Europe between the citizens and the European Union, and that you stressed the need to take their aspirations seriously so that, as you said, we can bring the citizens closer to Europe. It makes a change from the all too frequent speeches designed to mollify, which people can no longer listen to because of all the contradictions that are glossed over. It is only natural that new issues will arise from experience, which call for changes, innovations, and sometimes a questioning of matters that were believed to be done and dusted. No subject should be taboo – we must acknowledge the problems, as you stressed. In this spirit, I would like to mention a few issues that surface increasingly often in the debate provoked by the changes that are now affecting the European Union. I believe that these issues should be raised as part of the exchange of ideas that you are hoping to promote during your presidency. We have been repeatedly told, for example, that the eurozone was shielded from the major repercussions of the economic slowdown in the US. We must now admit that, unfortunately, this has not been the case. This is quite a serious misdiagnosis. What sort of analysis is being carried out? What sort of lessons in economic and monetary policy must we learn from this, so as to avoid the European economy becoming entangled in the American financial bubble that is now about to burst over us? I would reiterate that, over six years, there has been a nine-fold increase in the amount of European capital flowing to the United States which, last year, reached over USD 220 billion. There is another example that Mr Duisenberg himself sometimes uses – in contrast to the US Federal Reserve, which is required under its mandate to promote employment and growth, the European Central Bank is not required to deal with these problems, which are indeed at the heart of all of our concerns. Do the European citizens know this? And what do they really think of this, when in fact unemployment is on the increase and growth is in decline? Should we not give some thought to this subject? I have another example – the Stability Pact requires Member States to rationalise their public and social spending. If we merely follow this policy over the coming months, will it not lead to an economic slowdown, at a time when we actually need to stimulate growth? In what way can we revise the usual criteria or the way in which they are implemented in order to overcome this contradiction? Generally speaking, the fundamental question that the new, and rapidly deteriorating, economic circumstances raise and indeed force us to consider is, in my view, the following: what sort of political creativity can we come up with in order to avoid serious tension arising in all our societies even between some of the Member States, and, more importantly, with the candidate countries? This question cannot be answered by some sort of project to elect the President of the Commission by universal suffrage. I think that we will have to attack the hard core of the neo-liberal model, which pervades European integration to an excessive degree. I also think that we are going to have to listen as well as involve the social actors and citizens in this necessary change. Mr President-in-Office of the Council, I would like to know how courageous and daring the Belgian presidency, which you have launched today, is prepared to be in this area?

 Madam President, three months ago, in this very House, I had the opportunity to express my thoughts regarding Mr Milosevic. In my view and, I believe, in the view of the large majority of my group, Mr Milosevic is largely responsible for one of the worst tragedies the Serbian and other peoples of the former Yugoslavia have ever known. (Applause)
 Mr Milosevic had to answer for his crimes and had to face international justice sooner or later Admittedly, the circumstances surrounding his transfer to the International Criminal Tribunal sullied the historic step forward that this move represented. From this point of view, I feel a sense of frustration, not so much because a judgment of the Constitutional Court of Belgrade – the legitimacy of which is doubtful – was breached, but rather because the dignity of the democratic forces in Serbia and Yugoslavia was violated. These forces have been forced to split in the face of financial pressure from a great power which, moreover, itself rejects the principle of an International Criminal Tribunal. Nevertheless, we still demand to see Mr Milosevic answer in full for his crimes and I am dismayed to hear a member of my group speak in his defence and, furthermore, make statements in the press which I personally feel are unacceptable. (Applause)
 In our view, men and women who were wrongly imprisoned go by the name of Nelson Mandela or Leïla Zana  prisoners of the past and the present. The values for which they are fighting are at the other end of the spectrum to the objectives pursued by the former leader of Belgrade. (Applause)

 Madam President, Madam President-in-Office of the Council, President of the Commission, it is too soon for any exhaustive analysis of the Irish ‘no’ to the Treaty of Nice. Yet it is possible to make a few comments on it without too much risk of being mistaken. The first concerns the official reactions to this bombshell, which took all the leading European figures by surprise. In Luxembourg this Monday, the ministers apparently devoted half an hour or so to this event, which one of them described as merely a hiccup. That is what I would call burying one’s head in the sand. Surely the minister must realise that this rejection represents a new and serious symptom of the crisis that is profoundly undermining European integration. Nearly three quarters of the Irish population said ‘yes’ to the Community when their country joined in 1972 and today the same proportion is refusing to say ‘yes’ to the EU Treaty of Nice – yet the national and European leaders did not even see it coming. We are facing a problem that looms far larger than Nice and Ireland. There were other warnings of the Irish ‘no’, in particular the growing rate of abstention in nearly all the EU countries at the European elections. In my view, and this is my second comment, that ‘no’ vote is first and foremost the price of building Europe without the citizens and at a distance from them. Where are the wide-ranging public and pluralist debates, at which everyone lays their cards on the table, on the issues at stake, the difficulties to be overcome, the values to be upheld and, finally, on the political choices that need to be made completely transparently and democratically? There is one example that has a direct bearing on what happened in Ireland. At the summit, the states concocted, at breakneck speed, a defence Europe with imprecisely defined missions and which public opinion, in general, regards as unlikely to be independent. They often glorified this new achievement in tones that the neutral countries in particular, although others too, perceived as militaristic. So this backlash is hardly surprising. The same applies in other areas, especially the economic and social area. What are we to think of those leaders of the richest countries who nonchalantly cultivate the net contributor syndrome and raise the spectre of the renationalisation of agricultural aid and the Structural Funds, thereby fuelling the pernicious ‘each for himself’ trend? At the same time, the federalist overstatement of the ongoing institutional debate has played its part in creating confusion in countries that want to protect their place, their role and their identity in a future large complex of which they can perceive neither the nature nor the contours. Added to that, there is the less than engaging spectacle that the Fifteen offered the public in Nice, so that it is not surprising to find a general feeling of disenchantment if not the return of a populist and inward-looking trend. That brings me to my third and final comment on a question everyone is asking: what should we do now? First, in my view, we must respect the rules of democracy. Whether we like it or not, the Treaty has not been ratified unanimously and we will have to make some improvements to it. Next, this time we would do well to hold an in-depth debate with the citizens of all our countries on the kind of Europe to build and on the political, institutional and financial implications of our decisions. Lastly, we must not let our opponents, who are ashamed of enlargement, use this crisis as a pretext to defer to an unknown date this pan-European project that is potentially great and splendid, but is obviously also complex and costly. Here too, we need a responsible debate so that we can evaluate, in the clear light of day, the conditions under which we can all succeed. Just as there can be no ambition without effort, there can be no European project without solidarity.

 Madam President, first I want to thank Mr Ferber and Mr Schmid for not using this incident to score political points. I am also very sorry such an incident could have occurred. I immediately found out how these people were able to get into the Chamber. A Member in my group has apparently been mislead in this matter. I can vouch for my colleague’s good faith. He obviously never wanted anything like this to happen. What did happen was that three people (Applause)
 asked to be received because the mother of one of them is one of the hunger strikers in Turkey and is in a critical condition. My colleague agreed to meet them in his office and it was when he was saying goodbye to the delegation that he failed to keep an eye on them and these three people were able to get inside the Chamber. My colleague – whom I informed immediately – has sent me a letter this morning explaining the facts. He expresses his dismay and apologises to the House. I shall be handing this letter to you, Madam President. I want to say that I am all the more distressed about this incident because I do not think it serves the cause of the men and women who are dying every day in Turkey at this moment, and I believe that is the real tragedy. (Applause)

 Mr President, Commissioner, on behalf of my group, I insisted that we should have the opportunity to hold this debate in light of the tidal wave of restructuring programmes announced in countries across the Union. It is particularly timely today because, following the recent mobilisation of employees from the Danone group in Calais, the employees of Marks [amp] Spencer are now holding a large European demonstration in London. In the eyes of the public, Marks [amp] Spencer, following its decision to close 38 shops and to make thousands of employees redundant has, like Danone, come to represent one of the most abhorrent symbols of the strategy known as ‘shareholder value’, of shareholder law and of the social irresponsibility of major companies. This is the eighth time since the Michelin affair in October 1999 that I have spoken in Parliament to warn the Council and the Commission of the urgent need to confirm the social responsibility of companies and to establish meaningful rights for employees. Until now, we have merely received evasive answers extending the due date and the long-awaited revised directive on informing and consulting workers has been our Loch Ness monster: everyone has been talking about it but no one has seen hide nor hair of it. The European public is now demanding practical and meaningful measures. I feel that as far as the workers who are affected and many other people are concerned, the Union has staked part of its credibility on this issue. Therefore, Commissioner, I would like you to give clear answers to three questions. First of all, a draft, revised directive on informing and consulting workers has existed since 1998. You mentioned it yourself and it is cautious and to my mind, quite inadequate. Nevertheless, the Council, to this day, refuses to review it. If I have understood you properly, Commissioner, you are going to push for the Council of 11 June to override the veto exercised by the United Kingdom, Ireland, Denmark and even Germany, whose Chancellor has just tried to pass himself off as a European visionary. You also intend, if I have understood correctly, to introduce a system of penalties for companies who breach the directive’s provisions. Have I understood correctly? My second question is this: the directive on establishing a European works councils dates back to 1995. To this day, only a minority of companies concerned has implemented the directive. Incidentally, these bodies are basically talking shops without any real power. The Nice European Council stipulated that this directive should be revised, and I quote, ‘by 2002’, which would require setting the procedure in motion immediately. I feel that the Commission’s working programme for 2001 ignores this problem. Why is this the case, Commissioner, and what do you intend to do now? Do you plan to give this future works council real prerogatives, such as the right to suspend a restructuring plan and the time to examine an alternative project to the one laid down by the management? Lastly, and with this point I shall conclude, the European Parliament has declared itself to be in favour of systematic verification that social and employment obligations are being met by every company that benefits from Community aid. Parliament has also requested that, each time the Commission makes a statement on a company merger plan, it makes its assent conditional on the employees’ rights being respected. What are your plans on this matter?

 Mr President, Madam President-in-Office of the Council, Commissioner, we seem to have reached a turning point in transatlantic relations. First there is the legacy of the Clinton era. Even if we leave aside the serious trade differences, the emblematic banana dispute, the beef hormone dispute, the GMO dispute and a dozen others that are being or have already been examined by the WTO, we can see that in recent years, Washington had already shown growing signs of unilateralism, one of the stigmata of the superpower complex. Opposition to the Treaty banning anti-personnel mines, opposition to the Charter on the Rights of the Child, opposition to the establishment of an International Criminal Court that might, one day, have to judge an American citizen, a casual approach to politics and financial blackmail of the United Nations, an economic blockade, in fact a military operation that violates international law, the Echelon affair, the Colombia plan – the list is endless. Moreover, we have hardly had a chance to hold a dialogue with our transatlantic interlocutors about certain decisions that Europeans regard as shocking in a civilised society, such as the death penalty and the refusal to grant universal access to medicines to combat AIDS. Yet we have to admit that the Bush Administration’s first decisions have a more serious impact than anything we have ever seen so far. We were concerned enough when we heard the new President’s advisor on security, Mrs Condoleezza Rice, describe her vision of the new distribution of labour between Americans and Europeans for the maintenance of peace in the Balkans, when she pointed out with as much perspicacity as elegance that it was not the GIs’ job to take children to nursery school. Frankly, we can only describe the refusal to sign the Kyoto Protocol and the promotion of the missile defence shield as irresponsible, not only towards Europe but towards mankind as a whole. In view of this escalation, are we condemned to pro forma
 protests before settling for realism? I think not. A Europe that is open to dialogue but adheres firmly to the principles of a civilised and responsible international community will find allies among the public opinion of the five continents and even in the US Congress and among a number of states. Commissioner, of course we are not trying to promote a sense of anti-Americanism or indulge in aggressive rhetoric towards a partner who is indispensable in today's world. We simply want to set out the clear political resolve of the Fifteen and their united front towards objectives that could meet the expectations not only of Europeans but of all those, in whatever part of the world, who wish to free themselves from the unipolar system in which they are increasingly being confined.

 Mr President, as you know, today is the eleventh World Press Freedom Day. Many of our fellow Members would certainly wish to take this opportunity once again to state their solidarity with this struggle, a struggle, furthermore, which is proving successful, because, according to the Reporters sans Frontières
 association, fewer journalists are being imprisoned and fewer media outlets are being censured than a year ago. Nevertheless, the list of sources of pressure and oppression against journalists is a long one. Amongst the states which ‘Reporters sans Frontières’ accuses, such as Burma, Syria, China, Ethiopia, Tunisia and many others, we can now increasingly add various mafias, terrorist groups and fundamentalist movements. Just in the last few days, we were saddened to learn that Brice Fleutiaux, the French reporter who had been held hostage for several months in Chechnya and on whose behalf we intervened, was unable to overcome the depression that affected him as a result of his incarceration, and took his own life. I therefore believe that this Day must be an opportunity to give impetus to our collective commitment to this essential element of democracy.

 Madam President, am I right in assuming that the item on Turkish prisoners on hunger strike has not been included in today’s agenda?
Wurtz (GUE/NGL

 In my view, this answer, not the one you gave, Madam President, but the answer given by the Council, is unacceptable and we should not accept it. (Applause from the left)
 When I wrote to you on 25 April, you were, in fact, in favour of this yourself. I believe I am right in saying that all the political groups were also in favour of this. At that time, 17 prisoners had died. Since then, there have been a further two deaths. A further 160 prisoners are in a critical condition. I think that the Council’s response to postpone this debate to some other later date is an unacceptable, bureaucratic answer. We cannot allow the number of victims of the hunger strike to increase with each passing day, nor can we shirk our responsibilities. If, as I understand it, the Swedish Minister for Justice will be present at this sitting to talk about the Cashman report, one cannot imagine that he would refuse to respond to our request, in other words, to send the Turkish government an urgent request to resume negotiations with the prisoners’ representatives so that this dreadful slaughter can be brought to an end.

 Madam President, in response to what Mr Cohn-Bendit said, I would just like to say that personal actions are to be admired as long as they are for a good cause. This does not mean, however, that an institution is in any way exempt from carrying out its responsibilities. This must not, in any way, then be used as an excuse by the Council, which should do what we ask by tomorrow at the latest.

 Madam President, I had no intention whatsoever of speaking on this issue, but since the debate has been sparked off again…(Heckling)
. Please be a little more patient! You can tell me what you thought of what I am about to say in a moment. You may even be slightly troubled by this. Madam President, since the outset, the Members in my group believed that this was a matter involving a string of events that are all the more worrying and harmful since they evidently relate to a political issue, the scope of which is clear to all to see. I am clear at least about one thing – and that is the political responsibilities used quite openly in this matter – namely, the prolonged silence, and then the delaying tactics used by the Spanish government for more than eight months since the matter was referred to it by your office, Madam President. I think that we cannot help but associate this attitude with political collusion with Mr Berlusconi. That is what is unacceptable. We must not accept it. As for everything else, the more we have out into the open, the better it is for our institution, and, in my view, and I want to state this personally and very clearly, I do not question the integrity of the President of this Parliament, even though I do not approve the course of action she chose to follow in this sensitive matter. I know only too well what courage you have shown in other circumstances, Madam President, and therefore I will not go accusing you of anything underhand today. On the other hand, we have asked for complete transparency from the outset and you helped to provide this earlier by giving the details of this matter. It was just so that the whole truth could be known by all, and possible misunderstandings avoided, and most importantly so that we could finally make up some lost time to look into this request for the waiver of parliamentary immunity. I hope that the precedent of the Council of Europe that you mentioned – the Council of Europe to which the Spanish government felt it could turn – will enable you to persuade the Spanish government to treat the European Parliament in the same way as soon as possible, so that we will finally be able to look into this issue and turn the page on this chapter.

 Mr President, I had the pleasure of taking a delegation of Members from my group, firstly on a visit last month to the Former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia and then last week to Bosnia-Herzegovina, Serbia and Kosovo. We, the vast majority of my group at least, have returned with an even greater conviction that the European Union cannot exist without south-eastern Europe. In our view, the European Union must therefore provide itself with the economic, political and institutional resources necessary to implement a strategy that would allow us to include these peoples and nations, if they so wish. We believe that the Stabilisation and Association Agreement concluded between the European Union and the Republic of Macedonia plays a part, albeit a modest one, in achieving this. It was signed on 9 April 2001 and was ratified by Parliament just three weeks later, and in my view, this agreement represents a step forward for Macedonia, the region and the European Union. It is a step forward for Macedonia, since, in addition to the considerable funding provided by financial aid worth EUR 62 million since the beginning of this year and the opportunity to export its products to the fifteen countries of the EU, free from customs duties, the political significance of this agreement is a decisive factor. It symbolises a commitment given by the major Macedonian political forces, both Slav- and Albanian-speaking, to encourage political dialogue, without any acts of violence being committed between the various ethnic communities. This agreement encourages taking steps towards establishing equal rights and equal opportunities for all citizens and opens up the prospect of unification for a society that is threatened by instability, signs of which can be seen on a daily basis. This is a step forward for the region, which we should no longer call ‘the Balkans’, since this is a term widely rejected for its painful connotations. For the region, the fact that Macedonia was the first country to sign this type of agreement is an incentive to take inspiration from this model of inter-ethnic cooperation, which is imperfect, but nevertheless groundbreaking. We should remember that the Deputy Prime Minister, the Minister for the Economy, the Minister for Justice, the Minister for Labour and Social Policy, the Minister for Local Self-Government and many deputy ministers in Macedonia are Albanian. Finally, it is a step forward for the European Union itself, which has experienced so much difficulty in making a success of its common foreign policy, and the fact that the EU is able to play a truly constructive role in this important country should be seen as an encouraging sign. So, we must continue to make good progress. Other similar agreements must be signed in the same spirit with Croatia, Yugoslavia, Bosnia-Herzegovina, Albania and the next step should be to accept their candidature for joining the European Union. Even if each country understands that the path leading from their application to actually joining is part of a process, the conditions for an active partnership already exist. My group, in any case, has decided to make a determined effort to achieve this.

 Madam President, Mr President-in-Office of the Council, Mr President of the Commission, other members of my Group will be speaking on various aspects of the Stockholm European Council. For my part, I shall stick to just one subject, which should, in principle, have been central to the work of the summit: the subject of employment. The ink was not even dry on the final declaration by the Fifteen, in which you reiterated, and I quote, ‘the goal of full employment’, and in which you welcomed the initiatives taken by businesses to promote corporate social responsibility, when suddenly, like a bombshell, came the announcements that 1 780 jobs were being axed by Danone and that Marks [amp] Spencer were closing all their stores outside the United Kingdom. These are just the latest examples, so far, of shareholder value, in other words, shareholder law, and just like Michelin, Ericsson, Nokia, Telefonica and so many others, they illustrate everything that is no longer acceptable. I ask you this, Mr President-in-Office of the Council, what are you going to do about these company directors who so brazenly thumb their noses at your declared intentions? The Commission, you write, in the conclusions of the Stockholm Summit, and I quote, will ‘present in June 2001 a Green Paper on corporate social responsibility’ and will ‘encourage a wide exchange of ideas with a view to promoting further initiatives in this area’. All well and good, but will you now, in the light of these new facts, be defining precisely what the Commission’s mandate will be? And will we, Parliament, be waiting, arms at the ready? I suggest that we should decide to create, perhaps within the Committee on Employment and Social Affairs, a new permanent body – let us call it a ‘subcommittee’, since that is the sort of language we use – which will be responsible for monitoring the strategies of major companies in Europe, a subcommittee open to contributions from trades union organisations, works committees, consumers’ associations and elected representatives. We could thus help to create, at our level, an effective monitoring device, which would be able to put some meat on the bones of the intermediate employment objectives that the Stockholm European Council has just set itself. We already know who the first employees will be: those of the French agri-food group that I have just mentioned, whose shareholders have just seen a 17% rise in the net profit from their shares, and those of the British chain whose shares have just gone to blazes on the London stock exchange. If we ourselves take action to demolish the divine right of the big companies to sack people as they see fit, we shall, after all, be doing nothing more than defending, by our actions, a European project that is worthy of the name, and a Parliament that is closer to the people. (Applause)

 Mr President, Commissioner, Mr Costa Neves has produced an important report on the 2002 budget guidelines. Unfortunately, however, I have to point out that there are a number of inconsistencies in the report. The first inconsistency is in the choice of priorities: social issues, which are the focus of our citizens’ expectations, are not included; employment, a subject to which the European Council said it intended to devote the recent Stockholm Summit, since this is obviously one of Europe’s core challenges – Mr Pronk and Mrs Gill mentioned this point earlier – does not feature prominently enough in the list of priorities; and enlargement, a seminal ambition if there ever was one, is also missing from the list of priorities. To tell you the truth, I do not understand. There is also an inconsistency in the report between the stated objectives and the financial resources provided to achieve them. Therefore, although it is, of course, right to focus on food safety and financial support to the agricultural sector given the consequences of the BSE crisis and of foot-and-mouth disease, this intention seems to me to be inconsistent with the commitment made to maintain budgetary discipline, along with the absence of any cost estimate of the BSE crisis and given the rejection of my group’s proposal to create a special reserve for BSE grants. Mr Virrankoski also highlighted this problem. The final inconsistency, which is of a more general nature, is in this tendency to look at every one of the European Union’s political ambitions primarily from the point of view of cutting back on expenditure. The rapporteur says that we must prepare for the reform of the common agricultural policy, bearing in mind the forthcoming round of negotiations within the framework of the WTO and the implications of enlargement. We know what that means. As for the EU’s external policies, the rapporteur insists that performance targets first need to be established. What true significance can such a request have for the Balkans, the Middle East and for our partners in the southern Mediterranean, if not the prospect of cuts or redeployments in various programmes, due to an unacceptable cost/effectiveness ratio? With regard to pre-accession expenditure, the rapporteur again stresses that we need to examine closely whether this is effective in terms of the convergence of the applicant countries’ economies with those of the Member States. A word to the wise, however. Only one chapter seems to find favour with the rapporteur and that is the one on European defence. In his opinion, and in his opinion alone, he alludes to the idea of a revision of the financial perspective, the taboo subject of all the previous debates on the budget. That is certainly one of the reasons why a third of the Members within the Committee on Budgets immediately refused to approve this report. In fact, given the enormous hurdles currently standing in Europe’s path, we cannot afford to duck underneath them.

 Madam President, I have to take the floor, although I regret to have to do so after a Member of my group has spoken. First of all, I believe that I am expressing the feelings of the greater part of my group when I say that it was necessary for Milosevic to be arrested. (Applause)
 Furthermore, I believe that his arrest is not a snub towards the people of Serbia and Yugoslavia. Instead it is a relief, because it enables this people, this nation, who certainly have a very honourable and often glorious history, as well as an extremely troubled recent past, to turn the page once and for all on this extremely troubled recent past, at a time when the whole world is watching. My last point is to say that, on the other hand, I think the pressure that the American leaders are putting on the new leaders of Yugoslavia is extremely misplaced, irresponsible and dangerous. I think that you must be aware of what you want. If you want to refuel nationalism and give food for thought to those nostalgic for the past, do so. However, if you want to give Serb and Yugoslav democratic powers a chance, allow them to bravely take on their responsibility and see things through to the end. (Loud applause)

 Mr President, Commissioner, I fully agree with what Mr Onesta has just said. For too long now our parliamentary assistants have worked without being protected by a statute. Although the vast majority of Members of Parliament have guaranteed them correct working and salary conditions, it must be acknowledged that the practices of a number of our colleagues has somewhat tarnished the image of the European Parliament. The lack of control and transparency in the management of secretarial allowances paved the way for abuse. And, as Jacques Loyau, President of the Association of Assistants, deplored at the time, in the absence of a safeguard, everything was possible and there were considerable disparities. A survey carried out by the Association of Assistants more than a year ago highlighted a worrying situation. Fourteen per cent did not have a contract of employment; 12% had only external consultant contracts, even though they worked full time, and 53% did not have any social cover or accident insurance. This survey served as the basis for the action taken by the parliamentary assistants and their Association, which our group supported from its beginnings. Some initial results were obtained within the European Parliament with the adoption, by the Bureau, of the amendment to Article 14 of the rules on the costs and allowances of Members of Parliament. As our President, Nicole Fontaine, stressed at the time that the matter of the assistants had made significant and concrete headway and that the transitory measures which had been adopted reflected the will and determination of the European Parliament to move towards greater transparency and fairness in this area.. These measures, which came into force on 1 January this year, have indeed enabled us to strengthen our control over the use of the secretarial allowance and to guarantee each assistant a contract of employment, health insurance and occupation accident insurance. This progress, which has been made thanks to the perseverance of the Association of Assistants and to the efficient work of our Vice-President, Gérard Onesta, served as a base for our negations with the Council. However, as we have heard, for months now, despite our best efforts, this matter seems to have been deadlocked. I am therefore very interested to hear that an agreement has been reached in principle between the Commission and the European Parliament to amend the free movement of workers regulation along the lines the assistants would like to see. I welcome this. It seems that the way is now clear for us to be able to move forwards very soon towards a European statute whereby, in the words Parliament chose in its opinion of 11 March 1999, assistants are treated equally and in accordance with the work they carry out.

 Madam President, if I speak now, I will not speak again on behalf of my group, so I shall kill two birds with one stone. I will not repeat what my fellow Member, Mr Lannoye quite rightly said – I wholeheartedly agree with him. I spoke to you, Madam President, on this very same subject at the beginning of the month. I think that we should respond to three requirements which advocate including this issue on the agenda for this part-session. First of all, there is a requirement for timely action. This is actually an issue that directly relates to Community life and which was raised last month, most fortunately, by the Temporary Committee and its rapporteur, Mr Gerhard Schmid. We cannot, therefore, wait until September and for the Temporary Committee’s report to discuss this, as some Members are proposing. The next requirement is for the truth. In the answers provided by Commissioner Patten and the Temporary Committee’s rapporteur, Mr Schmid, the explanations contradict the statements made by the official involved. We therefore need an explanation and we need it now, not in September. Lastly, I shall mention the requirement for Parliament to maintain its credibility. Mr Lannoye reiterated the point that the media has already latched onto this affair and if we decided not to discuss it when questions are raised and not to give the facts in response, we would, more or less, be seen to be on the defensive and suspected either of wanting to cover something up or of being inconsistent. In order to avoid running this risk, I think that the best thing to do is to include this item on the agenda.

 Madam President, Mr Poettering has often spoken out, in this very House, against personal attacks on other Members of Parliament. I have always respected him for this attitude, in spite of our conflicting political beliefs.

I think that it would do credit to him if he refrained from making such unwise comments in the future.

 Mr President, Mr President-in-Office of the Council, Commissioner, I was one of the Members who had requested that a debate on the bombings of Baghdad by the United States and Britain be included on the agenda of this sitting. I did this in the same spirit as when, at the Conference of Presidents, I suggested that Mr von Sponeck be invited to attend the European Parliament. He is the former coordinator of the UN oil for food programme who had the courage to resign from his post in the light of the appalling consequences of the Washington-inspired strategy in Iraq. My conviction, which is shared by everyone in my group, is that the European Union has everything to lose if it is tentative or indecisive in this matter and everything to gain if it takes a clear stand. I believe that the latest air raids on Iraq illustrate with startling clarity what is at stake. I believe that the main thing at stake is our approach to international relations. These air raids on Baghdad are, in essence, totally illegal, deeply counter-productive and ethically unacceptable, as were the previous raids that have taken place since Operation Desert Fox in 1998, which is recalled with some horror. They are in direct opposition to the principles that we stand for. None of the UN resolutions provides for this sort of use of force. These continued bombings have enabled Saddam to get rid of any international inspection of disarmament measures. Lastly, whilst Saddam Hussein is continuing to tighten his control on Iraq and his neighbours, most of society, on the other hand, is utterly devastated and is suffering terribly. This alone should be enough to put the European Union on the offensive so that it can help Iraq escape its shameful, dramatic downward spiral. If it fails to do this, the Euro-Mediterranean partnership might as well be dead and buried – it has already been heavily compromised. Secondly, I believe that the nature of relations between Europe and the United States, led by George W. Bush, is also hanging in the balance following this new series of bombings of Baghdad. Let us remember that Iraq is one of the ‘rogue’ states, which the US Government uses to justify its antimissile defence programme. The new US Administration undoubtedly wants to test the vulnerability of the EU by playing the Iraqi card again, in order to quash or, at the very least, to soften Europe’s opposition to the National Missile Defence programme, that irresponsible strategy championed by the White House. In my view, the third and vital thing to be endangered by the European reaction to the British and US bombings is the credibility of the European project itself. Basically, this is because it is unusual for one of the leading Member States, one of the pillars of what some call the vanguard or hard core of the future Union, particularly in terms of security and defence, to commit itself instantly to support of Mr Bush. Today, the political affinity that existed between Mr Blair and Mr Clinton is no longer even applicable. This can no longer be termed the ‘third way’ – these actions blatantly overstep the mark. We have already said this about the Echelon affair. Nonetheless, at a certain point, choices have to be made. It is impossible to be in two places at the same time. What a poor example to give to the leaders of the applicant countries, who are encouraged to make gestures to the more powerful countries rather than to contribute to a common project with their neighbours and partners! Poland has already given Washington its support, but it is virtually the only country in the world to do so. Is this what we really want to see as we prepare for enlargement? That is why, Mr President, although I welcome the odd criticism made here and there in the European Union about the bombings, I believe that we need a much more willing attitude from Europe towards the whole Iraqi issue, which could be achieved by providing, if need be, a kind of enhanced cooperation by most of the Fifteen, including considerable support to the democratic opposition in Iraq and the lifting of the embargo.

 Mr President, Commissioner, Representatives of the Council, all we are debating is an Amending Budget, but look at the wealth of strategic issues it raises. First and foremost, there is a gulf between the Commission’s own diagnosis of the anticipated cost of the BSE crisis and the funding plan before us. I should like to repeat Mr Fischler’s point of view, as published in Le Monde
 one month ago to the day, which said that the costs of this crisis will be huge, even in the best case scenario where consumption would not fall more than 10% in 2001 and where our exports would be maintained. Intervention buying alone would have a budgetary cost of EUR 3 billion. One month later, consumption has fallen by 27% and exports have halved. Yet we have been proposed a budget of a little less than EUR 1 billion, or a third of the estimated minimum costs. This budget deficit gives a spectacular insight into the major political deadlocks that are provoked by a steadfast and increasingly intolerable refusal by the majority of the Fifteen and the Commission alike to consider even the slightest change to the Financial Perspective, even if this would lessen the effects of such a serious, unexpected crisis. In the medium term, my group is certainly in favour of far-reaching reform of the common agricultural policy, a reform that would put an end to spending all the budget on illegitimate funding of agribusiness which centres on high productivity and is dangerous to human health and to the environment. We want to see a CAP that no longer sends millions of animals to the incinerator; instead, we want a CAP that reserves its funds for real farmers, paying them a decent price for their products to enable them to practice long-term farming, sustainable development and safe, healthy livestock feeding. Quite the opposite is what we have today where small and medium size producers are in deep trouble and are being well and truly lynched. They are victims of a pernicious agricultural policy that was pretty much foisted upon them. We do not believe in making things worse in order to further our own ends. We shall therefore vote in favour of this budget as an emergency measure. We cannot, however, leave it at that. The European Union must see its responsibilities through to the end. On this issue, I shall voice my opposition to the idea of renationalising the CAP or, to put it more accurately, renationalising the funding of the CAP, as one amendment is underhandedly seeking to do, which would be tantamount to disintegrating the Community. Incidentally, I would like to ask the majority of this House, which is dedicated to boosting the quality of European integration, if they can imagine what an enormous impact the talks on the future European Federation and on the unification of the great European family would have if, all at once, the oldest common policy were smashed to pieces, if the cardinal principle of solidarity crumbled at the very hands of the Fifteen and if, in the face of a major crisis, there was a return to the principle of every man for himself? I believe that such issues are certainly worth several EUR billion.

 Madam President, first of all, I would like to thank you for having set an example while chairing what is, in a way, the closing sitting of our part-session. I shall now turn to the topic of our debate and say that I welcome the opportunity that we have to give our views on the significance and impact of the decision that the Commission, then the Council, have taken to use for the first time the Treaty of Amsterdam provision in order to address not a sanction, Commissioner, but a public reprimand to a Member State, in this instance, Ireland, as well as to severely rebuke several other countries for not complying with all the requirements of the Stability and Growth Pact. I believe that this will provide many people with food for thought regarding the liberal logic of the current economic and monetary union, just months before the euro intrudes into the everyday lives of 300 million European citizens. Like the others, I do not question the principle of such warnings which are the logical corollary of the coordination of economic policies. On the other hand, I denounce the underlying attitude. The guardians of monetary orthodoxy in the European institutions are obsessed with the idea of excessive public spending, excessive spending on social provision. They have no consideration for the shameful inequality that still exists in the social model that the European Union claims to represent; nor do they have any consideration for the need to promote the human skills necessitated by the information revolution, which is developing at lightning speed before our very eyes and which really has yet to take off. It is significant that health spending, in particular, was specifically targeted in the Commission’s criticisms of various Member States, one of which was France. On almost the same day, the Commission decided to bring a case against France before the Court of Justice since it was guilty of charging the lowest income families a lower rate of VAT on some of the price of electricity and gas. Over-restrictive measures of this kind are not the way to survive the crisis of confidence that citizens are experiencing towards European Union institutions. Reference has been made to the public comments made by Mr Prodi regarding the criticism of Ireland which, up until now, has been presented as a model of success. When the President of the Commission said that sometimes, the schoolmaster must punish even the best pupil, he revealed a stunningly original perception of the new European method of governing. I am counting on the great debate on the future of Europe, which has everyone talking, not to focus on abstract institutional reforms alone but to be based on actual experiences such as those of citizens in the countries which have been targeted by the harsh criticism of the Commission and the Council.

 Mr President, regarding the following resolution, my group felt bound to sign the joint resolution on religious freedoms in China in order to demonstrate that, in our view, there are no borders when it comes to defending freedom of conscience and freedom of expression. On the other hand, most of the Members of my group are totally opposed to any reference to the Falun Gong movement in this resolution. We have therefore requested a separate vote and a roll-call vote on the two paragraphs relating to this issue and we shall vote against these paragraphs.

 Madam President, Commission President, in my view, the Commission’s work programme for 2001 is open to question in several respects, beginning with the role of the European Union in Europe and throughout the world. Negotiations with the candidate countries will proceed following the “road map” proposed by the Commission, in the words of the Commission document, which mentions, I quote, “18 additional chapters” which can be “brought to a close” this year. How, on the basis of such abstract and indeed bureaucratic utterances is it possible to get any grip on the problems to be solved, the contradictions to be overcome and hence the political decisions which must be taken? Moreover, I consider the idea of “policy towards neighbouring countries” to be a great oversimplification. This term is used to describe EU strategy in the Balkans, its relations with Russia and the Euro-Mediterranean Partnership, all of which is covered in just seven lines of text. Some policies undertaken by the European Union in these areas have indeed been criticised, as we saw only last week on the part of the second Euro-Mediterranean Forum. What conclusions do you draw from such assessments? What indeed remains of the EU’s development policy? For the very poorest countries, aside from the trade measure you have just mentioned, you have created the Europe Aid Cooperation Office, on the model of US Aid, and have, for the most part, replaced development with aid. For the other countries, you have traded in the Lomé-style philosophy for a WTO-style logic. What has become of Europe’s ambition for the South of Europe? The second major priority I wish to ask you about is the new economic and social agenda. The Commission must prepare the ground for the decisions to be taken in this context on the basis of a range of criteria dubbed “structural indicators”. In these indicators, what allowance is made for social concerns and all that the United Nations Development Programme most sensibly terms “indicators of human development”? You do not, for example, propose even the slightest social consideration in the Commission’s approval of merger plans between major groups. Why not? What do you plan to do in future to prevent a proliferation of cases like the Michelin, Danone, Alstom, Valeo, Aventis and other scandals, where redundancy plans are announced alongside excellent financial results? Why are you postponing the revision of the directive on a European works council, etc., until next year? That is the context in which you announce a White Paper on governance incorporating a form of partnership with civil society. Returning from the World Social Forum in Porto Alegre, I should wholeheartedly approve this, yet I must refrain, for its almost libertarian-looking political approach is a front for all sorts of economic tendencies that are traditionally liberal in essence. In order, however, to overcome the present crisis of confidence felt by the citizens of Europe with regard to the European Union, we must, I believe, play fair right down the line with the citizens themselves, their elected representatives, their trade unions and their associations, in other words, before taking decisions we should agree to expose the options to the light of day, enable transparent pluralist assessment of the effects of these decisions once implemented and we should dare, if necessary, to change our heading if, perchance, society’s priorities happen to upset the agenda of the Community’s elected officials. What steps, Mr Prodi, would you be willing to take along this road in 2001? (Applause)

 I too, Madam President, would like to take the opportunity during these last sittings to congratulate Mrs Randzio-Plath on her work and to offer her my friendship again, as well as Mr Jonckheer and Mr Goebbels and the others. We have not only deplored the European Union’s situation of profound underemployment and weak growth, but we have sought to build an economic policy at European Union level. In order to overcome the various obstacles, I too would like, moreover, now to put forward some political objectives. The first is that we must first of all seize the opportunity that enlargement offers. The new Member States want growth and they need solidarity. Just like us, and even more so, it is in their interest that the enlarged Europe be a much more dynamic region of the world. The fears of the West must, therefore, be dispelled and common interest built, which means that positive mobility, restructuring and specialisation strategies that enable human and productive capacities in the East and the West to be increased are essential. How, though, are these to be brought about? The second objective is to create new options in the debate on structural reforms. How can investment be encouraged? Two ways are possible. Only the first of these is being used at the moment: the drawing power of capital for high profitability, with fiscal and statutory competition. Failure is inevitable. Another way is to be opened up. Indeed, we must issue the challenge of a new mixed economy, a mixed economy of multinational cooperation, founded on policies of partnership and networks. This is the structural reform that Europe needs and that we will have to devise. The third objective is the renewal of the macroeconomic framework. The Lisbon strategy chose good objectives and a good driving force, but its guidelines are still very ambiguous and it has not found the tools to work with. The greatest ambiguity reigns as regards its interpretation. National policies differ. The redefinition of this policy must be at the heart of the agenda of the next few years, particularly in relation to the Stability and Growth Pact. I think that with a good European budget and fiscal harmonisation, we would indeed be in a better position to resolve the problems relating to the reduction of national public deficits. Finally, my last point is a question of method. The Member States have got an absolute nerve: they do not respect the Lisbon strategy; they do not take it on board. We must build up the responsibility of the national parliaments and envisage reinforced cooperation in the field of economics, but it is particularly amongst the players of civil society, amongst businesses and territorial communities, that we suffer most from a loss of profit. There is a mass of activities to start, but a great backlog of projects and of players. European policy is only possible on the basis of decentralised participation.

 Mr President, it is a pity that the debates on consumer credit and on the single payment area were not combined, because the same issue is at stake in both of them: do we want to construct a European market in retail financial services? Up to now, priority has been given to the wholesale market and to investment services. During this legislative period, the only initiative of any note – though it is an important one – has been the one on the rules for setting rates for cross-border payment transactions within the euro zone. This debate is, therefore, important and I believe that we must now set a clear political objective. That, I believe, is what the Commission wants. The euro cannot be a complete success unless we construct the euro zone as an internal area for payment methods. In order to do that, it is vital that we should achieve interbanking in the infrastructure. The activity of supplying payment services presupposes, admittedly, the removal of national obstacles, but at the same time it also requires prudential supervision. It is on that basis that the internal retail banking market, and in particular the consumer credit market, will be able to develop, and that in turn will allow European banking operators to emerge. Of course, within that integrated area it will be necessary to take into account the diversity of the operators involved, and in particular the special nature of savings banks and mutual societies. What, though, is the best way to proceed? The application of the ‘country of origin’ rule with minimum harmonisation seems to us to be negative, both as regards consumer protection and from the point of view of fair competition. Mr Radwan’s report, which leans in that direction, gives far too much preference to self-regulation. On the other hand, however, maximum harmonisation would leave no room for diversity and would, therefore, also cause a problem. That is why I believe that the best solution is to agree on the common principles of general interest, the common concepts, particularly with regard to universal access to payment methods with a high level of security, services which are inexpensive but in which there is great confidence. The rules governing cross-border transactions must be precise, and intense cooperation is necessary between national regulators. With that in mind, there are several points in Mr Radwan’s report which in my opinion require adjustment. Thus in paragraph 17 the rule recommended by the Commission should be reinstated, that is, the rule restricting customers’ liability to EUR 150 in the event of unauthorised transactions where they have not given notification. As for pan-European direct debit, account-holders must be able to refuse a payment before it is debited from their account. If there is a substantial modification in rates, it must be possible to close or move an account, at no cost, at the request of the customer. It is also necessary to re-establish the liability of the payment service providers over the whole of the payment chain. Finally, it is also necessary to have stronger Community rules to combat the funding of terrorism. The system of complete information must, therefore, also apply to payment transfers outside the Community as well as those within the Community.

 Madam President, thanks to the corrections made by the Council – corrections that Mrs Villiers is unhappy about but accepts – we have arrived at a text for the Investment Services Directive (ISD) that is deemed acceptable by all parties. I will not turn my nose up but all the same I want to say that we are agreeing to a change without being too sure where it will lead us. Removing the order concentration rule from the areas in which it still exists means allowing competition between three systems. Will the conditions for competition be fair? It is clear that companies established in the City, and mainly US companies, have done a lot to promote their own interests. The risk is that they will capture a major share of the European market, to the detriment of other actors, and that they will thus exercise significant control over the financial resources of the various Member States of the Union. The Council and the Commissioner have, however, ensured a degree of balance and have not exempted companies from the transparency obligations. They can still avoid these obligations if transactions involve above-average amounts. I am told that small countries and even some large countries are still controlling the national market share, but I doubt that this division will be viable and we do not know what strategies the various actors, including the stock markets, will adopt. Are the conditions of general interest well established? Can we deter the abuse and insider trading that internationalisation allows to flourish or, in any event, can
 allow to flourish and can we ensure a high-quality price formation process? This appears unlikely. For example, the volume of above-average transactions that will be exempt from pre-trade transparency requirements might account for 50% of the total for the most liquid shares on the Paris stock exchange. Our successors will thus have to supervise the implementation of a directive that is essential and complex but which lacks clear balance. We would advise them to be as vigilant as possible. As regards the directive on the transparency obligations, we have ended up with an overall compromise that is the result of good work. I will, nonetheless, state some reservations. What is most positive is clearly the rejection of the obligation to provide quarterly accounts. Equally positive is the fact that the law of the country of origin will not apply as far as of issuer liability is concerned. On the contrary, our demands concerning complete information about the size of a company’s finances and about the social and economic impact, were rejected by the Council and postponed until a later directive, as were, furthermore, our demands concerning information on the remuneration of company directors. I believe that this is a mistake. The most serious issue, however – and this is neither the fault of the rapporteur nor of the directive – is that the quality of information essentially depends on accounting standards and that the situation in this area is extremely serious. When the European institutions gave full power to the International Account Standards board and gave a commitment to apply these rules as of 2005, I think that they made a very serious mistake. Estimating the basic value of companies, banks and insurance companies mainly according to the market price – deemed to be ‘fair value’ in the prevailing climate – is a source of bias and fundamental insecurity. I therefore suggest that we act very firmly against any illegitimate compromise on Rules 39 and 42 and that the European Financial Reporting Advisory Group (Efrag) and its resources are strengthened as a matter of urgency and, if necessary, the 2005 deadline is put back.

Commissioner, you want to build the internal market on purely commercial principles and with fiscal and regulatory competition, when an efficient internal market in accordance with the European social model requires the creation of public assets and a substantial harmonisation of the rules at European level. In order to impose your views, you tend to use the cutlass method. I would like to take my turn to say that the directive on services represents a real danger, a poison for the European Union. You want liberalisation in all areas, while in January 2004 Parliament again rejected the liberalisation of the education, health, social services and water sectors. You want to remove the exclusive rights for services of general economic interest and impose the rules of public markets, while Parliament has asked for these services to have a legal codecision framework and given its opinion in favour of a right of autoproduction for public organisations. You want to extend the principle of mutual recognition and the application of the law of the supplier’s country of origin across the board. This can only cause ill-feeling and disputes. The only method that can unite Europeans would involve establishing common positive criteria in the different sectors of the internal market by codecision, which would produce harmonisation rules in accordance with our social model. I must also highlight the lack of consultation of civil society in your practice. This is largely responsible for the bad quality of texts and for the large number of disputes. The Lamfalussy method for financial services is much more participative than the one that you use in other areas where you seek to obtain a blank cheque to eliminate regulatory barriers. Nevertheless, the Lamfalussy method is handicapped by many inadequacies that we wish to overcome: the lack of a right of call-back for Parliament, insufficient economic analyses and consultations that are still largely limited to professionals. For all these reasons, I beseech my colleagues – and I have already written to them all to this effect – to re-establish the political line in Parliament in favour of the social market economy. This line was sacrificed at the vote in the Committee on Legal Affairs and the Internal Market. In order to re-establish it, we need to adopt the amendments tabled by Messrs Miller and Ortega.

Mr President, I think that the VAT exemption should be lifted. I do not share the Commissioner’s views on liberalisation, but I am not convinced by Mr Goebbels’ arguments. I think that there is already an internal market for postal services, except for private use. Mail to private individuals, for example, only represents 10% of the turnover of the French postal service. The remainder is mired in competition, and there are inequalities in that competition. Contrary to what Mr Schmidt said, I think that the traditional public operators are particularly penalised by the inappropriate taxation system and by being unable to deduct VAT from their purchases. The reasons are not only purely financial; it is about being able to develop. I would also like to add that there is a tax on salaries to compensate for the so-called privilege of VAT exemption . It would be paradoxical to claim to want to defend public service companies while allowing them to be strangled. I think that the correct solution in these circumstances is to keep the Schmidt and Lulling amendments, which are a further step to the left, with obligatory reduced and super-reduced rates for services that are part of the universal service.

Mr President, the torrent of words, not to say hot air, about the main guidelines can no longer obscure the fact that the Lisbon process has stalled and that the European Union has no economic policy. This, in fact, has been a recurring problem since the birth of economic and monetary union, in spite of all the proposals that have been made. There is, of course, an issue of governance. Mr Blair, Mr Chirac and Mr Schroeder are proposing a super-minister. And why not? But what use is a minister if nobody knows how to solve the underlying problem? What is more interesting is the observation in Mrs Randzio-Plath’s report to the effect that governance suffers from a democratic deficit. She calls for debates in each country, in each national parliament, debates to which the whole of society should be able to contribute, before the springtime meeting of the Council. I may tell you, however, that such a proposal was carried by this Parliament back in 1996, following my report on public participation in the Union’s institutional system, but it was never implemented, and this Parliament has not pursued the matter. In essence, structural reform is something of a magic formula. Reforms are indispensable, but clearly the real issues are their direction and substance and the need to avoid contradictions. If we take the case of the labour market, positive mobility is essential, yet at the same time the Member States are taking decisions designed to prevent workers from the new Member States from exercising freedom of movement within the European labour market. The European Union must therefore create a wider range of incentives, particularly for the much-vaunted development of human capital, an effort that will undoubtedly require a high volume of resources which we are not mobilising at the present time. People speak of industrial policy, but that has not been functioning properly since the time of the Maastricht Treaty. As far as funding goes, it has been established that investments of general interest will not be made without an increase in Community resources. And I must emphasise that the authors of the Lisbon objectives also proposed that public funds devoted to priority projects be exempted from the discipline of the Stability Pact. But that is not all. Everyone knows that there are large sums of money flowing into portfolio investments and restructuring but not into industrial investment. One fundamental problem is therefore that credit facilities, the tax system and savings rules provide insufficient incentive for industrial investment. At a time when the falling dollar is strangling our recovery, it is not actually enough for the Central Bank to effect a general cut in interest rates at the risk of deepening the liquidity trap – what is required is a genuine policy of differentiated credit conditions based on the Lisbon objectives.

Mr President, Commissioner, we are extremely concerned about the Commission’s strategy in relation to services of general interest. First of all, we condemn the lack of transparency, and also of respect, towards civil society and Parliament. In fact, in relation to services of general interest, the Commission has carried out consultations throughout 2003, but they were separate consultations. The Competition DG has produced a package on financial compensations, which I only know about through journalists, and essentially these texts completely ignore the advice and requests of our Parliament. Financial compensation is essential to the very existence of services of general interest. Any intrusion by the Commission in the field of definitions and rules justifying compensations would be unacceptable, since it is outside of its competences. The Commission’s role is to apply the law, not make it. Another reason for Parliament’s call for a legal act under codecision which would include the principles of funding is to clarify the Treaties and case-law. In this regard, only codecision would allow us to achieve a legitimate and viable compromise. Therefore, in the White Paper, which it must publish before April, the Commission must give a clear ‘yes’ or ‘no’ to this demand for a legislative act. By saying ‘no’, by not responding clearly and by assuming the right to impose substantial definitions and rules, it would be committing an abuse of power. For the moment, on the basis of the information available to me, I note that, in the package under preparation, it assumes it has the power to lay down rules, and that many of these choices formally contradict the European Parliament’s resolution. The resolution we adopted on 14 January of this year states that 'the task at Community level for services of general interest is to guarantee their exercise within the internal market and, notably, to ensure that competition rules are compatible with public service obligations'. But I believe that the Monti package, which I have not seen, makes funding possibilities more difficult, in the name of full respect for competition rules. I would insist, under these circumstances, and we have already told you this – I remember in particular the speeches by Mr Langen and Mrs Flautre, last year – on the fact that we do not want a new communication on the interpretation of the Treaty and jurisprudence. We want the Commission to prepare a legislative act involving the codecision procedure. However, the Commission is competent in the field of the application of rules. It is therefore entitled to prepare a decision and a framework, but these executive acts depend, as we all know, on the interpretation of rules. That is why we are asking you to say explicitly today, when you have corrected them following consultation, that these texts under preparation will only enter into force provisionally, while we await the adoption of a legislative act. I would now like to draw your attention to the substance of the Monti proposals, which contradict our resolution. Far from increasing legal certainty, they will worsen the uncertainty. Many services of general economic interest, in particular social, which did not previously notify, would now have to notify. For the acceptance of compensation, the requirements for tendering procedures will be toughened up. Our requests for criteria for the calculation of costs are being ignored. The notion of over-compensation would be greatly extended. As for services provided essentially to companies, they would be considered not to be included in the notion of service of general economic interest, which would represent a blatant intrusion into the field of definitions. So here are my questions. What is the Commission’s timetable for action? Will you respond coherently to the consultation and the proposals on compensations in the White Paper that we asked you to present here in April? Will you state clearly yes or no to a legal act through codecision? Will you state that your executive texts are of a provisional nature while we await the adoption of the corresponding legal act?
Herzog (GUE/NGL
). 
 – (FR)
 Mr President, first of all, in reply to Mr Langen, I would say this. With your usual vehemence you are concealing your own failure, because I would remind you that you renounced your own resolution of 2001, which was in favour of a framework directive, and in January you were forced to accept the fact that we were reiterating our demand for a legislative act by means of the codecision procedure. Do not try, then, to conceal your failure. Mr Patten, you are a diplomat and you know the meaning of words. You talked about confusion. Yet where is that confusion, when the Commission, in its Green Paper, is completely vague on the fundamental issue of funding, and when now, just a few weeks before the end of the debate, it tells us that it is now going to organise consultations on funding? Where is the confusion? Where is transparency? Where is democracy? The only thing that we ask of you is not to organise consultations on financial compensation today, but to produce a text which corresponds to the demands of civil society and of the European Parliament. The present text, which you will be presenting to the Commission in three days’ time, does not correspond to those demands. You also talked about certainty, legal certainty. That is all well and good, but there is a misunderstanding here. In effect, the Monti text will improve legal certainty in the sense that the rules will be clearer, but they have also been tightened up as regards the financial compensation which is the subject of this text. There will be greater certainty, but in the final analysis there will be fewer possibilities for funding public services. That is the content. Do not try to deceive us about the content. You talk about exemptions. All services of general economic interest are social in nature. Those which did not need to provide notification will be obliged to do so. At this very moment the social housing organisations are in the process of indicating to the Commission that the Commission will be obliging them to notify what was not notified previously. So much for making things more certain. Finally, will you please indicate, especially in the White Paper, whether or not you will now agree to prepare a legal act via the codecision procedure. It is, after all, an elementary principle of good democracy to answer yes or no after so many years.
Herzog (GUE/NGL

Mr President, I would like to speak on just one point – State aid for services of general interest. I am addressing you in particular, Commissioner. Through the Resolution of 14 January, Parliament has just confirmed its desire to legislate in this field. In our view, the Commission therefore urgently needs to say, ‘yes, we are going to prepare a legal act under the codecision procedure’. The aim is to increase the scope of public authorities to choose and to act, in particular local and regional authorities, and to ensure that the rules of the internal market and of competition are compatible with the inalienable rights in terms of services of general interest. With this in mind, we wish to establish common principles, criteria for specifying exemptions and derogations on competition rules and funding. We now have codecision power, with Article 95, interpreted in the light of Article 16 of the Charter. The draft constitutional treaty also aims to strengthen that power. I would like to point out that the Commission should implement the rules ex post, but certainly not decide on them itself ex ante. That is the job of the Treaty, the Court of Justice and the legislator. We are concerned about abuse of power by the Commission, in the name of its competence over competition, and we think that it has a degree of legal confusion, particularly as regards funding. First of all, it is not up to you to say whether or not funding is legitimate and in particular what is aid and what is not. It is only after the rule has been made that you should ensure compatibility with competition. There is therefore necessarily an area of possible conflict between the legislator and you. That is why, after the Altmark judgment, we ourselves wish to clarify under what conditions financial compensation under public service obligations is not covered by the rules on State aid. You wish to interpret Altmark yourselves through a communication, and we wish to do it through a legislative act. Secondly, the Commission, having been authorised by the Council, may decide to implement a rule of exemption from notification with regard to State aid. In fact, services of general interest have an increasingly economic dimension. However, our resolution rejects your use of Article 86(3) to decide everything yourselves, claiming an urgency that has been denied for many years. We are therefore asking you to establish a provisional derogation so that the codecision procedure can ultimately clarify the general conditions for validation. Thirdly, taking into account the disputes that there already are against your services and the bodies responsible for services of general interest, we have grounds to ask you to respect our resolution that services such as health, social housing and even social services should be excluded from the scope of application of competition rules and only come under the control of the Commission in the event of abuse of discretionary powers. I would also like to draw your attention to the fact that we wish the future codecision act to establish a right to own production, so that the threat of intrusion from the Commission will not always be brandished under cover of the argument of distortion of competition.

Mr President, on this issue of the liberalisation of the water market, we have a contradiction in the French text. The French version is written in such a way that it seems that Amendment No 48 says that the water market needs to be liberalised without taking into account regional characteristics, while the English version says the opposite. I would like to point out that we worked first of all in English. Those who wish to reject the liberalisation of the water market therefore vote for the original text, if they do not accept Amendment No 103. They first have to vote on Amendment No 103, which rejects the liberalisation of the water market, and if Amendment No 103 is not passed, there remains the original text of Amendment No 48, the first part of which also rejects liberalisation.

Mr President, although in my view there are still many negative points regarding the substance of the text, I consider that we are enabling the discussion process on this important subject to continue with a legislative act, with the rejection of the Commission procedure without codecision, and with very clear signals regarding the rejection of liberalisation in some sectors and we are introducing a sound evaluation process, so I am voting in favour.

Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, our vote on this report is eagerly awaited. Throughout this working year, I have experienced at first hand the vehemence and the passion of the political debate on this subject. Before Maastricht, local and national authorities made their choices, and those choices coexisted comfortably with the Common Market. Since the advent of the single market, conflicts and concerns have been rife. The fact is that a solution to these problems is still being quite literally prevented by the existence of taboos. Some boast of a proud record of liberalisation. In the opposite corner are those who regard public service and competition as incompatible. Others – and I hope there will be many of us – believe that liberalisation has had both positive and negative effects, that a better balance needs to be struck between commercial and non-commercial principles in the substance of laws and regulations and that such a balance would enhance cohesion and efficiency. An objective assessment of the real situation is needed, because the conviction that the market does everything better is becoming an article of dogma and is dividing Europe into two camps. It seems crucial to me that the legislature should be committed to redressing the balance and reconciling these conflicting principles in accordance with the great tradition of European civilisation. Many of my honourable colleagues accept the idea of a balance but consider that the power to strike such a balance rests exclusively with the local, regional and national public authorities. I absolutely agree that the decision-making rights of decentralised administrative bodies should be defended and strengthened, but I am convinced that the market will steadily erode them unless the Union acts as a guarantor of these rights and takes its due share of responsibility. And indeed our Community would not really serve any purpose unless it also provided complementary services in domains such as education, rail transport or information. My colleagues have rejected this line of argument, but I stand by my view that subsidiarity and co-responsibility must go hand in hand. Throughout history, Europeans – be they Christians or Humanists, Liberals or Socialists – have deemed it essential to ensure that services of general economic interest were so organised as to foster the development of the individual and enhance life in society. Let us not fall short of those ideals. Let us strive resolutely to bridge the gaps that divide our national communities with regard to the ethics of universal access to services of general interest. As to the matter in hand, why a framework directive? Not for the sake of legislating, because we do more than enough of that. In this case it is necessary, however. It is time that the legislature itself interpreted the treaties instead of letting the Commission exercise all sorts of power – legislative, executive and judicial powers as well as powers of self-assessment. The Convention recognises our right to do so, having inserted a new article to that effect in the draft Constitutional Treaty, and the prevailing situation demands that we do so. Firstly, a legal framework must give services of general interest the status of a positive right in law rather than simply condoning the protection of such services as a derogation from the norm; rules governing the market and competition would then be bound to respect the status of these services. Secondly, there is a need to eliminate the profound uncertainty about the distinction between services of economic interest and those of non-economic interest. Key areas such as education, health and water must not be liberalised, and there is a need to recognise the increasingly numerous hybrid situations in which social, economic and environmental factors are intertwined. Accordingly, my proposals are designed to provide local authorities, non-profit businesses, semi-public companies and public-private partnerships with a general framework of more solid guarantees within which they can develop. Thirdly, there is a need to clarify the principles relating to funding and organisation. The Altmark judgment on state aid is a step forward, but it leaves serious question marks about the calculation of costs, while care must also be taken to avoid criminalising public operators. Fourthly, we want a pluralist and independent evaluation method to be established. To reject it would be an affront to democracy. Let me add that a framework directive would certainly be consistent with the sectoral directives. We therefore ask the Commission to respond quickly to the results of the consultation process it has launched and to the parliamentary vote by answering this question: what commitments is it prepared to make with regard to the legal framework, funding and evaluation? Moreover, we refuse to accept the use of Article 86(3), which gives us no right of codecision, in its response to the Altmark judgment. I should like to offer my very sincere thanks to the numerous associations, NGOs, trade unions, local-authority networks and businesses which were consulted and whose opinions enlightened and assisted me. Like the elected politicians, they want to have the legitimate means to express themselves far more on the policies and rules of the Union. Let me also thank my fellow members of the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs, who have shown great commitment, and particularly those who have been seeking compromises. Regrettably, a majority said no to a framework directive and no to a democratic evaluation. By so doing, they not only rejected my proposals and our compromises; they quite simply turned their backs on the resolution adopted by this Parliament in 2001. Tomorrow, the House can reaffirm its endorsement of that resolution. Ladies and gentlemen, I firmly believe that many of you, whether on the Right or the Left, are pledged to defend and promote services of general interest. For this reason, I strongly urge you not to retreat into party or national blocs but to make up your own mind on each amendment, on each article, motivated only by the general interest of the European people.

 Mr President, I will begin by presenting the apologies of Mrs Randzio-Plath, who is unable to be present. The Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs will be voting on this question of extension this evening under the simplified procedure, Article 158 (1), so the outcome should be known quickly. I think we will in fact have an agreement, but the vote takes place this evening.

 Mr President, we very much welcome the political debate that is beginning on the Stability Pact. Mr Prodi gave the word and it was re-launched by the Ecofin Council. The Commission is very wrong to put adherence to the rules side by side with political judgment. The law is flexible when the realities so require and it is then the duty of politicians to interpret it. This Pact, which is currently being tested by the realities, signed in 1997, at which time, the Commission, the Central Bank and many states heralded an era of sustainable growth. Having first denied that there was a recession, they then declared that it would be brief and that the economy would soon recover. Those who were so wrong should not dole out lessons. Today, the improvement in the situation is fragile. It must not be compromised, particularly as we are at risk from the fall in the dollar and serious American imbalances. Some governments make a show of virtue in contrast to the large states that are deemed to be guilty. However, the behaviour of these critics often appears to be opportunistic. In fact, on many occasions their inflation rates are above the average – which reduces their debts – they play at fiscal dumping in order to attract capital and they forget about the Structural Funds, of which some of them are major beneficiaries. There are therefore several good reasons for flexibility in the Pact. It does not take account of the cycle, it maintains divisions, it seeks to impose penalties without offering encouragement, and it is incapable of responding to the nagging problem of the very poor potential for growth in Europe. As a result, it would not be an exaggeration if the Commission were still to be portrayed as the guardian of procedures. We need a political actor in Brussels. There is no such thing as a European economic policy and we want to create one. This is a matter of urgency. The Pact is not dead, as proved by the commitments made by France and Germany for 2005. However, if the economic recovery were not confirmed or were poor, it would be extremely difficult to fulfil these commitments. I say again: the reform is essential. To this end, the method is as important as the substance. All of the quarrels among institutions and among states highlight a blatant lack of democratic capacity and legitimacy. The assessment by peers of the discipline and quality of the national budgetary policy is undoubtedly necessary, but it is not enough, as was mentioned previously. Solidarity and greater participation are required to build an economic policy. In this respect, I believe that the interactive dialogue between the national parliaments and the European Parliament, as well as the consultation of civil societies, are vital elements. As far as content is concerned, we need both rules and acts. We do not reject the principle of a pact for rules that seek to combine stability and growth. However, we have strict ideas as regards the substance. We need rules that encourage timely action and improve the quality of expenditure and revenue. How can we claim to legitimise a budget discipline when the Union shamelessly cultivates fiscal competitiveness? France and Germany are right to call for the tax harmonisation that a number of other states refuse to allow them. These rules must guarantee too the capacity to finance projects considered to be in the general interest. We also need acts. There will be no successful reform of the Pact if we do not build, as a complement, a European budgetary policy, with a genuine budget to help finance the objectives of sustainable development and cohesion agreed at the Lisbon and Gothenburg summits. Is it not unfair to prevent at least the countries in the euro zone from having a joint capacity for budgetary action when they share a single monetary policy, but are deprived of a second major economic policy lever? Unfortunately, there is the risk that the IGC may not open these doors and that the reform of the Pact may be too limited. You can therefore expect an increase in tensions, to which our debates today are only a prelude. (Applause)

Madam President, I will focus on just one point: is a European regulation for telecommunications needed? Nick Clegg is saying that it only has to be provisional and I am saying that it must be permanent and firmer than the current regulation. I would have liked Nick Clegg to give greater consideration to the analyses of distinguished economists from Oxford and Cambridge, who stress that if competition policy is ex post, 
then the regulation has to be ex ante
 to meet the economic, social and environmental aims. The rapporteur stresses that incumbent operators must give way to competition and, although this is true, it will not automatically be efficient, nor will it even be effective where competition is limited. The European telecoms sector has just come through a disastrous period in terms of investment and employment and has frittered away its lead with the GSM provision. A UMTS regulation would have allowed the use of infrastructure to be shared, instead of investors duplicating them and getting heavily into debt by doing so. Furthermore, the discrepancy between the ‘price’ criterion and the ‘quality’ criterion forced the UK regulator to impose greater quality obligations on British Telecom. As regards the social and territorial cohesion objective, the Commission report is particularly weak. Is there really universal access? We do not know. Does it need to be extended with effective territorial coverage for mobile phones with access for everyone to a fast Internet connection? There again, there is no opinion. Generalising the call for tenders procedure could favour all the pressures for eliminating universal service. As regards the issue of calculating the costs for special financing, the answers vary significantly depending on the choice of the relevant territory. All this becomes all the more important in the context of enlargement. Who will dare to say the liberalisation will be enough to ensure that private capital is invested en masse
. I will therefore speak strongly in favour of more stringent European regulation. There is no evidence to support the idea that the national regulatory authorities should simply be independent and regulate themselves. These authorities must be part of a legislative and regulatory framework in the public interest.

 Mr President, I would like to begin by thanking Commissioner Liikanen and the rapporteurs for their contributions. It takes some courage to say there is a very serious risk of de-industrialisation. The desire to build a powerful industry was at the heart of the ECSC and then of the European Economic Community. But we have not had an industrial policy for more than ten years now. How can we fail to question a profoundly biased position, which sets the creation of the single market against the role of the State, horizontal action against sectoral action? Each of our Member States is managing its restructuring as it is able. There is no desire to promote the European productive system as a whole. The definition of an industrial policy is therefore becoming a matter of public interest. We must make it a social choice. It will be impossible for European growth to recover without boosting industry. It would, moreover, be foolish to count on services alone, because it is innovation and productivity, in industry and around it, that create the added value necessary for services to grow. If national policies continue to diverge, Europe will be incapable of being a base camp for our enterprises in globalisation and the challenge of competitiveness will be lost. So I am for entrepreneurship, without a doubt, but I think enterprise can only develop if we create the collective conditions for growth in Europe. That is the advantage of the action plan that has been suggested to us, that is why we need sectoral European projects, a revision of the guidelines for competition policy and Community aids, a commercial policy that is more favourable to our development, and the ability to create partnerships around territorial communities. So far as small businesses in particular are concerned, creating them is not enough. Europe’s problem is that they are not growing. Finally, it is good to measure the effects before legislating, but we must not over-regulate either. The important thing now is to try to build European leaders that will be the foundations for sustainable development. I will end with a word about method. This recovery will not be possible without involvement and I therefore call for a strategic dialogue between both sides of industry, public authorities and the Community institutions. (Applause)

 Mr President, Commissioners, our first task is to make a correct diagnosis of events. The Union might have made mistakes, but I am not going to make it the scapegoat for the entire breakdown of negotiations, in the same way that I would not blame the donkey in la Fontaine’s fable for eating two clumps of grass. One can and indeed one must discuss tactics but our negotiators did, in essence, stick to their mandate; they made many concessions and backed down in the negotiations on investment and competition. The Union was under no obligation to go further. On the other hand, and I shall return to this point, the reality of the situation means that we must undertake a thorough review of our mandate. At Cancún, there were other parties willing to stand in judgment and also others who made mistakes. The United States hid behind our skirts, because they had no desire to become involved. India and many other countries showed no interest in the Doha Agenda and although Brazil was interested, in particular with regard to agriculture, it attached greater importance to its own political development. A wrong diagnosis can be extremely dangerous for the future when major issues are at stake. Let us beware of pressure from within to abandon the common agricultural policy. A good reform requires moving towards eliminating export subsidies, and certainly not long-term support. We must be vigilant in ensuring that industrial problems are not ignored, because it is the international division of labour that is at stake in the WTO, involving an enormous number of jobs. We must beware of a certain naïve optimism as regards the North-South divide. Like many other speakers, I note the pairing off of the advocates of free trade and the major exporters of agricultural produce from the South. I also believe that it would be suicidal for employment in Europe not to see that China, to be followed in future by others, is emerging with huge comparative advantages. My second question is: what should we do? The discussion that has been proposed is welcome but for the moment should we not also be thinking about initiatives to help the vast number of poor countries who genuinely need results now? Should we not, therefore, include on the Doha Agenda reopening negotiations as soon as possible on some key issues, such as export subsidies, cotton, textiles, special and differentiated treatment and probably transparency too. In the medium and long term, we must hold fast to multilateralism and undertake more detailed work on reforming the WTO, calling on the citizens to become involved and to participate. I believe, and this is where the developing world activists are right, that if the WTO is to be consolidated, a new look must be cast at its foundations, in any event, those that involve a sense of responsibility. The WTO is built for free trade and the trading of comparative advantages, but issues of legitimate protection are increasingly being raised. We in the North do so by talking about patents, public health, the environment and the social clause and in the South they raise the issue by talking about access to non-reciprocal markets. This is why, in my opinion, our ‘liberalisation plus rules’ line will never fully convince the European public, because it knows that these are rules favouring free trade. We therefore want to see a world fair trade organisation, with rules for a fruitful mutual opening up of markets that will also entail achieving a balance between liberalisation and genuine protection. In this context, some differentiation is necessary, given the enormous disparities between countries throughout the world. This is a political issue that has failed to find a satisfactory solution at the WTO. On all of these issues, let us enter into open dialogue with Brazil, with the G21, with the G90 and also with the US public. Could we not also redefine our bilateral and regional policies, which rely too heavily on the mantra ‘Aid for Trade’, whereas most countries say that they have other priorities, such as pre-sale production capacity and also being able to make use of international public assets.

 Mr President, the new directive on investment services seeks to order competition between three major structures: exchanges, the Internet and companies using internalisation. Competition between them over processing transactions will intensify as the European financial market becomes more integrated. Everyone knows that the City of London, which is also an aircraft carrier for American investment banks, has a strong lead where internalisation is concerned. Other companies such as Deutsche Bank
 or ABN-AMRO are launching out into the trade with ambitious business plans. I observe that in carrying out our task as legislators we have singularly lacked a sound economic analysis clarifying the nature of the competition entered into and its implications. For example, do we want the small European markets stretching from the South to the East to be piloted by a handful of global players in London? In this House we are accountable to the general interest and not the interests of individual countries. That is why we have supported two main principles: quality of information and fair competition. Businesses that use internalisation harness huge resources, but they do not form the market. They manipulate it but they need it, which is why pre-trade transparency is crucial to the quality of price formation, in particular to prevent volatility, speculation and insider dealing. The Commission proposal applied this principle of pre-trade transparency that Mrs Villiers initially wished to abolish. Later she accepted it. She has shown great professionalism, it has to be acknowledged. She has given ground, but a large number of traps and mines were adopted in the committee on her initiative that drain this requirement for transparency of much of its meaning and create legal uncertainty. This applies to the definition of businesses practising internalisation, bonds and the size of orders, the exemption for eligible counterparties and the notion of price improvement. As it stands, the report that was adopted proposes a system of regulation that is inferior to that enjoyed by the United States. That is why we have requested a number of separate votes so as to remove passages that we feel are harmful. Our aim is not to conclude this at first reading at any price nor simply to seek a compromise between the various interests, but to adopt a resolution that really does serve the common good.

 Madam President, we can all measure the positive economic impact of the birth of the euro, and I am thinking in particular of the general easing of interest rates and the abolition of risk premiums, from which all European countries are benefiting. However, we can also see the limits to these benefits: the short-lived expansion phase from 1997 to 2000 and the current economic stagnation. It was Jacques Delors who said that the euro was not enough. He asked for strong coordination of economic policies. We have not yet achieved this, and we are now desperately in need of a European economic policy. I approve of Mr Gasòliba’s report, which is a move in this direction, and which expresses the desire for, among other things, the development of public and private investment, of human capital, of research, and of the mobility and qualifications of workers. The Convention should have drawn up the tools to achieve these objectives. It has not done so and that is one of its great failings. We have not really been able to construct the euro group within the framework of the work of the Convention. Even though Member States could, as they say, take additional measures in terms of major economicpolicies, they have neither the fiscal nor the budgetary means to do so. I would add that the monetary policy which was mentioned just now, and about which complimentary words were spoken, neither anticipated nor understood the reversal in the world economy and was very late in reacting to it, which demonstrates the difficulty that we have in imagining our position within the world as a whole. It is all very well to talk of structural reforms – and these are certainly essential – but, as Mr Delors also said, competition is not enough: we must build up cooperation and solidarity between us if we want to have a successful economy and play a role in the governance of the world economy. Without this willingness and these concepts, let us at least work towards institutional reforms, let us try to equip ourselves with institutional tools. You have proposed a single representation of the euro zone, and have aired the idea of a minister for economic affairs who would play a role that was at once both internal and external and who would operate as part of the Commission. Obviously I can only support these proposals, which are a step in the right direction.

 We are all convinced that fighting for multilateralism is a good thing. With multilateralism under threat, we must do all we can to make Cancun a success. But it is a bit like squaring the circle. On the one hand the Americans are defending their interests by every means, while cultivating the myth of total free trade and, on the other, many countries of the South are unable to take their place in the world economy, questioning the present trade rules and demanding positive discrimination. How can the EU play its part as a bridge-builder and point the US in the right direction? While noting the positive efforts that have been made, I do wonder about a number of points in the policy on Cancun because we, too, are not without contradictions between our interests and our intentions. Firstly, how can we make a better defence of special and differential treatment? The developing countries are not the only ones at fault; we are not clear on this point either. The scope for such treatment is excessively broad, depriving the concept of differentiation of any real relevance. And the question of the rules is very much a grey area. Can we look at them again for TRIPS and for regional areas, not forgetting the question of technology transfer? Secondly, I support those who do not want to drop the aim of preparing questions about ‘Singapore’ – I differ from Mrs McNally slightly here – because it involves key aspects of the link between trade and development. But does the EU have to stick to its initial line? I agree with the bottom up approach, but would it not be better to support the restrictions, especially pre-establishment, involved in the claim for a political area? Moreover, there is an urgent need for the Cancun talks to be underpinned by powerful parallel initiatives for the redistribution of direct investments, guaranteeing their sustainability. Thirdly, so far as agriculture is concerned, we are defending a strong position regarding internal support and the calculation of tariff reductions. But will the most vulnerable countries of the South, which only produce one thing and are net importers, benefit in any way from it? Should we not increase market access and abolish export subsidies on products that are strategic for those countries and adopt a framework initiative in favour of fair trade?

 Mr President, I am an advocate of an integrated market in the network industries which will serve as the basis for a competitive European economy and for social inclusion, particularly by means of interconnection, but on two essential conditions: that the joint networks are treated as public goods and that we are capable of managing a common energy policy. I endorse and welcome Mrs de Palacio’s work to this end. However, I can see that neither our states nor our institutions are taking on board the concept of public goods as yet, nor are they adopting the idea of a common policy. Moreover, the Treaties do not give them competence to do so and the outcome of the Convention with regard to this matter is extremely uncertain. The sectoral directives are undeniably seeking to move towards 
public service obligations, focusing on universal service, the environment, interconnection and security of supply, but they are only recommendations to the states. As we are quite aware, we have no legislative authority to enforce a European right. Without a doubt, we are entering the realms of a regulation too, and by a regulation I mean a public measure allowing us not just to introduce genuine competition but also to bring it into line with public service obligations. Basically, competition needs to be developed further. Some Members want to force this. It is easy to criticise dinosaurs, my dear Mr Turmes, and overlook the contribution made by historic operators and what they did for consumers. It is easy to call for ever-increasing ‘deintegration’, but absolutely nobody has any idea as yet how to regulate a ‘deintegrated’, multinational competition system properly. It is ten times more difficult than regulating a national integrated monopoly system. We have not taken into account the Californian experience, price volatility or the inadequacy of long-term contracts. We are not capable of securing development investment. In particular, I noted the obligation, which I believe is premature, of separation in respect of distribution, with regard to which the Members are trying to outdo the Commission, for they want to go as far as separating ownership. We are not the only ones to want to create a retail market for household electricity supply. There is fierce debate in the United States and Canada. Do the gains offset the costs? What are the gains? Maybe the price of a pizza for an average household once a year. And the disadvantages? All the transaction costs and lack of security.

 Mr President, Mr García-Margallo y Marfil calls a spade a spade. He stated that the European Union does not have an economic policy. He has contributed to a good debate and I thank him for this. In considering causes and solutions, the notion of inflexibility and structural reform are often bandied about. We are forever asking the Commission, the ECB and the experts what they mean. I have been struck by the imprecise and inconsistent nature of the responses. At a remarkable conference, Mr Adair Turner, the Director-General of the CBI, said that we must be careful about dismantling the Welfare State and that the agenda for liberalisation in Europe, although useful, represents only a partial response to present challenges. Clearly, the problem of pensions will not be resolved unless there is a large increase in employment rates in Europe. It is essential to mobilise all human potential. A great deal of work will have to go into reforming the labour markets, especially as regards training and qualifications. We must, however, remember that this involves reorganisation and there will be a price to pay. We must consider why there is a lack of productive public and private investment. One of the reasons relates to the flow of capital, much of which ends up in the United States. Though the financial market might have stimulated global investment over the last decade, I think it is a fallacy to believe that the market itself will initiate a new round of investments in Europe. It does not provide for local development or for the development of SMEs and infrastructure. The European Union should be able to finance effective networks of services of general interest and develop policies on productive enterprises. We do not only have a supply problem; we also underestimate the problem of demand. Hundreds of billions in paying off goodwill are putting a serious strain on business and are hampering recovery. Far from fearing inflation, the European Central Bank should amend its target and reduce its real rates below zero. Furthermore, even if some Member States have not known how to reform their public finances or been unable to do so in time, the seriousness of the present climate justifies taking measures to support activity, including waiving the 3% rule as a temporary measure. There are two more points I would like to make. I believe war against Iraq is not just madness, but economic folly too. It will increase public deficits pointlessly in both the United States and Europe, when we want to reduce them. As one of our experts said, the United States is skating on very thin ice. The future growth of that country will require us to make even greater demands on our capital reserves. This is yet another contradiction. Europe cannot therefore just tag along with the United States. Europe must devise a policy of her own. We in Europe have our backs against the wall. The Convention, however, is silent. As for the calls for economic government, they bring to mind a scene from the film Shoulder Arms
. In it a military unit is engulfed in fog, everyone is stumbling around and a soldier is heard calling for his captain.

 Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I believe a directive on supplementary retirement provision businesses should have been established to provide a degree of social protection. The European Union does not have such a mandate however. Consequently, this report forms part of the work towards the objective of creating an internal market for financial services. This is absolutely clear. Above all, this report will allow supplementary retirement provision institutions in Britain and elsewhere to benefit from their position and offer cross-border services. We voted against this report at the first reading at the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs. The document certainly sought to correct the shortcomings concerning social obligations but it made investment risks worse. The common position of the Council better safeguards the prudential requirements for investment, but it does not meet Parliament’s demands on social issues. We have called for this common position to be rejected. We think that this report must be reconsidered in the context of the serious crisis affecting the stock markets at present. This is affecting pension funds. It poses a risk to the level of benefits and is causing contributions to be increased. Confidence in these pension fund systems will not be restored without strict management rules and mutual insurance structures for the guarantees. It is also necessary for these structures to be covered by European collective conventions between social partners. I would like to say that Mr Karas has worked very hard on this report and has ensured that the text is balanced. At the end of the day, however, we believe the amendments have a limited scope. This is down to the agreements between the different components of the political groups and what the Council deems to be acceptable to avoid conciliation. The report is an improvement on the common position, and the amendment proposed by the Group of the Greens/European Free Alliance strengthens the prudential requirements for investment. Nevertheless, the fundamental and essential slant of the text remains.

 Mr President, very briefly, it is essential that an evaluation of the impact of liberalisation is carried out at WTO and European Union level, not just at Member State level. A moratorium is not a good idea. Bilateral liberalisation is very successful and, most importantly, developing countries frequently request it. Progress has been made in transparency but there is no WTO forum and the European Parliament has only a very limited power of consultation. The battle to defend public services is falling far short of expectations. The threats of disintegration lie within the European Union, where competition policy is inappropriately applied and the specific rules much too weak. Examining Mr Lamy’s offers, we see that they are strictly confined to the internal choices of the Member States and the Union. We must not forget the priority of development, and we must not speak in place of the South. That said, I would like to see whether our demands for liberalisation take into account the need of the countries of the southern hemisphere for services of general interest, and I would point out that there is no framework for the activity of multinational firms. Lastly, there is a dreadful imbalance between the rapid rate of liberalisation and the lack of public goods at regional and world level. When will there be an action strategy for the European Union?

I think that today we can welcome the vision of those who established the EBRD, Jacques Attali (even though subsequently his management was called into question) and François Mitterrand. We can also welcome the political agreement of the French and German governments, which was crucial to completing the project. Now we have a great regional development bank and today we congratulate Mr Lemierre and the Bank’s staff. I am entirely in agreement with my colleague and friend Mr Markov, and will just raise some questions for the future. First of all, should the original political objective not be renewed? For the CIS countries, this objective is still to promote transition to a market economy. However, in the case of the countries involved in enlargement, the transition is well underway and in some cases completed, and for them the objective is now catching up, development and cohesion, so that they can be fully integrated. Secondly, the Bank does not operate as an ordinary commercial bank. It gives priority to SMEs, helps local banks, takes on responsibilities in terms of nuclear safety, takes risks, in short, it serves the public interest. Should these specific qualities not be consolidated at a time when the Union is working on a funding system focused on the internal market? Are there not risks of contradiction there? It is true that the Bank has a triple A rating, but that is linked to budgetary support, which we must guarantee. Are there not also problems in terms of achieving a balance between profit-making and loss-making projects? Finally, how can we consolidate the way that it complements public aid and the EIB? Thirdly, does the EBRD not have a particular role to play in order to promote social responsibility among companies and market operators? Its principle of additional funding is very good and provides it with a lever with which to encourage public/private partnerships. Fourthly, the EBRD can make a genuine contribution to establishing good governance of the public institutions of the countries concerned, in particular by seeking to involve civil society and the needs of the populations. Could it not begin to evaluate that experience by country and group of countries and put its ideas for the future to us?

 Mr President, I would like to congratulate Mr Andria on his excellent work, first of all, and secondly on his political courage in this difficult matter. From the start, in the action plan for the financial market, this matter of clearing and settlement did not receive the attention it deserved and we therefore now need to remedy this omission. Post-market infrastructures do indeed play a fundamental part in the proper conclusion of transactions. You spoke of trust and security. Systemic risks are also inherent in this type of activity which therefore clearly fall within the scope of general interest. On the other hand, these activities have an increasing return. It is for these two reasons that, based on experience, a public interest regulation is vital. We know, however, that these regulations exist at national level, as well as at European level, and fragmented infrastructures and rules predominated until recently. That is why it is time to establish a legislative act in accordance with our objective of building the internal market. We can see, however, that in the absence of appropriate legislation, the current development is biased and dangerous, as bodies are being formed which carry out both clearing and settlement activities and competing banking activities, with no general interest framework and apparently at risk of distorting competition. The rapporteur is therefore quite right, for reasons of both content and experience, to choose a public service line, or, I should say, public utility line,
 the terms are not important – in the United States they talk about public utility, it amounts to the same thing. Hence the proposals to separate non-profit-making activities from fee systems based on costs. In conclusion, I shall say that now is the time to legislate. I do not understand why we should consult again. We have clear positions from the rapporteur which Parliament should adopt without sugaring the pill in order to achieve a positive line. We believe that the Commission should now, for the sake of the credibility of all our work, prepare the draft directive.

 Madam President, no coordination, no procedure can be effective if there is a lack of political will. This must be our starting point. Some good objectives were set out in Lisbon and Gothenburg, but there is a huge gap between what is said and what is done. The European Union is facing serious economic problems, its growth potential is slowing down, public and private investment is very weak and it is lacking skills. Neither the Stability and Growth Pact nor the monetary policy is dealing with these challenges. They are assigning everything to the Member States, and coordination cycles, which are designed to be the Member States’ area of discipline, cannot work if the Union also fails to adopt and implement common policies. There is no genuine European economic policy due to differences between the Member States. Coordination cycles do not examine economic relationships between countries. And we do not yet have a global approach to the European economy and the eurozone, considered in the context of globalisation. We do not yet have a policy on demand, networks or human capacities. The Union is still an area of regulatory and fiscal competition, where the very notion of social market economy is not accepted and will not be incorporated, in my view, in the future constitution, especially since there is still genuine aversion towards economic affairs. I shall now turn to institutional procedures. What the Commission is proposing to us is purely technocratic. I am in favour of merging different areas and setting up a cycle. I agree with the principle of streamlining. However, this will not remove the aforementioned political obstacles, hence my suggestions. First of all, the Treaties provide no solid basis for communitarisation of the economic policy. Our priority must therefore be to establish this basis in the Convention. Secondly, no reliable comparative statistical and analytical tool exists, particularly for social cohesion and sustainable development. As a priority, we must therefore provide the Union with investigative and analytical resources which are equal to its statements. Thirdly, the proposed procedures do not yet have any democratic value. We urgently need a broad public deliberation on the situations and options prior to the Commission’s package, as well as a subsequent evaluation, by civil society and the elected representatives, and not only by the Commission. Fourthly, I do not believe that the European Parliament is today still capable of properly debating and of choosing a coherent economic policy. Too many positions held are marked by national interests alone and ideological mindsets. Having said that, Parliament is better placed than the Council and the Commission to deliberate and assess the economic policy. An annual interactive discussion is therefore necessary between national communities and the Community institutions at Parliament’s initiative. Only then will the Commission draft its proposals, only then will the decision be referred back to the Council, but Parliament could then have a power of ratification. To sum up, without shared political will and a common democratic procedure, the coordination of national policies will fail.

Mr President, I would like to thank all my colleagues who have supported me and in particular those who share the view of this report, which I believe to be balanced and concerned with real situations. I note that the amendments tabled by Mr Evans and Mrs Riis-Jørgensen ruin that balance and in fact condemn any state aid in market activities. I therefore hope that these amendments will not be retained and that the balance achieved in the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs will be preserved in plenary. I worked together with the Directorate General for Competition, which very carefully manages state aid policy, and I am very pleased with how the dialogue progressed. Like any competition policy, the policy on state aid is facing new challenges. Its prime objective remains to reduce all aid that distorts or could distort competition, but other objectives should also be taken into consideration: competitiveness and growth – the Lisbon objectives – and social cohesion, which involves support for struggling regions to catch up and develop. This is why the Stockholm and Lisbon European Councils made the commitment not to reduce all aid, but aid in the sense of Article 87, in other words aid that creates unfair competition. They particularly advocate redeploying aid towards the horizontal objectives. All of these Council decisions must be implemented firmly, but with discernment. I stress in my report that the effectiveness of horizontal aid must be evaluated. For example, the legitimacy of aid for research, the environment, training and employment is clear, and increases in this aid are often desired. However, it is not always effective in terms of the Lisbon and Gothenburg objectives, and we should therefore move forward with our recommendations. It would be dangerous to ban any notion of sectoral aid, however. This aid could prove to be essential for strategic projects on which Europe is falling behind and the market is declining, but also for dealing with unfair competition on the global market, or to save production operations that are faced with very serious economic shocks. We are aware that the Commission has also itself opened the debate on the interaction of competition and industrial policy. The enlargement of the Union to the Central and Eastern European countries also poses difficult problems which must be dealt with fairly. If the private sector will not fund the modernisation of the steel industry in Poland and the Czech Republic, in a global context of excess capacity, should we nevertheless ask those countries to give up developing that sector? A re-examination of steel aid is essential. In the same way, while it is legitimate to aim to eliminate special tax arrangements and convert them into regional aid, it should not be forgotten that countries such as Ireland benefited a great deal from them until recently and that as the economic level of the Eastern regions concerned is particularly low, it will not be possible to create viable companies straight away. Regarding services of general interest, a perspective of progress is emerging. The Council and the Commission are re-assessing their interest for the Community. In accordance with the wishes of Parliament, the Court of Justice recognises that financial compensation, in return for the obligations imposed, is not aid. We therefore want the Commission to speed up its discussions on this basis and to propose new tools soon in order to ensure free choice, resources for services of general interest, and competition, as well as to safeguard non profit-making activities. Finally, we ask it to speed up the work on considering tax systems, described by the Primarolo group as encouraging unfair competition, in terms of state aid that should be eliminated. Ladies and gentlemen, the scoreboard is a step forward in achieving transparency and in the public debate, and we welcome this. However, the Commission is aware of the limits that we have highlighted. The comparability of data between Member States is not guaranteed, the effectiveness of aid has not been evaluated and a comparison between the Union and its major world competitors has not yet been provided. These are also areas to work on in the future, and in view of which, it would be desirable to increase the involvement of civil society. Allow me to add a few words on competition policy as a whole. Competition is essential for the viability and efficiency of the internal market. However, the European Union has a great deal of progress to make in terms of industrial and technological development. We should not move backwards in terms of competition policy, but we need to bring industrial and competition policies to the same level in the treaties and in practice, otherwise the Union will fall behind in terms of innovation, scale effects, networks and creation of companies. Experts already believe that its potential for growth in terms of production and productivity has slowed down, while we wish to speed it up. The process of mergers is only one aspect of the problem. We are aware that the general centralisation of powers within the DG poses a problem, but we do not want to swing towards the American model. In the reform under preparation, we would prefer a much more open, deliberative instruction procedure, which allows for reasonable timescales, while the decision would still be the responsibility of the Commission.

 Mr President, following the fall and the serious functional problems of the world financial markets, it is essential to establish stronger European regulations and joint prudential supervision. We could well ask ourselves whether the Lamfalussy procedure is the most appropriate method and whether it should be extended. The procedure rests on the distinction between framework legislation and secondary legislation. In principle, this is justified, but is does pose a fundamental problem for the exercise of democracy. As co-legislator, Parliament must be placed on a strictly equal footing with the Council. Accordingly, it must have a call–back power. Along with my colleagues, I therefore call for Article 202 of the Treaties to be reformed. I appreciate the Commission’s commitment on this issue. I have noted what Mr Pedersen has said, and I await confirmation from the Council. The quality of consultation is another problem that concerns democratic control. A meaningful debate has yet to be held on the legislative programme. There is now a better consultation of professionals, but much remains to be done to improve consultation with other sections of civil society, and satisfactory schedules have still to be established. On the whole, I welcome the principle of the Lamfalussy procedure, but I hope the process will be improved before it is in any way extended. Indeed, I call on those involved to ensure this is done. I believe I am right in thinking that the Council has already ratified the selection of Ecofin Council. Consultation played no part in this decision which appears to me to be a denial of democracy. On the substance of the matter, I have actually had the opportunity to hear Alexandre Lamfalussy spell out the concerns. These revolve around a significant difference between banks and insurers with regard to the market and the prudential imperative, which is of the utmost importance. We are, however, aware that the national regulatory structures are not just different but entirely out of line with each other. This being the case, I was very surprised to hear Mr Pedersen advocating that we should now establish a single FSA type solution, even before the matter has been discussed. A much wiser approach is offered by Mrs van den Burg’s report. It aims to introduce genuine coordination. It also proposes defining the role of the European Central Bank, which has an essential role as a lender of last resort. I would like to discuss one of the problems relating to the rules. It relates to our readiness to align our rules with those of the United States, and to work towards an integrated transatlantic market. This is a crucial political issue that we have not yet debated. I agree with bringing our rules into line with each other, but we must work on the basis that we are devising our own models. Members of the European banking sector have already publicly and courageously raised the question of accounting standards. These professionals do not want to see their establishments and depositors threatened by insecurity, which would ensue if reference were made to market values in drawing up balance sheets. I have to say that the Council acted irresponsibly when it conferred full powers on the IAS board. When the fundamental rules and standards protecting the general interest of the people of Europe are at issue, the issue of democratic control should figure more prominently.

 Mr President, I would say that our Parliament has worked extremely well and that we should congratulate our rapporteur, Robert Goebbels, on his excellent work. We should, in particular, welcome the fact that the pressure to incorporate the concept of intent into the definition of offences, a concept which is usually impossible to prove, has been rejected, and also the fact that we have strengthened obligations of transparency in the field of insider information and in cooperation between market surveillance authorities. We are therefore in the process of breaking in the Lamfalussy procedure which has got off to a good start, I believe, with fine cooperation between our three institutions. Nevertheless, I feel that it is perhaps regrettable that the Commission asked, at 6 p.m., to begin its work on the regulation’s implementation before it is even adopted by Parliament and the Council. In any event, this was merely an excuse to redouble the pressure exerted by the lobbies of financial journalists who want, in fact, to create a general exception in their favour in the field of comitology; I am talking about self-regulation full stop. In our view, financial journalists must indeed comply with all the provisions concerning transparency and the veracity of information and, with regard to the progress that can be made in the field of comitology, this will fall under a future revision of Article 202. This is why we fully reject the two amendments tabled by the Liberal and PPE-DE groups and support Amendment No 5, adopted by the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs, which further strengthens the guarantees concerning that profession. To conclude, I wish to say that, in light of the extremely serious shortcomings revealed by current developments, we are simply trying to take the first step, particularly where insider dealing is concerned. What is at stake is the entire production and consumption of the financial setup. Consequently, with regard to the harmonisation of accounting procedures, government reform of businesses, the organisation and the supervision of audits, of financial analysis and credit rating, we call on the European Union and the Commission in particular to rapidly draw up new regulatory and legislative initiatives.

 Mr President, Mr Prodi, we owe you a big thank you. It took courage to say that the Stability and Growth Pact is stupid, and you have shown even more courage today in persevering and clearly defending your point of view. We now need to go further, and revise this Pact and set a new objective. The Pact is stupid when your house is on fire, and you are right, we must stop burying our heads in the sand. The financial crisis is even more serious in Europe than it is in the United States. We must be prepared for at least two difficult years of restructuring, with the inevitable social consequences that this will entail. And we will not be able to overcome this crisis without strong public initiatives, which will require use of the budget. The Pact is also stupid when the Union is moving away from the Lisbon objectives, as you mentioned. It is stupid when enlargement would require a Pact for the countries joining the Union to bring their economies into line with those of the current Member States, with practical solidarity. A Stability and Growth Pact worthy of the name would protect public spending of general interest, put a stop to fiscal competition that scorns ethics and effectiveness, provide the Union with a real budget, and guarantee the Member States’ capacity for action, while maintaining a discipline of control over public debt. Mr Prodi, you are demanding that the Commission be given real authority over the coordination of economic policies, but we want more than early warnings and the authority to take corrective action. What we want most of all is for the Union to adopt an economic policy that addresses the current economic situation and sustainable development, and although the Commission is in effect the only executive body designed to promote common interests, it does not yet have the necessary culture and legitimacy to implement an economic policy That is why we are protesting so that the future constitution of the Union clearly establishes a new legitimacy and political will. The Union would no longer be merely a marketplace but would participate in societal choices and concepts relating to the public economy. Its mandate would come from the people and the powers of civil society, and parliaments would be set up to draft and monitor decisions. (Applause from the left)

 Mr President, the 1990s saw an almost universal opening up of world trade, while, worldwide, with the exception of China, the number of people living in absolute poverty increased. The number of countries classed as ‘least developed’ has increased, while the scale of poverty has continued to be huge in a number of countries with a high growth rate. The relationships between trade, development and poverty are complex, then, and we must avoid hasty judgments. My report to the Committee on Industry, External Trade, Research and Energy, which was adopted unanimously, contains proposals on this subject, some of which have been included in the Deva report. I will just focus on two main issues here. Firstly, aid, particularly technical assistance, is a key issue. There is very little information available on this subject but there appear to be a wealth of horror stories. What is essential is that the countries concerned can define their needs and communicate them to international agencies, setting themselves objectives and pursuing them. That is where our support is needed, and we must ensure that civil society and companies in the field participate as widely as possible. We must break with the practice of setting biased conditions which, in actual fact, serve the interests of the dominant countries. Aid must serve principally to create local diversified supply capacity. Any trade administration must be established at the level of regional common markets. The report also requires the WTO to negotiate social measures to give vulnerable peoples new prospects in the face of the impact of liberalisation. Moreover, it calls for the issue of migrant workers to be included in the negotiations on services. Lastly, it calls for aid to offset losses from customs receipts in the least-developed countries. Secondly, the report considers that the place of anti-poverty objectives at the very heart of unilateral trade rules still needs to be defined. I fear that the Commission may be frankly sceptical about Special and Differentiated Treatment. Not so us: we call for it to be redefined. As regards future negotiations on investment, they may prove to be fruitful, but we would warn that direct investments very seldom reach the poorest countries and, when they do, it is in return for tax favours which harm these countries first of all. Without cooperation between the WTO and the other major bodies, without combating financial fragility, it is unlikely that the negotiations on investment will produce fruitful results for all those who are afflicted by poverty in the world.

Mr President, Commissioner, given the increasing volume of business mergers and their profound social and economic impact, there is room for improvement on the proposals contained in the Green Paper. As the rapporteur, Mr Berenguer Fuster, points out, the control of mergers is one of the mainstays of Community competition policy. Competition, however, cannot be used as the sole criterion when assessing the acceptability of a planned merger. Other objectives defined in the Lisbon strategy, such as the dynamics of full employment and competitive industries, must also be included in the assessment. Both types of objective should be accorded equal legal status with a view to preventing any lessening of competition but also with a view to advancing the interests of industry and employment, which have become the poor relations in our present-day economic policies. The question of renewing the assessment criteria is therefore crucial. Greater consideration must be given to the realities of global competition, it should be recognised that the idea of national markets is becoming meaningless in all but a few segments of the economy, that the European market is what counts now and, finally, that there is a need to develop the concept of contestable markets by moving towards the criterion of significant lessening of competition. At the same time, procedures must be improved. The One-Stop Shop principle for operations of Community interest is excellent, provided it is combined with good safeguards. The notification conditions can be simplified and the two-thirds rule preserved without losing sight of the need for coherence within the Community. However, it is on two methodological aspects that substantial progress must be made. In view of the huge social impact of these operations, it is imperative that representatives of the workforce and the other interested parties be consulted before any final decisions are made, as proposed by Mr Goebbels and Mr Berenguer Fuster in their amendments. The procedure used to test the market must be made completely transparent; to this end, it will be necessary to listen to the arguments of the interested parties and to respond to their observations. The interests of industry have thus been protected, which was the purpose of one of my amendments. More could be done, of course, with regard to the contestability of decisions. Effective competition in the wider market on the one hand and development of industry and employment on the other: these are two aims on which further improvement is needed.

 Mr President, this draft regulation is very important. It has not, however, been subject to co-decision. One of the Convention’s priorities must be to subject all the important regulations to the co-decision procedure and we are counting on Mrs Berger to do this. The draft text aims to reduce the substantial price differences in the Union, but these would be much less substantial if we harmonised taxation. Regarding the other points, must we really reduce competition and step up the intensity of distribution? There are limits to consumerism. Vertical agreements enable us to guarantee consumer safety and contribute to enhancing the industry’s robustness. We must make these agreements more flexible in order to increase the independence of the local dealer whilst maintaining the chain of responsibility. The chief danger of the draft text is the withdrawal of the location clause. This would pave the way for large, specialised companies and large retailers. We have also witnessed the sacking of the CEO of Virgin; you forgot to mention him, Mrs Riis-Jørgensen. If these distributors entered the market, it would spell disaster for small- and medium-sized businesses and it could lead to considerable job losses, and a loss of proximity to the consumer, except in the most profitable territorial areas. We are particularly concerned that the consumer will be exposed to the risk of a break in the sales and after-sales service link if the distributor is able to award after-sales service contracts to authorised repairers which are not subject to a location clause. Our committee calls for an assessment to be carried out in 2005 before any final decision is made regarding the freedom of establishment of distributors. This will provide an opportunity to examine the practices of reducing price differences that are compatible with maintaining the location clause. This is a reasonable compromise. Of course, other reforms could be envisaged at a later stage. The dialogue with the Commissioner was extremely positive overall: although we are not in agreement, we had an extremely useful discussion. And the work by our committee was also very thorough and I feel that it produced some worthwhile amendments. Parliament would be well advised to take on board most of these conclusions.

 Mr President, Mr Lamassoure’s report is very interesting. I share his ambition to give more powers to the Union so that it can cope with its responsibilities and with what is expected of it. In particular I approve his efforts regarding foreign policy, defence and security. However, I do have some objections. We need to rewrite the objectives which form the basis for the Constitution of the Union, and that is what will convince our citizens that progress in competences is fully justified. What are those objectives? The market, currency, freedom of movement – these are not enough. We must go further. At world level Europe is committed to effective multilateralism. It bases its security on dialogue, the abolition of poverty, and development links. It chooses full employment and progress in human capacities. It is against exclusion and bases its cohesion on the sharing of common goods, and finally it has given itself a public space which enables multinational and transnational Community citizenship and democracy to be exercised. These choices are what gives Europe its identity. In the form of a constitution, they should be the subject of an annual and multiannual policy agenda. The balancing of rules and the division of competences are intended to achieve these objectives. In this respect, the report lacks any ambition as regards the essential renewal of the social model and of growth, an important subject for our citizens and a subject on which we are divided. The rules of competition must be balanced by common rules and tasks concerning security, public services and industrial policy. The Union must have its own competence in matters involving economic policy, and it must have a redefined framework for the coordination of national policies, as well as fiscal harmonisation of the budgetary and revenue tools. As for the exercising of these competences, the democratic challenge and the requirement for efficacy, on these points the report is too brief and a few amendments would improve it. As for the nature of the actions of the Union, I cannot accept the assumption of the rapporteur, who believes that the Union can manage things only in exceptional cases. A political Union which did not manage at all would actually be very irresponsible. Finally, the separation and division of competences should not be based only on the principle of subsidiarity. When coupled with the rule of competition, it does not legitimise a community. It should be accompanied by a second principle, the principle of solidarity. Let us try to spell it out. Players in civil society must be consulted directly, and must be able to manage resources jointly in order to carry out projects which are of Community interest. Let us therefore be brave enough to form a society in Europe.

Mr President, may I express my thanks to Bruno Trentin for the quality of his work and for being a good listener. In his diagnosis he clearly emphasises that Europe is not cyclically dependent on the United States and that the research and technological-innovation gap between the two sides of the Atlantic is liable to widen, with the Union clearly lagging particularly far behind in terms of public and private investment. But how should we respond? Our Committee wished to adhere to the principle of coordinating national policies, which it sees as one of the mandatory precepts of the Stability Pact. But who can fail to observe the extremely poor results of this coordination? Who can fail to see that the Pact, while providing Member States with a useful discipline as far as public deficits are concerned, does not begin to define the policies that are required if the development targets set in Lisbon are to be met? As for the intensification of fiscal competition, it compels governments to cut public spending, even on essentials. And who can also fail to observe that the Member States will not let the Union acquire budgetary and fiscal instruments that would enable it to support a policy of investment and development? This is why, unlike Mr Radwan and contrary to the letter of the report, I believe we cannot continue to operate within the bounds set by the present treaties. It will be necessary to go beyond the coordination stage and try to extend the powers of the Union. The broad economic policy guidelines and the Stability Pact must be reviewed if we want to adopt a truly cooperative approach, and we must press for the Union to obtain the budgetary and fiscal instruments without which it cannot pursue real economic policies. Accordingly, our Parliament should seize the present opportunity to take a historic initiative by formulating proposals for submission to the Convention on the Future of Europe. It would be a cruel disappointment and, I believe, a political error of the first magnitude if the Convention did not try to strengthen the European Union and its powers in the sphere of economic policy at this precise time when some large question marks hang over the development and cohesion of our Community.

Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, all the Member States have decided to create a large market for electricity and gas. It is a good choice, but the problem lies in a single question: ‘How are we going to create this market?’ The aim of the Commission’s new directive is regulated competition. The main assessment criterion we should use is whether or not there is a balance between competition and regulation, that is, whether or not the fundamental rights to a public service, environmental quality and security of supply are taken into consideration. The goals of many of my fellow Members in the Committee on Industry, External Trade, Research and Energy remain within the proposals made by the Commission. Their sole objective is to speed up liberalisation and create a level playing field. Others have tried to pave the way for a regulation of general interest. Claude Turmes and Bernhard Rapkay have carried out significant work to this end. At the end of the day, however, there is an imbalance between the choice of effective competition and the requirements of society. This imbalance is unacceptable. That is the raison d'être
 of our strategic Amendment No 177 which aims to oblige the Member States to fulfil both their obligations regarding competition and increased, more effective obligations of general interest. We do not agree with the attitude of the French State which opposes the opening up of its domestic market while the French public operator is buying market shares elsewhere. However, the compromise it is asking for today, which consists of establishing freedom for non-domestic customers to choose their supplier, while being able to retain a reserved sector for domestic customers, is a good one, in particular if this means equal tariffs throughout national territory. Those in favour of the market have not presented any economic argument to justify the obligation to open the market to small customers at all costs, even though this could result in additional inconvenience and cost rather than freedom. Common sense would dictate that a principle of diversity be respected. With regard to the obligation on competition, strong pressure is being exerted in countries like France or Germany, where the traditional operators are powerful and well-established. The requirement for transparency is justified, as is the requirement to set up an independent regulatory body. However, ownership unbundling, or the separation of transport and distribution, amongst others, threatens to destroy effective groups. Making room for new players in the renewable energies market is justified. Attacking the nuclear industry and the national assets of our neighbours is not. I also find it shocking that certain advocates of competition are opposed to Community legislation in the field of market access. The TPA negotiated actually represents the closure of the German market. Others are demanding reciprocal market access, even though this contradicts the very notion of the large market and stirs up ill-feeling. On the contrary, we believe that the European Union, that is to say the Commission, the Council, Parliament, organised European civil society, must take on tasks of general interest and regulation duties. Otherwise simple competition would be dogged by increasing national conflict.

Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, good work was done in Doha. I believe we have three good reasons to appreciate the results. The first is the real involvement of the southern countries and the evidence that multilateralism is effectively beginning to happen. Before Doha we did not have a pre-negotiated agenda; after Doha we have to deal with a whole range of claims put forward by the southern countries. As a result, the WTO, still fragile but better recognised, is therefore strengthened. Of course this is not yet the kind of democratisation the NGOs and European parliamentarians had hoped to see, but there has clearly been progress and Mrs Neyts-Uyttebroeck is right to emphasise the transparency and improved method seen in Doha. Unlike Caroline Lucas, I was not aware of general anger or frustration; on the contrary, I noted a sense of relief all round because this method enabled us to finally reach some degree of consensus. Let me add, and I was surprised that this was not mentioned in the opening statements, that we are committed to negotiating the reform of the instrument for settling disputes. Secondly, a window has been opened for examining the coherence between social questions and trade rules. Liberalisation is indeed continuing, in particular in order to respond to the southern countries’ interests with regard to market access. Thanks to the European Union, however, and here I believe we can thank Pascal Lamy for his firm stance, we have the beginnings of a broad agenda – the environment, investment and competition can be negotiated on the basis of an explicit consensus. In substance, this is still not much and we can understand why some of the NGOs wanted a more ambitious agenda, one that included the social aspect in particular. If we are to achieve that, however, they and we will have to overcome some major inconsistencies. Indeed we must not conceal the inconsistencies between different interests and claim to always speak in the name of the south. Differences must be expressed if they are effectively to be overcome and that is how we managed to make progress on the question of medicines, when the north-south conjunction proved effective. Similarly, we can make progress on the social aspect only if we carefully reflect on how to help strengthen international trade unionism. Thirdly, for the first time, as much importance was attached to implementation as to the new subjects introduced. Here again, I did not interpret the results in the same way as Caroline Lucas. We made progress on the method and thanks to India we had a system not of prior evaluation but of ongoing evaluation during the negotiations: textiles, agriculture, anti-dumping measures, subsidies and even intellectual property were negotiated – with the possibility of renegotiation. To conclude, we still have to make great efforts for the future to ensure that the process runs smoothly and in the right directions and here I have two points to make. The first is that there is a strong risk that the Union’s trade policy will be handicapped by the absence of a common policy. We have a certain lack of cohesion here and it is up to us to clarify our agricultural and industrial social model. My second point is that the social question is emblematic. There is no question of giving up and adhering to the ILO. The European Union must demand the establishment of multilateral social dimensions for development and solidarity. So we still have a lot of work to do on this subject, but this should not frighten us.

 Mr President, after 11 September, we have every reason to redouble our commitment to multilateralism. Persisting with the Doha meeting and making it a success are, therefore, of considerable political importance. Of course, we cannot at this stage hope for the sea change that is required, but adapting, improving and consolidating the WTO system would at least be a good start. As supporters of the multilateral approach, we must fulfil this commitment. The criminals who destroyed the twin towers of the World Trade Center know the value of symbols. Making trade the focus of coexistence with other countries is a deeply reductive approach and directing world trade centrally is unacceptable. Multilateralism must be neither asymmetrical nor imperialist. Doha will not be Seattle, however. Civil movements have helped to make their leaders think, the southern countries are, with the welcome support of the Commission, playing an increasingly important role and the time when Carla Hills wanted to use a crowbar to open up other countries’ markets to her own will will soon be a thing of the past. Doha is not a sign of a new wave of liberalisations, but nor is it an agenda for development. It will be something vague between the two. An agenda will be negotiated there whose objectives will remain general. There has been no prior negotiation of the outcome, fortunately, and we approve of the principle of the Union’s mandate: to set a broad agenda, but more than just balancing liberalisation by means of rules, there is no getting away from the fact that we must try to resolve the contradictions between society’s choices and trade rules. The social issue is symbolic. The main front on which we need to fight is finance, and a Union which allows tax havens to flourish within its borders must put its own house in order. Nobody can claim, though, that trade has nothing to do with fundamental rights. The WTO may not be the place to produce social conventions, but it certainly does have a responsibility to ensure coherence. The implementation of the Marrakech agreements and the incorporated agenda on agriculture and services will be at the centre of the forthcoming round. The legitimacy of the trade interests of the South must be recognised but the problem will lie in preventing negotiations boiling down to a process of tough haggling over their interests and our own. The concerns of northern societies as of those of the South must lead to a change in trade rules and to break their monopoly that favours one group. With this in mind, we must accept that we will have to open the door to the renegotiation of certain rules, in particular, those concerning intellectual property. Lastly, although the democratisation of the WTO will certainly not be on the agenda, it is nevertheless clear that this round will not succeed if it is nothing more than a diplomatic battle between countries, even if the European Union is happy to play the honest mediator. Civil society must be involved; we must consult our citizens and take account of their criticism and their demands. This is the only way to ensure that democracy will penetrate the WTO.

Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, the dogmatism and apathy dominating the economic policy of the European Union are causing great concern. Unemployment is rising once again, there is a threat of recession and the conditions for lasting growth are not in place. However, so far, the Council, the Commission and the European Central Bank have come up with platitudes and have convinced themselves that everything is fine. The euro does provide protection against currency speculation but it offers no protection whatsoever from financial crises. We are involved in financial globalisation up to our necks. The main cause of the current apathy is the fundamentalist approach of those opposed to state intervention. Those who subscribe to this view try desperately to promote fiscal competition, as Pierre Jonckheer reminded us. They reduce public spending but welcome turgidity on the stock exchange and its requirements to produce financial returns. This results in a lack of public and private investment. Another reason for this apathy is that social-democratic visions for Europe are somewhat lacking. I think it is time we recognise this. You advocate strengthening coordination between national policies. I am in favour of this, but we must recognise that basically this has come to be equated with the Growth and Stability Pact. I am sure you will confirm this. The debate must not remain polarised between the ‘fundamentalists’ and those who want to make the Growth and Stability Pact more flexible. We advocate an action plan to get us out of this rut. Firstly, as elected representatives at a European and national level, we must come to a consensus and call for a revival of the European economies. We must send a message along these lines to a meeting of the European Council in Ghent and to the Commission. In order to achieve economic revival, we must favour public spending and credit as opposed to tax cuts. Funds to promote investment should also be established. Secondly, we believe that we must carry out an in-depth revision of the Growth and Stability Pact. This Pact has remained unchanged since 1992, although the global situation is now very different and the euro has appeared. I appreciate the idea of starting to make it more flexible, as mentioned by Mrs Neyts. However, we want something more than this. We want reform. Two principles should guide us in this. Public or mixed economy choices should balance market forces. Must I point out that President Bush used Keynesian policies to revive the American economy, after President Clinton refused to cut taxes to increase his popularity? Furthermore, the criteria of state intervention should allow for decision-making at national level and for solidarity. Restricting public deficit to a maximum of 3% in no way succeeded in preventing the exacerbation of differences. Consequently, the new Growth and Stability Pact would be based on common criteria for effectiveness, relating both to taxation and public spending. Taxation should combat the volatility of the financial markets and government stocks by taxing financial products and revenues. Spending should create the necessary conditions for lasting growth, employment, security and solidarity. We also want the Pact to include taxation and budgetary tools appropriate to the European Union. Fortunately, the Belgian Presidency has suggested this. Thirdly, the Laeken declaration must include a commitment to establishing Community powers in relation to macro-economic policy.

 Mr President, like those fellow Members who have spoken before me, I approve the principle of competition policy reform proposed by the Commission. I welcome decentralisation. The present centralised method, which means that there is a backlog of cases, is inevitably somewhat arbitrary. It cannot guarantee legal certainty. However, I believe that reform will inevitably lead to an extremely interesting raising of the stakes as regards the clarification and development of the rules. And it is on that point that I differ somewhat. Article 3 is clearly vital. It establishes the principle that Community law overrides national law in cases where practices are likely to affect trade between Member States. But this principle is not acceptable without some clarification. For example, in the case of services of general interest or other services that are essential for the Member States and the regions, I am convinced that there is a need for derogating provisions. At the very least, the Commission should, as proposed by the Economic and Social Committee, present an interpretative communication on this subject. Article 10 is another important article. It rightly provides that the Commission can make observations to the Member States for reasons of Community public interest. Some clarification is essential here too. Jonathan Evans highlights the example of major investments. Services of general interest also need to be mentioned in this particular respect. Two final remarks. The rapporteur is right to stress that it is contradictory to replace prior notification by a register. I think that we should do away with the register. He is right to call for convergence in national law. That is the heart of the problem. It supposes that other countries’ cultures are respected and that a certain balance is achieved between competition, social and environmental standards, including standards for general interest services. So take a look at the Langen report and other reports.

 Mr President, the directive drawn up by the Commission contains an obvious bias. It is concerned with using market valuation to encourage supplementary pensions. Although the report by Mr Karas corrects this bias in places, it also makes it worse in others. We are faced with a reference model which is primarily that of the industry of supplementary pensions in place in Great Britain and other countries. Yet, in some countries, these organisations do not or only occasionally enter the financial market; in other countries workers are given cast iron guarantees, but the directive obviously does not aim to do this. In particular, it is not concerned with the coherence of national pension systems based on the principles of solidarity, security and universality. That is why we tabled amendments on two aspects. The first, on the one hand, relates to guarantees for the people concerned, and the second, on the other hand, to public supervision and prudential actions. We believe that this text is unacceptable unless it is subject to considerable amendment. First of all, we must improve the guarantees given to the people. The directive includes risks of discrimination and lapses in solidarity. Membership of a supplementary scheme is not compulsory, which explains the considerable inequalities. There is no provision for inter-sectoral mutualisations. The quality of benefits will suffer if the population falls. Continuity of membership cannot be guaranteed if mobile workers change jobs or sector. The definition of rights does not mandatorily include biometric risks. The guarantees of actual benefits are not organised. And we are aware of the risks taken by those who join fixed contribution schemes, pointed out, moreover, by many well-respected macro economists. We are proposing amendments on all these points, as well as on the second issue giving us cause for concern which is the need to improve social and prudential supervision. The Commission is offering insurers the choice of opting for occupational pension schemes. The Karas report strengthens this provision by casting aside government authorisation. This opens the door to competition and gives rise to two risks: the first is that solidarity work may be abused and that prudential systems that have been imposed on insurers will be weakened. Mr Karas incorporated our amendment seeking to establish the principle of interactive management, but that will only have any real bearing if the institutions involved are not treated like standard financial investors throughout the directive. The prudential framework laid down by the Commission is vague and the report imposes the country of origin principle, which we find unacceptable, since the destination Member State must, of course, also retain the possibility of establishing coherence with internal social law. Lastly, prior tax harmonisation is still not included in these texts, which means we are once again opening the way to fiscal dumping. Ladies and gentlemen, we are today faced with a key test on the way that the European Parliament perceives its responsibilities in the area of social protection.

 Mr President, I did support Mr Katiforis’s efforts to give a bit of an impetus to our resolution on economic policy. In the end, however, the report that we voted does not provide any real options and that is why my Group does not support it. The Union’s economic policy stands out for its passivity and its dogmatism. The Council, the Commission and the Central Bank are quite content and will not move an inch and the European Parliament has not managed to take up the challenge. Our economic policy is demonstrating passivity in the face of a situation that is growing worse and in the face of the criteria that we would have to meet to ensure the sustainable development of the European Union. The Central Bank tells us that, in the short-term, it should not intervene, since it is concerned with the medium-term. With regard to the medium-term, however, it refers us to the structural reforms. To put it plainly, monetary policy and budgetary policy must serve neither regulation of the present economic situation nor sustainable development. This is clearly absurd. What, however, do we say about it? We do not manage to come up with anything significantly different, despite Mr Katiforis’s efforts for public and private investment, highlighting the current situation of under-investment. In his explanatory statement and as he has repeated this morning, Mr Katiforis insists on the fact that public investment must take precedence over the concern to reduce public debt. The position we have finally adopted, however, is dogmatic with regard to public finances and to the stability pact. Mrs Randzio-Plath has spoken this morning, and not for the first time, on the quality of public finances and taxation. I think that this is the way forward. The reality of the situation, however, if you look at all of our resolutions and texts, is that they are all concerned with reducing taxation and with reducing public and social spending. We are not succeeding in implementing this line of reform, which is intended to bring about a qualitative improvement. Take, for example, our resolutions on reducing social security contributions coupled with wage moderation. Our social and public spending contributes to keeping workers poor. We are subsidising low-paid jobs and when it comes to expenditure, we know that massive public investment is needed and that public money is essential to make this investment, but we do not want to suffer the consequences. It is the structural reforms that are given the most prominence, reforms that were conceived solely as a form of deregulation, as a sort of panacea, whereas in reality, the new problem, which is the new economy, is an organisation of the market designed to achieve sustainable development and social cohesion. This requires a large contribution from public funds. We talk about lifelong training, but we have no policy in place in this field and where aid for energy policy is concerned, we have made no progress at all. The same thing applies to transport policy and as for an industrial policy, we simply have none. All of this would require a real increase in investment. Ladies and gentlemen, if we wish to give economic policy its rightful place in Europe, I hope that, in addition to the first strategies that I mentioned just now, but which have not achieved success, we can prove that we are up to the task of making it a reality.

Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I believe that we must send a clear warning to the Council and the Commission that the conditions for democratic control over a fundamental issue have not been met. Moreover, the mandate given to the Wise Men referred to the method, whilst the political debate on the aims and the substance of regulation and political control is still far from over. To create a European financial market could be a move in the wrong direction because of the finances of unstable and discriminatory markets or an obsession with financial assets. However, the exercise may turn out to be positive if it is a question of pooling resources to develop a productive system, social cohesion or inter-generation solidarity. However, who can say that we are actually preparing that? It is not the European Parliament that is slowing things down. The Member States have said yes to a pan-European financial market, but they have not bothered to consider its impact. They have not developed a strategy and have come up against a great deal of administrative opposition. The Committee of Wise Men had to propose an extremely complicated procedure which was typically intergovernmental, whilst a method giving powers of initiative to the European Parliament with the establishment of a European regulator who was equipped with a clear mandate would have certainly succeeded in an effective, acceptable and rapid fashion. So we have a method which is totally inappropriate. This is what we are saying today in unanimity with the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs. We want at least a power of recall, which would enable us to control this extremely bureaucratic procedure, which is slipping from our grasp. We demand that this challenge be brought within reach of public opinion. Once again, it is a question of democratic choice. (Applause)

 Mr President, we are not having a very lively debate. Why? The impression we are giving is that the European Union is very passive. There are the movements of the global market, there is the policy of the United States, and we are looking on. With regard to these events we are far from having an economic policy. We do not have a doctrine of public economy in Europe and we are therefore a bit closeted here, I would say, in the Ministry of Words. Allow me to make three observations. Firstly, the analysis of economic conditions presented by the Central Bank and by the Commission could, in fact, be summed up more or less by a slowdown in the global space, even though, for us, the growth indicators are good for the next few months, that is for the coming 18 months, and do not encourage us to budge. We are lamentably lacking initiatives to consolidate the potential and perhaps real growth of the European Union. For my part, I would lay great stress on the need for public and private investments and on the accumulated delays in the matter of research and training. Instead of that, the report unfortunately takes up the anti-inflationist obsession we also find in the discourse of the Central Bank, and the failure of the Galileo project would be disastrous. Secondly, we have said that the social policy was necessary to consolidate growth. In the words of Emilio Gabaglio, the impression is that we are witnessing a sort of derailment between Lisbon and Stockholm. We should give concrete expression to our desire to develop knowledge and skills in the European Union in the form of a spectacular initiative. Thirdly, we talk about an acceleration of balanced liberalisation. The debate between competition and service of general interest has only just started. I am convinced that the internal market will not come to fruition unless we impose obligations to provide services of general interest at the Community level. Here too, we lack initiatives. I hope that the next few months will prove me wrong.

 Mr President, I find the report by our fellow Member, Mr Schwaiger to be generally positive. Indeed, it follows on from the great efforts made by the Directorate of the Commission to redefine our trade policy and to ensure that trade serves the objectives of sustainable development. Having said that, I have four comments to make. The first is that, while undertaking a new round of talks on the basis of a wider agenda is still more than ever a fine objective, the mandates granted by the Council cannot be said to be satisfactory as they stand. In this instance it is not a matter of bartering trade concessions in return for environmental or social clauses, but rather of taking a different tack in negotiating on trade in order to ensure that it is in better accord with the societal models and state regulation requirements. In this respect, the talks scheduled in the Built-In Agenda are a test, which brings me to my second point. The agriculture line is not without its grey areas. There is, admittedly, an increased awareness that trade in agricultural products must be compatible with independence in terms of food supply, public health and land use, yet we are at a disadvantage due to the postponement of reform in the common agricultural policy until after 2006. Indeed, the report speaks of the need to safeguard the model, though it is more a case of the need to change the model. Regarding trade, while it is essential to reduce export subsidies, we reject the calls to bring them into line with world prices, as this is a blatantly productivist move. Thirdly, the line on services is not satisfactory. There is talk of ‘further progressive liberalisation’. That is a unilateral objective. The Commission, moreover, states that trade policy is not a goal in itself, but it must help support the social model. Yet, in our social model there are services of general interest, and in developing countries such general interest services have yet to be formed. I shall, therefore, endorse the development of trade compatible with, or contributing to, the promotion of services of general interest. The European Union wishes to keep some sectors, such as, education and culture outside the domain of free trade. That is not enough. We have to work in the context of universal public assets. Indeed, it would be marvellous if the Directorate could provide us with a communication on the ways in which free trade and services of general interest may be complementary and compatible. There is one last point I should like to raise on a major problem of governance. We must work with civil society as we do with the developing countries and allow a frank exchange of views. This is something the Directorate does, but not the States, and Parliament is lagging behind. It is the responsibility of every single one of us. This is an approach that is critical in ensuring the success of the organisation of world trade.

 Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, the first phase of the internal market is drawing to a close, marking the end of monopolies and the opening up of national markets to competition. Today we are debating the options for the second phase. The question has been raised, and it is more than a question, it is a choice. Mr van Velzen was one of many who said that our aim is a great pan-European market. I concur. Today, however, we are discussing the options of ‘how’ to achieve this, and there is a difference between choosing to achieve genuine and sustainable competition, as in a traditional sector – which is what Mr Brunetta advocates – and what we would like, which is different; i.e. public regulation of networks in Europe, with competing services but alongside the development of a universal service, and, where necessary, possible sharing of infrastructure. What is at stake, therefore, is the debate on how the market will be regulated rather than the objective of creating a pan-European market. We believe that the option being considered is of dubious value; i.e. to have national regulation of the telecommunications market and common rules on genuine competition on a Community level. It is unsound, because, currently, national regulation means every man for himself. All the Members of this House have criticised the problems of allocating radio frequencies, the extreme variations in licence costs, the excessive debts of some of the operators, and so there may be risks of the telephone market crashing just as the property market crashed a while back. Therefore, we are not favouring indiscriminate national regulation but we are in favour of the rules of competition, even if, for example, the Commission has tried to move towards the concept of a relevant market, which is not supported by the Council and we have to deal with – and the Commission, perhaps, is not moving in this direction – issues on development of a universal service, problems with investment savings and on sharing of the networks so as to be able to reduce costs. We would therefore advocate – and I personally would advocate – a system of European regulators, basically to create a pan-European market, but we come up against the European framework of references and rules, and I believe that we are going to have to look more closely into this, because the solution that we currently have is an absolute hybrid, I must stress this. The proposed package, which will result from all these negotiations, cannot be seen as set in stone. Despite the efforts some have made, it is another regulatory nightmare. That is why I believe that we need to widen the public debate on the action plan that you are outlining, by involving civil societies to a much greater extent in order to reach agreement.

 Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, what is the path to be followed after Lisbon? I would like to give my response in terms of the content, our responsibilities and the method. First of all, I believe that we cannot regard the European Union’s strategy on sustainable development, full employment and greater social cohesion as set in stone. The Lisbon process has many virtues and its objectives are extremely ambitious and well founded. It has a comprehensive and open method of coordination and reflects a clear understanding of the challenges of the information revolution. However, it still contains many areas of bias. The current framework to monetary, budgetary and financial policies encourages fiscal and social competition; the ability to carry out public policies is still compromised on a national level and is totally obstructed on a European level. I would say that this is negative integration, in the sense that Tinbergen intended, and it is not wholly positive integration. These areas of bias are obvious in the current problem regarding indicators. There are comparable indicators at a national level, which are useful, but there are no European-level indicators to enable us to rank Europe’s position in the global economy and to apply common policies. Moreover, we do not study the impact that the choices made by one or more countries have on other countries. Why is Ireland being criticised? Is it for its policy of public spending in favour of growth or actually for its anti-Community social dumping policy? I understand why Mr Bullmann says that growth is actually taking place but that we must not rest on our laurels. In this respect, it is disturbing that the Council and Commission do not evaluate the social and economic impact of the large, integrated financial market or that of the launch of the euro. That is why we should consider Lisbon to be more of a beginning than an achievement; we must work on ironing out these contradictions and, sooner or later, we will have to change this strategy in order to make progress. Mr Goebbels and Mr Bullmann have, moreover, tabled a good amendment to enable us to do this. Secondly, the European Parliament should be able to make straightforward choices. In my opinion, the two reports, for which the committees voted unanimously, contradict one another. I support the Bullmann report, which recommends public investment and social legislation. However, I cannot support the report by Mr Gasòliba i Böhm which concentrates on deregulation and flexibility alone. I would like to stress, moreover, that if the internal market does not reach its goal in terms of essential services such as energy and transport, it is not due to deregulation, but because of a lack of infrastructure and common public regulations. I would also like to say that I disagree with the endless reduction in social security contributions, which is still being called for, which absolves businesses of any responsibility and creates poor workers. Thirdly, and finally, we should indeed help every European social and civil operator to make a choice in terms of economic and social policy. Yet, people are not familiar with these methods of coordination. They have absolutely no idea what they entail. We should, therefore, give thought to our responsibilities. On this subject, may I remind you that, in December 1996, following a report that I had presented, Parliament voted in favour of a resolution which confirmed its intention to hold an annual conference of the European Parliament on fundamental choices in economic and social policy, following an interactive debate between the various national authorities and a public consultation with the key players in civil society. I believe that we could take up this proposal again, in order to attract the attention of the citizens.

 Madam President, we all rejoice in welcoming the peoples of the ten new Member States of the European Union. Enlargement brings the hope of peace, cooperation and valuable exchanges between peoples. Nevertheless, we must not deceive ourselves about the problems that confront us. In the countries that have just joined us, average gross domestic product per capita is equal to only 45% of the average in the Fifteen. In order to be considered, these countries have had to drastically restructure their economies. They were required to implement the liberal model, introducing market mechanisms with competition as their sole model, which was to the detriment of a social policy founded on solidarity and economic cooperation. At no time was the Commission willing to take into account the grave economic and social consequences of this headlong rush. The Europe that these countries have joined is, however, beset by crises. The Lisbon strategy, launched in 2000 with the aim of securing full employment and a very high level of competitiveness, has failed to achieve that. For the first time in ten years, the Commission has admitted that employment is falling and, like the Council, is worrying about how serious the movement towards de-industrialisation is. It has enacted one directive after another, opening up postal services, energy and air and rail transport to competition, while refusing to carry out any sort of serious review of how this might affect jobs, the environment and prices. At the Barcelona European Council, the Heads of State or Government decided by common agreement to defer the retirement age, but there is, all the same, an unsustainable contradiction between trumpeting the priority to be given to jobs and speeding up the introduction of more flexible working practices, cutting wage costs while allowing gigantic industrial mergers and restructuring to go ahead. Imprisoned by the thinking of the Maastricht Treaty and the Stability Pact, the Council and the Commission are refusing to face up to their consequences. This adds up to a heavy burden for the peoples. We are a long way from the objectives of the Treaty of Rome and its avowed intention to promote improved living and working conditions for the workforce, enabling them to have equal access to progress. The struggle for jobs and against social exclusion, for better purchasing power and working conditions, to maintain and extend the rights of businesses’ workers, must become the European Union’s first practical priority, although defence and the improvement of public services must not be forgotten. This will require a profound change in the EU’s economic and monetary policies, which are guided solely by the demands of the financial markets and rules of competition that stifle any industrial strategy. The objectives of the European Central Bank must be redrafted to include job-creating investments and industrial projects. Giving the European project a new direction will mean abandoning dogmatism and accepting the need to reflect on other options and discuss them. No employment strategy can be crowned with success unless workers really are given the power to intervene to suspend planned redundancies, and to halt the mergers in progress. Any merger agreement must include social clauses. There must be penalties for failure to abide by directives on the consultation of workers. Finally, Madam President, Europe, as a source of hope, calls out for that which is best in each people to be shared and pooled. The intervention of workers and citizens will be indispensable in building tomorrow’s Europe. That is the Europe we are to build. What my group has done over the past five years has been a demanding labour, and many of the fields are still open.

Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, the debate this evening brings us to the end of numerous discussions and meetings regarding the future of the railways in Europe. A package has been completed, but it is also true that we have not yet completed the necessary revitalisation of the railways. At the end of this long and educational road, I would like to thank all my fellow rapporteurs who, despite differences of opinion, even seeing things in an entirely different way, have allowed us to work in a way that respected everyone’s points of view. As this discussion follows many others and closes the package, I would like to give an overall view of the proposals. In my opinion, this package is in line with the twofold reality of European integration today. It is also proof of the positive contribution that Europe can make to its people in order to tighten links and develop solidarity. The same applies to the reports on interoperability and the creation of the Rail Safety Agency. The aim of the ‘interoperability’ directive, for which I am rapporteur, was to bring the national networks forged by history into harmony with each other in order to achieve faster, more efficient and more harmonious transport. This is essential in order to revitalise rail transport and help international trade to flow more easily. It means that techniques need to be made coherent and that we need to ensure that the diversity of networks does not hinder traffic or cause delays. Considerable progress has been made in this respect and also on how we can achieve it. To give just one example, the black box proposal, which everyone welcomes today, was suggested to me right at the start of the debates by actual railwaymen, which shows that we have everything to gain from the participation of the main people involved. This is why, as rapporteur, I would particularly like to thank my colleagues in the Committee on Regional Policy, Transport and Tourism for helping me to complete this task, and also everyone within Parliament and outside, professionals and associations, who have helped me to look in detail into these questions and gain a better grasp of the issues at stake. This is also one of the main reasons why I welcome the report on the creation of the Rail Agency. Representatives of the profession, and in particular of employee organisations, will be on the board of directors of the agency. They will also have the opportunity to take part in working groups on the TSIs that affect them. Even though I wanted other improvements, in my view these two points demonstrate what Europe can gain by trusting and giving a voice to those who keep it going day by day. They deserve strong support from Parliament at the vote tomorrow. I now come to the other aspect of the twofold reality that I mentioned earlier. In my opinion, this package also reveals an ideological bias towards opening up markets and liberalisation. The unbridled race towards ever more liberalisation is one of the sources of discontent with Europe. The directive on opening up the networks proposes total liberalisation of freight, even though the first package has just been transposed and no serious, transparent and balanced evaluation has been conducted on its effects. Moreover, a date for the total liberalisation of passenger rail transport has been announced, prejudging the debate, which has not yet started, on the third package. I think we need to stop being deaf to the opposition expressed by all the rail workers’ unions in Europe. Even on a subject as important and decisive as safety, it is being proposed to us that the first Article be amended to place opening up to competition on the same level as safety. In my view, this is sending a bad signal. I do not wish to repeat what, as my colleagues know, I have already said several times on this matter. I will simply say that, on issues of such importance, with the experiences that we have had in Europe, it is worth adhering to the precautionary principle.

Mr President, Mr Sterckx’ sound report does in fact take into account the important data confirmed during the months of work by the Temporary Committee. Among other things, the report incorporates the necessary criticism of the Spanish authorities regarding management of the tragic disaster of the Prestige
. It deplores the fact that it has been made impossible for the master of the vessel to leave Spain during his trial. It asks the essential questions concerning the amount of fuel still on board and the dangers that remain as a result. It emphasises strict monitoring of adherence to shipping routes and the coordination of measures to be taken in the event of an accident; it recommends that the Maritime Safety Agency should have more power. Finally, the report would like to see better protection for the Baltic, a better instrument for tracing dangerous vessels in order to locate them in the event of a disaster. It also formulates a number of requirements concerning international legislation. Although all these proposed measures are positive, they do not, even so, seem to me to go far enough compared to the measures already proposed in the Erika I
 and II
 packages, even though the measures in these packages are indeed important and must be welcomed. Much was expected of this report from the Temporary Committee, and, indeed, it still is. I am sorry that the amendments calling for better cooperation and coordination of national actions have not been accepted in favour of a European coastguard service, which my group does not support. Before the vote just now, following the example of Mrs Bergaz, I am going to stress a number of proposals which we wish to have taken into account in the report and which can be found in the amendments proposed by my group and others. Safety at sea will not be improved without a review of the conditions under which seafarers work, without an end to the overexploitation that is to be found on many vessels, and without offering worthwhile pay with harmonisation at European level. Stronger measures against flags of convenience are essential. It is also necessary to look seriously at how to make the main parties responsible, shipowners, charterers, owners of cargoes and classification societies pay. What is more, the question of full compensation for the victims of the Prestige
 still remains unresolved. I myself truly believe that the report is worthy of our support, but I am anxious to say that my group will look carefully at how its proposals are taken into account in the vote on the amendments in order to decide on its final vote.

Mr President, Commissioner, it is indeed the case that, in December 2004, the European Union will have to set a date for the opening of negotiations with Turkey on its future accession. This is certainly a highly significant step. I must say, on behalf of the majority of my group, that Turkey should take its place as a full member of the European Union. It is a country whose history and geography make it part of Europe. Contrary to what some people have claimed, either openly or behind a veil of spurious pretexts, the problem with Turkey is not its religious identity. Certain political elements, moreover, are still trying to exert pressure to have the so-called Judaeo-Christian foundations of Europe enshrined in the draft Constitution in order to make it difficult or even impossible for Turkey to accede to the Union. Be that as it may, the problem with Turkey is its political system, dominated by the armed forces and by the national laws and constitution, which are still far from compatible with democratic principles; the problem also lies in its unacceptable treatment of the Kurdish minority, even though that minority accounts for a quarter of the entire population. Admittedly, since 2001 Turkey has been pursuing a reform process based on the Copenhagen criteria. As this House has observed on several occasions, however, these reforms leave a number of significant restrictions on the full enjoyment of fundamental rights and freedoms. The report by the Committee on Foreign Affairs, Human Rights, Common Security and Defence Policy also endorses this analysis, having incorporated amendments tabled by our group, particularly those concerning Leyla Zana, the Kurdish question and the recognition of the genocide committed against the Armenians. It is true that Turkey has not always had a coherent framework enabling it to guarantee political, civil, economic, social and cultural rights. Its current constitution was adopted in 1982, under the military regime, and still bears the seal of authoritarianism. The armed forces continue to play a predominant role in political, economic and cultural life and in the education system. They are the very cornerstone of the state and society and are therefore one of the main obstacles to the development of Turkey towards a democratic and pluralist system of government. Change is slow, involving homeopathic remedies and often designed to bring about superficial improvements, and we cannot fail to recognise that there remain some very serious problems. Leyla Zana, who won the Sakharov Prize awarded by the European Parliament, and three other former Members of the Chamber of Deputies of Kurdish origin who were convicted in 1994, remain in prison. The appeal process that we helped to initiate is being conducted in appalling conditions, as the European Parliament delegation, on which Feleknas Uca and Luigi Vinci represent my group, has observed at every hearing. Leyla Zana and her colleagues even refused to take part in the twelfth hearing in protest against these new proceedings in which their fate is a foregone conclusion. The Kurdish HADEP party has been banned, and the DEHAP party is under similar threat. Numerous judgments of the European Court of Human Rights are still being disregarded. Proceedings have been initiated against people for nothing more than a peaceful expression of their opinion. Human-rights activists are subjected by the authorities to harassment and intimidation or criminal investigation. The rights of trade unions are not guaranteed. Torture and maltreatment are still rife, particularly in police stations and prisons. Minorities are victims of discrimination, one example being the Kurds, whose economic, social and cultural rights have yet to be fully recognised. I listened carefully, Commissioner, to everything you said, but some questions remain unanswered with regard to Cyprus, particularly in relation to the continuing military occupation of the northern part of the island. Lastly, all of these factors prompted our colleague from the Committee on Foreign Affairs, Human Rights, Common Security and Defence Policy to write in his report, and I quote: ‘Meeting the political criteria of Copenhagen is a precondition for opening accession negotiations’. For the majority of my group, the democratisation of the Turkish institutions, genuine respect for fundamental rights, recognition of the rights of the Kurdish people, the release of Leyla Zana and the resolution of the Cypriot question are fundamental criteria which must be met if we are to approve the opening of accession negotiations with Turkey.

 Mr President, Mr Belder’s report makes a number of comments and proposals in line with the recommendations from the Council concerning relations between the Union and Russia. I support the two main lines pursued in the report. First, the reaffirmation of the desire to develop the vital partnership between the European Union and Russia. Russia is a big country and it is essential to develop economic relations with her in the areas of industry, research, health and energy. Common ambitions and objectives must be set, as the rapporteur proposes. They are of strategic and political importance. We must set priority objectives, such as cross-border cooperation in the fight against crime, defence of human rights, democracy, independence of news media and the rule of law, cooperation to resolve conflicts in the region and disarmament; we must also promote improvements to public health and social development. The second line pursued in the report seeks to be more critical, especially concerning basic freedoms and democratic rights in Russia. I agree with the rapporteur when he deplores the weakness of the Union’s role in the Chechen conflict, which has caused more than 200 000 deaths in ten years and is really genocide. The report calls on the Russian authorities to investigate the disappearances, torture and all violations of human rights. In November 2003, several of us intervened following President Berlusconi’s statements justifying the Russian military’s intervention policy. Europe must indeed play a much greater role in strongly and clearly condemning Russia in its handling of the war in Chechnya. There will not and cannot be a military solution in Chechnya. The desire for a partnership between the European Union and Russia must follow a plan that includes peace and security for all peoples. Europe can no longer be content with mere rhetoric. It must act and, from that point of view, the report is a step in the right direction.

Mr President, Commissioner, the proposed regulations being put to the vote today are the result of an agreement made in conciliation following months of debate and work. On behalf of my group, I abstained on this agreement, but I support the steps forward made from the initial draft. Firstly, after various air disasters, the issue of safety remains the priority for any approach in this field. Therefore, from the start I looked at these reports mainly from the point of view of safety. I had expressed my regret in this House regarding the ideological bias that was placing liberalisation at the heart of the measures proposed. It was a bias that was aiming to make economic issues the regulator for air activity and the main method of improving things. In my view, the agreement reached now has a much more realistic approach. Cooperation between civilian and military air traffic will be promoted, insofar as it is compatible with the sovereignty of the Member States, even though I would have hoped for a more dynamic approach in this area. The airspace blocks will be based on operational or functional requirements, irrespective of national borders, in consultation with Eurocontrol. In the event of a dispute, the Member States will, if they wish, be able to jointly request the opinion of a Single Sky Committee, the body responsible for implementing the plan. Chaired by the representative of the Commission, this committee will be made up of two representatives of each Member State and a representative of Eurocontrol. The agreement allows the Member States the freedom to entrust air monitoring to a public service or a private company. I see these proposals as positive developments. Although there is not the initial plan to dismantle the chain of so-called ancillary services, I nevertheless regret the fact that it was not more clearly recognised that the management of air navigation safety is a chain of actions and services that requires a global approach rather than a piecemeal one. I still regret the fact that Parliament did not wish to retain the amendment that I had tabled on behalf of my group aimed at doubling monitoring mechanisms in order to ensure that operations continue in complete security in the event of a fault. I still think that the absolute rule of obligatory separation of functions between the service providers and the national monitoring authorities does not necessarily take into account the complex realities of decisions in sectors that are so inter-related. I also think that the issue of air traffic control and of everything involved with the regulation and safety of air traffic are tasks that are the responsibility of the public authorities, who should be considered as public services. I have met the operators. I have worked a great deal with the unions on this matter. I wish to thank them and say that their contributions counted towards the positive progress that we have made. I also think that in the future, the points of view of the main people involved, the employees, should be better taken into account. This is one of the conditions necessary in order for other improvements to be made and also for the measures that will be taken in Europe to be effective. You can be sure that my group is determined to contribute to this. This is the reasoning for my vote, aiming to both take into account the progress made and show how much there is left to do.

Mr President, in spite of the power of work that Mr Herzog has put into this report, I have to say from the outset how far the report, as adopted by the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs, has fallen short of our hopes and expectations for a vigorous European instrument on services of general interest. My group cannot accept it. The text has become an ode to liberalisation with one single aim in mind, namely to make competitive market forces the sole regulator of service provision. Recital H, for example, emphasises that liberalisation in leading sectors in the internal market is a factor in technological progress and economic efficiency, while paragraph 13 welcomes the liberalisation that has taken place in the fields of telecommunications, postal services, transport and energy. Even the moderate proposal calling on the Commission to perform without delay a precise and comparative evaluation of the real impact of the policy of liberalisation of services of general interest before embarking upon further liberalisation, a proposal contained in the Langen report which was approved by this very House, is not endorsed in this report. On spurious pretexts, the report also discards the aim of a framework directive in which services of general interest and the obligations they entail for governments as well as for public and private operators could be defined more precisely. Only basic education and social protection would remain in the public sector. This is far removed from the sort of approach that is absolutely essential for the protection of people’s fundamental rights to energy and water supplies, transport, housing, communications and information. The purpose of services of general interest should be to guarantee these rights in accordance with a number of principles, namely equal access for everyone, information, consultation, user and worker participation and financial viability. It is impossible to achieve this ambition by relentlessly continuing to pursue the sole aim of liberalisation. This text is unacceptable as it now stands. The hopes and expectations aroused by the Green Paper were that public services would play a pivotal role in guaranteeing economic, social and environmental rights, that the true ambition of Europe was to satisfy the needs of the greatest number in a society characterised by solidarity. It follows from these remarks that my group will support all the amendments that are designed to remove the constantly recurring references to liberalisation and those which strengthen a model of services of general interest that are worthy of the name. My group reaffirms the need for an evaluation. It emphasises that services of general interest are elementary public services. It also expresses its desire to confirm unambiguously the right of local and regional authorities to choose freely the way they administer the services of general interest for which they are responsible. These things, at the very least, must be guaranteed if the services of general interest are to be an engine of solidarity in Europe.

 Mr President, Commissioner, the only words that are fitting for the terrible disaster of Sharm el-Sheikh are sadness and compassion and I want again to express my solidarity with the victims’ families and share in their grief. Obviously, it is impossible today to determine the causes of this accident and to say who was responsible. I am also aware that air transport is not without risks. No airline is immune from accidents. Having said that, we who carry political responsibility are involved, we have a particular responsibility because this accident has highlighted a number of questions that cannot be avoided. I would like, in the time that is given me, to go over those that seem to me the most important. The first question concerns States. Why did two States, France and Switzerland, take different decisions about the condition of aircraft belonging to the same airline? Was it due to inadequate cooperation or inadequate controls? How are the SAFA programmes applied? Important as they are, they are no substitute for thorough technical controls. Information should be automatic and transparent, with mandatory inspection on the slightest suspicion. As things in fact stand, as you said, there are no sanctions for states that fail to carry out inspections. I share Mrs de Palacio’s concern that it should be possible for a particular or reinforced protection measure adopted by one Member State in order to ensure safety to be extended to the whole Community. The second question is concerned with the safety consequences of the liberalisation of air transport. As you said, Commissioner, it is a global problem. With the growth of charter flights and low-cost fliers, airlines are engaged in keen competition. Cost cutting is certainly involved, but on what terms is that possible? There is a great temptation to cut back on training, maintenance or staff, and safety is threatened. Does not the European Union’s vaunted obsession with favouring the lowest economic cost in aviation help to make that the only regulator? The third question has to do with checks on aircraft that are a safety risk. The proposed directive, which was again submitted in January 2002, has still not been adopted. We must demand strict safety guarantees for all aircraft using the Union’s airports, step up controls and further harmonise joint technical regulations, including those concerned with flight and rest times. The Council should stop prevaricating and really get down to much stricter and more transparent safety rules. Finally, if we are to be effective legislators, we must call on the industry’s professionals. Pilots, technicians and other professionals have irreplaceable experience in this field. It is very useful to listen to them. That is the reason for the initiative my group has taken for a hearing to be held here on Wednesday afternoon. I also want in a few words to give my opinion on the EU-US agreement on the transmission of data relative to transatlantic flights. For the fight against terrorism, data would be transmitted in 34 fields, including the racial origins, political opinions, religious convictions and state of health of passengers, whereas the national authorities competent for the protection of privacy had reduced that list to 19. Moreover, the US authorities want to pass that data to US surveillance networks. It seems to me that this agreement isolates the European data protection directive and, in the light of European legislation, I do not think we can agree to the transfer of this data.

 Mr President, I am very pleased about today’s debate within our Parliament on the latest summit between the European Union and Russia. This is, in a sense, a response to the declarations issued by Mr Berlusconi on Chechnya at the end of the summit, declarations that justified the Russian policy of military intervention in the region. Such statements do not reflect the positions agreed by the Fifteen, and my group vigorously condemns these declarations. Europe has expressed its disagreement with this justification, but can that be considered enough? I do not think so. I deplore the very relative importance accorded by the Council and the Commission to the issue of Chechnya, as well as the lukewarm nature of the condemnations of the Kremlin during the summit. Daily life in Chechnya is still an ordeal for the civilian population. Lack of security, disappearances and human rights violations for which the Russian military forces are responsible continue with complete impunity. Over and over again, Moscow uses the fight against terrorism as an argument for justifying everything. That is unacceptable, even if it is, of course, necessary strongly to condemn the attacks by groups of Chechen extremists. In the opinion of the independent NGO observers, the would-be democratic election held on 5 October was a sham. My group questions the legitimacy of such a consultation, aimed solely at convincing the international community that the situation in the region has been normalised and that the people have been able to exercise their sovereignty. In fact, there is no such sovereignty. It is a matter of urgency that the EU should finally condemn Russia, clearly and in no uncertain terms, for its handling of the war in Chechnya. It will not be possible for the reconstruction of this wounded country to begin until after the Russian forces have withdrawn and full peace has been brought to the region. Only genuine political negotiations may enable the way to be opened to a process of democratisation and reconstruction, in which Europe must play a major role by exercising much stronger pressure upon Russia. Why not in the framework of the partnership agreements? Another possibility might consist in supporting the UN’s provisional administration plan in Chechnya. Such an attitude should not be interpreted as going against Russia or the development of the partnership between the European Union and Russia but, instead, as placing ourselves at the service of a peace and security awaited by both peoples.

 Mr President, Commissioner, this is, indeed, not the first time that this directive has been debated. I continue to think that it is a liberal directive that has one sole priority: the reduction of costs, to the detriment of security, employment and the quality of services. Indeed, the major problem lies with self-handling. Even with self-handling restricted to on-board crew and always assuming that, as remains to be seen, this will have no effect upon the social legislation of the Member States, ships’ crews or specially taken-on workers will, as you pointed out, be able to carry out loading and unloading operations in place of current qualified staff. Whether one likes it or not, self-handling amounts to allowing social dumping, even if it is now accompanied by references to security and to staff being qualified. Such a system would be dangerous to people because it would permit practices prejudicial to security: insufficient qualifications, ignorance of the locality and of instructions, a lack of understanding of the language and insufficient training. Any shipowner would, in this way, be able to call upon cheap labour, which would be dangerous for the ports and their environment. This problem also affects professions other than dock work, particularly those of the inshore and other pilots excluded in the first version and those connected with towing, which are subject to constraints in relation to the port authorities. I would add that, because the Council did not hold back the authorisations that had to be requested by the owners before having recourse to self-handling, the result will, as my fellow MEP Mr Savary said, be the introduction of the law of the jungle into the whole sector. Uncertainty is in this way being brought to bear upon all the qualified staff who until now have contributed to port security: the dockers who fulfil a very important economic task in difficult conditions by preserving security; and nautical services such as inshore and other pilotage services, universally recognised as services of general interest. All these sectors should be considered as essential partners contributing to the objective of maritime security and sustainable development. The proposal submitted to us cannot but have serious social consequences in the ports, and where employment too is concerned. There has been no genuine consultation of the interested parties. We are today being asked to vote in favour of a text that is rejected by all the professionals working in the ports. This is, it has to be said, a curious conception of democracy. Yesterday evening, here even in Strasbourg, employee representatives again met the groups to explain to them their points of view and to sound the alert. I think we must not remain deaf to this alert. These people have arguments we have to listen to. In conclusion, I am anxious, finally, to say that I think it is impossible to reflect upon this directive by removing it from the context of our debates on maritime security. Our Parliament has come out in favour of a temporary committee of inquiry on the Prestige
. We have had a lot of discussion in this House of the various measures in favour of maritime security and, Commissioner, you have put forward rational proposals. Personally, I never forget that, in the various meetings I was able to have on the French coast, all the maritime professionals always insisted, following the damage caused by the Prestige
, that security began in the ports. You spoke about coherence. Having said that, I find there is incredible incoherence in taking, on the one hand, positive measures concerning maritime security and, on the other hand, effectively destroying these with the decision on self-handling. In the interests of security, employment and the sustainable development of the European ports, we have to reject this document.

 Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, an entire programme of parliamentary and institutional work on railways is now drawing to a close. The railways represent a tremendous challenge for Europe and for the future. The report on interoperability seeks to make the directives on high-speed and conventional rail systems more consistent. Significantly, it also proposes greater harmonisation. This is a way in which the Union can benefit the railways, enabling trains to move freely across the European network. The decision to tackle the issue of rail was made on the basis of the ongoing decline of rail as a means of transport in Europe. Consequently, the proposals contained in my report seek to support the development of the railways. Rail is a sustainable and safe means of transport. In addition, it places different areas on an equal footing. Both at a European level and at the level of each Member State, public authorities should take resolute action on railways. They need it. The reasons for the decline of the railways are many and serious. Moreover, some of these reasons are not related to the aim of my report. One such reason is the failure to take account of the environmental costs of road transport, which is the main competitor of rail transport. The decline of the railways is also linked to problems concerning finance. On this issue, I am bound to refer back to what I said previously and I can only reiterate that this aspect is far from satisfactory. The time will come when it will be necessary to make available means that match our stated ambitions. I would now like to turn to the recommendation for second reading of my report. Although there was general agreement on the common position, my report includes the proposals made by the relevant parliamentary committee at first reading. This is progress. I would like to cite two examples. First, there is the proposal seeking to equip trains with recording devices. With satellite control, these devices will greatly enhance the flow of rail traffic by monitoring changes in real time. They will also increase safety. Rail employees put this proposal to me at the very beginning of the first reading and it has now been accepted by the Council. In my opinion, this is a good example of how we can improve parliamentary work by taking the time to debate issues with the main parties involved and to listen to them. Ladies and gentlemen, I would also like to draw your attention to the amendment seeking to replace the phrase ‘minimum level of safety’ with ‘optimum level’. It was important to eliminate any ambiguity concerning the possibility of a ‘levelling down’ type of harmonisation. Allowing safety standards to differ between Member States might suggest that harmonisation could be used to reduce safety standards so as to facilitate access for new entrants. On the contrary, it is essential to ensure that all rail users respect the complete set of standards guaranteeing better safety. I would now like to turn to the other reports on the rail package. I support the proposals of my fellow Member Mr Savary on a European Railway Agency. I think the proposals for each and every one of the players to be represented on the Administrative Board of the agency are essential to progress. I believe it is very important for rail employees and their organisations to contribute to the process of drawing up the technical specifications for interoperability (TSIs). I agree with a number of the proposals made by Mr Sterckx on safety. I believe each Member State’s particular situation and know-how must be taken into account. In addition, however, I feel it is important to allow sufficient time. For historic reasons, our rail networks are extremely complex. Effective change must take account of the human factor. I would also like to highlight the issue of national standards. It is essential for Member States to retain the right and the ability to improve their safety conditions and systems. If this right were removed, there would be a serious risk of them all being reduced to the lowest common denominator when the aim should be to help all networks increase their safety levels. Lastly, our rapporteur will understand that I do not agree with amending our objectives, including opening up the sector to competition and considering this action to be as important as safety. Everyone has their own opinion on opening up the sector to competition. We happen not to agree on the subject. It is, however, a shame to make a hotchpotch in a directive that has harmonisation and improvement of safety as its main objective. As for Mr Jarzembowski’s report, I have to say that I do not share his desire for liberalisation. We have only just begun on the process of transposing the previous directive and an assessment of its impact is required. The rail sector is of such social and economic importance that the precautionary principle must be applied. No one would want the European rail system to experience the same mishaps, not to mention disasters, which have befallen certain other networks. Liberalisation at any cost implies certain theoretical assumptions. This can prove dangerous and has been shown to have disastrous consequences for the railways, employment and the social and economic situation. These are the grounds on which we rejected the proposals to accelerate the opening up of both the national and international freight sector, proposals which unfortunately were accepted by the Council. Since we rejected these proposals, it follows that we cannot support Parliament’s bid to liberalise passenger transport if the report is accepted. All, or almost all, of the main players in the sector are united in their opposition to this plan. This support for liberalisation is all the more surprising given that the attempts to establish freight corridors have not yet borne fruit save in the context of cooperation. Europe needs to learn from experience. It also needs a public rail service it can be proud of. In our opinion, this is what is at stake. Lastly, while I agree with Mr Jarzembowski’s idea that the rail package constitutes a whole, and while we all agree on promoting rail transport, and moving forward in this direction, I do not think this necessarily entails liberalisation.

 Mr President, I welcome the publication of the Commission Green Paper on European space policy in conjunction with the European Space Agency (ESA). In my view, this Green Paper demonstrates an awareness of the importance for Europe of developing the space sector in industrial, strategic and also political terms. Last May, we held a debate on the future of this sector, in light of a serious crisis related to fierce world competition and to funding problems. The Green Paper, the Bodrato report and the newly announced White Paper contain practical proposals that could ultimately help us to overcome this crisis and finally add some real ambition to an independent European space policy. To this end, I welcome the outcome of the Galileo programme and I share the stated desire to develop Community integration. I do hope, however, that this integration will not call into question the independent competences of the space agency in its role as programme coordinator and leader. I should like to address two issues. The report insists on the need to create synergies between civilian and military activities – I heard Mr Bodrato’s words quite clearly – whilst advocating the use of space for peaceful purposes, which I support. He hopes that the satellite systems will benefit not only transport and the environment, but also security, so that Europe has its own strategy, management body and its own resources. All well and good, but I am convinced that priority should be given to the use of space for peaceful purposes: the needs are enormous, whether we are talking about the environment or about risk management. Europe must not fall in line with the US model, which gives priority to research and development in the military sphere above any potential civilian applications. Lastly, one crucial aspect of an ambitious European space policy concerns funding. The report emphasises that the provision of public funds is crucial to the development of space programmes. There is a major contradiction between the Union’s stated aims and reality. There has been no increase in the budgets allocated to Europe’s space agencies, whereas the US dedicates six times more public funds to space than do all the European countries put together. The Union must, as a matter of urgency, release funding that matches the ambitions it has stated. This is also a requirement for Community integration and, as I see it, only public funds can guarantee long-term investment, which is crucial in the space industry, as is maintaining high-level skills. This is a prerequisite for an independent, dynamic European space policy that uses cutting-edge technology and which creates high-quality jobs.

 Mr President, Commissioner, the report by Mr Andersson stresses the need to take account of the poverty suffered by many pensioners and the inequalities between the pension entitlements of men and women. With this in mind he recommends a sufficient level of minimum guarantee pensions and increasing the employment level among women in a bid to promote equal opportunities. I and my group agree with these parts of the report. Mr Andersson even indicates that he is anxious to ensure that a balance is struck between social and financial concerns. Unfortunately, this undertaking is contradictory and causes the rapporteur to call into question fundamental social principles in the name of financial criteria. Indeed the vote in the committee was not unanimous. We did not vote in favour of this report in the parliamentary committee because it supports the Commission's proposal to raise the retirement age. In so doing, it aligns itself with the liberal approach, manifest at many European Councils in the past, which advocates greater flexibility and increased working time. We are opposed to this kind of reform, which imposes increased working time and yet does nothing to resolve the employment issue. The report claims that the Member States have taken measures that are heading in the right direction, which is to say towards increased working time. Given that a majority of workers in France, Austria and Germany have demonstrated that they reject a move towards increased working time and funded pension provision, do we wish to settle the European debate on pensions without public involvement? With my group's support, we are tabling amendments that seek to reflect these aspirations. In them, we of course oppose raising the statutory retirement age and extending the contributions period. We are also opposed to funded pension provision, which provides no guarantee of an income and undermines the principle of solidarity inherent in pay-as-you-go schemes. We propose that contributions be calculated taking into account how hard the work is and the number of dependent children. Finally, we propose studying new ways of financing legal pension schemes. The argument of increased life expectancy is used to broach the issue of funded pension schemes; this does little to mask the financial appetites of multinationals in favour of this option. There are other ways to resolve the issue of financing in the long term that are more viable and characterised by greater solidarity. We propose, for example, extending social security contributions to all revenue, with the amount adjusted depending on whether the companies are creating jobs or not. These proposals do not appear to me to be entirely irresponsible. In conclusion, I would say that faced with mounting criticism of the choices made in this field by Europe's Heads of State or Government, what matters now is to listen to the demands that people are making and not to go against them, unless we wish to see the people of Europe grow even more disaffected with the Union.

 Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, like preceding speakers, I too wish to congratulate the rapporteur, Mr Sterckx, on the work he has accomplished in quite difficult conditions and on the close attention he has paid during the many debates that have taken place on the matter. I believe that this report will enable real progress to be made towards achieving greater maritime safety. I shall, therefore, confine myself to reiterating a few points on which I feel there is still room for improvement. The passing of time has revealed new aspects of the sinking of the Prestige
 and we now know, for example, about the astounding quantity of fuel leaking from the tanks which, we have been told, should have been emptied. I also believe that a temporary committee of inquiry is now more appropriate than ever. It is crucial for determining the causes and consequences of the sinking as objectively as possible, so that we can take the best decisions for the future. The European public would find it hard to understand why our Assembly is not proposing or accepting that just such a committee should be set up. My second point is this: how can we fail to note that those responsible for these disasters are not the people who bear the heaviest financial, economic and social costs? The reign of irresponsibility and impunity must be brought to an end. It is a fact that most of these disasters do not have natural causes and are often the result of actions and management methods that are solely focused on the quest for profit, to the detriment of all other considerations. Consequently, money set aside for investment in the quality of vessels, in their upkeep and in the social conditions and training of seafarers is ceaselessly being whittled away. In this quest for profit, the honest people in the business – and there are a few of them – who do invest in safety are penalised. We must now, therefore, set up a system of compensation in which those who are responsible, the charterers, shipowners, owners and insurers pay for all the damage caused. The victims should be properly and fully compensated. Although Mr Sterckx’s report rightly raises the issue of flags of convenience and how to control them, I believe we should go further and ban vessels flying these flags in European waters, as Parliament called for in a previous resolution. Nor will we be able to resolve maritime issues without the assistance of sailors, without their knowledge, their skills and their representatives. Any decision should be taken in a process of cooperation with those who earn their living at sea and who care about it. I believe that this does not currently happen as often as it should. Lastly, I wish to draw attention to one further point. These debates on issues of maritime safety highlight the importance of actions that are public-spirited and socially responsible. Today, however, what is universally advocated is a policy of liberalisation. In the name of competition, there is a permanent quest to bring down costs. Are higher costs not precisely the price we must pay for improving safety? I believe that Europe must, on maritime issues as on others, take the standpoint of public responsibility, which states loudly and clearly that the main criterion is safety, the world we live in and the lives of those who inhabit it.

 Madam President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, Mrs Lambert’s report presents an entire set of extremely interesting measures. The main aim of the report is to ensure that persons moving within the EU do not suffer disadvantages in their social security rights. For those of us in this Parliament who hope that cultural and human exchanges increase in the context of the free movement of persons, this report really is a step in the right direction. The simplification of regulations, coordination, the harmonisation of procedures based on the application of the principle of equal treatment, which gives employees or self-employed persons from other Member States the same rights as the citizens of the state responsible, all contribute to European integration. Some measures contained in the report are particularly noteworthy. Personally, I find that they are very much in step with the changes that have taken place in our societies. I am thinking in particular of the desire to treat maternity and paternity equally, the proposal seeking to include third-country nationals in the directive’s scope, and even the definition of the term ‘member of the household’ applying to unmarried partners in a long-term relationship, irrespective of sex. Although I, together with my group, do support this report, I wish, Commissioner, to underline the paradox between the stated desires and the dangers of adopting measures less comprehensive than those provided by the social security systems in several European countries. France, Italy and Germany, for example, are about to implement or have already implemented reforms intended to break up existing social security systems, on the pretext that they have excessive budgetary deficits in terms of the Maastricht criteria. By extending the sphere of operations of private bodies, we will be moving towards a reduction of national assistance or even its total disappearance, which could prove extremely dangerous for the future. And yet, the principles and aims underpinning the creation of social security systems in Europe still apply, in the context of developing a European social model that has proved itself by enabling growth and improved living standards for decades. I would add that these aims are all the more necessary given the increase in levels of precarity and poverty in Europe today. According to a recent Eurostat study, 15% of the Union’s inhabitants are at risk of poverty and social exclusion. If you take away all social transfers, this figure rises to 24% and the situation is in danger of worsening. The question facing us in Europe today goes far beyond establishing coordination, even though this is clearly crucial. What we are faced with is a real societal choice. Do we want a model of economic and social development that is equitable and provides assistance, which will enable us to stimulate growth, or will we take the route of allowing all social systems to disappear, at the risk of allowing the number of people in a precarious situation, the poor and the marginalised to skyrocket? Choosing the first option would require a genuine form of European social governance to be established, based on a form of downward harmonisation. This would clearly also involve reviewing the Maastricht criteria.

 Mr President, Commissioner, quite a few European countries have indeed suffered throughout this summer from exceptional temperatures. That is the subject of this evening’s debate and, indeed, time is now of the essence. The consequences of this heatwave for our countries and their populations have been appalling. In Portugal, as our fellow MEPs have pointed out, fires have destroyed 5% of the country. It is a national disaster. Regarding France, I wish first of all to express my feelings, including my indignation, at the extent of the human drama we have experienced. The French Government announced on Friday that more than 11 000 additional deaths in connection with the heatwave were recorded between 1 August and 15 August. These figures are terrifying. Certainly, they must encourage us to ask ourselves questions about each person’s duty of solidarity towards those who are most vulnerable. National governments, and particularly the French Government, ought however, just like the European Union, also to ask themselves questions about the importance of public health policies, the requirement for high-quality emergency hospital services, accessible to everyone and in sufficient numbers, as well as about the requirement for retirement homes staffed by trained personnel and with the resources to ensure high-quality services. In short, they must consider adopting an ambitious policy regarding the elderly and those who are most vulnerable. All this requires budgets and, therefore, political choices that direct public expenditure towards the satisfaction of everyone’s needs. Regarding the fires, which have particularly affected the Var region of France and, even more so, other European countries, we are faced with a certain number of questions. What aid should there now be for these affected regions? How should such crises be dealt with more effectively in the future? Above all, how might they be avoided and through what policy of prevention? These questions also apply to the terrible consequences of the drought for agriculture. Commissioner, you propose a certain number of answers to these questions, as well as guidelines for reflection, but, in both cases – those of fires and drought – emergency aid does indeed need to be organised – in the forms both of the European Solidarity Fund and of national aid – in support of the regions damaged by the fires. For farmers, many of whom are faced by drastic situations, the European Union ought, as a minimum, to authorise the national governments to accord them exceptional short- and medium-term aid. In France, the consequences for the affected areas are overwhelming: a loss of 50% to 100% of production is anticipated for non-irrigated cereals in the department of Lot-et-Garonne. There is a lack of fodder, directly threatening livestock. Everywhere, farmers are faced with a very large decline in revenue. Alongside this aid, thought must be given to the mechanisms to be put in place, as well as to the efficient management of the crises linked to exceptional natural events. This also requires public funds, which have no place in a competitive rationale. Finally, I would turn to prevention and causes. In line with other fellow MEPs, I really wish to emphasise the need to re-think current models of rural planning and of agricultural and also transport development. Clearly, the tendency to make more and more profit out of available land, not to invest in fire prevention on the pretext of making savings, to accord priority to large farms and yield and to favour road transport, always to the detriment of rail – I could go on – is full of dangers. Another model is in actual fact to be devised, based on genuinely taking account of the environment, of the public interest and of solidarity. Indeed, we must show very much greater determination to apply the Kyoto Protocol. In conclusion, however, I want all these dramas experienced by our fellow citizens over the last few weeks to enable us at least to become more aware. … (The President cut off the speaker)

Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, after the first reading in Parliament, the Council’s common position is, in my opinion, an important stage in the construction of a Community policy for air navigation. Although the approach that prevailed in the Council bears the stamp of realism in a number of areas, I regret that it did not attack certain provisions more. I will come back to this. The requirement for a separation of functions between service providers and the national monitoring authorities is, like the requirement for certification of service providers, a structuring measure. If it is about affirming the desire to distinguish the role of the operator and that of the regulator and increase transparency, the requirement should take into account the real situations that show that different concepts can also work. In any case, I think it is reasonable for each Member State to retain the choice of how things operate in their countries. I regret that it has not been clearly recognised that the management of air navigation security was part of a chain of actions and services that needed an overall, rather than a divided approach. I am even more convinced of this approach after spending two days last week at the annual conference of the ‘air navigation’ group of the ETF unions. I am happy to talk about dividing up, but I think that we also need to talk about the human factor. We can always reduce the staff in control centres, but it is not acceptable for one section of airspace to be managed by only one or two controllers: there are also human limits. At the same time, in terms of airspace, progress has been made in that a single European flight information area in the upper airspace has been created and in that the Commission has produced a common publication on aeronautical information in that area; these are established facts. Harmonisation would also be ensured for pricing of services. Regarding the organisation of airspace and service provision, everyone agrees that safety requires anticipation, research and agreement between States and the service providers concerned. The changes made to the initial text particularly concern recognising the sovereignty of the States over the airspace above them and pointing out the responsibilities of those States towards the ICAO. The Council thus reached the conclusion that the functional blocks of airspace, which have been the subject of many debates, will be established by the States concerned. Is this good or bad? I think that it is a process. It is also a question of recognising the fact that air control requires that prerogatives of the public powers be exercised and that it should not be of an economic nature justifying the application of the competition rules in the Treaty. In this way, it is the States that decide whether or not to give financial incentives to their service providers or users through taxes; this is the approach that I, personally, prefer. What matters, then, is that we recognise the central role that Eurocontrol must play in preparing measures delegated to the Commission, which are part of the responsibilities of that organisation; in my opinion, this is a step forward. Finally there is the recognition of the exclusive competence of the States in determining their defence operations, including processing them, which, I agree with you Commissioner, is not desirable. I would lean more towards putting civil before military in peacetime, which is undoubtedly the situation today. Having said this, the common position incorporates a large proportion of the amendments proposed by Parliament at first reading. I regret, nevertheless that the Council, like Parliament at first reading stage, was cautious about certain demands that I regard as sensible. I thus find it regrettable that my group’s proposal to double the control apparatus to ensure that operations continue if there is any failure, and the proposal to evaluate the correct implementation of the Directive, were not retained. I have met with the operators and worked a great deal with the unions on this matter. There are those employed in the sector who are already working in the European and world airspace and are determined to move Europe forward, and I think that we should listen to them. Hearing them means really involving them and not only consulting them. Europe will be made using people from different sectors and will require their active participation; I do not think that there is any future without them. To conclude, I regret nevertheless that the approach remains focused, on the whole, on the ideological premise that liberalisation brings efficiency, including in terms of safety, something that remains to be seen.

 The proposal for a directive on environmental liability is of great importance in ensuring improved environmental protection and combating all kinds of pollution. Whether we take the example of AZF
 in Toulouse in 2002 or the Erika
 and Prestige
 oil tankers, these disasters cost human lives and lead to serious, long-term environmental damage. The report by the Committee on Legal Affairs and the Internal Market proposes a more conciliatory position with regard to business interests, weakening the initial proposal for a directive. On the contrary, the provisions laid down should be strengthened with protection measures, making polluters bear the cost of environmental damage, giving NGOs and citizens the opportunity to take their case to court, and including in the directive damage caused by GMOs. At a time when the IOPCF has just announced a ludicrous compensation rate of 15% for the damage caused by the Prestige
, causing amazement and anger among the people and associations, and rightly so, Europe now has a duty to send out a completely different message. It must send out a clear message of justice and determination.

 Mr President, we are indeed facing a very unusual situation and I am glad this debate is being held tonight, even though, sadly, very few Members are present in the Chamber. In the face of the international competition that has developed in the field of launchers, and considerable funding problems, the European space industry is undergoing a very serious, even unprecedented, crisis, and we therefore urgently need to overcome this situation which threatens the very existence of Arianespace and find solutions. I would like to emphasise the fact that access to space is not just an industrial priority – it is also a requirement in terms of European identity and autonomy in a field in which we have acquired substantial competence. Space is all about research and highly important civil applications. We often consider it to mean the conquest of space, but I personally would say that space is mainly what we call useful space – telecommunications, observation satellites, medicine and disaster prevention. It is an area of excellence and competence and also an important source of skilled employment, providing 35 000 direct jobs in Europe, with a significant research sector. As you are aware, I would like to emphasise the need for the space sector to serve mainly peaceful objectives. I would join other Members in welcoming the fact that the development of the European space policy has been deemed a priority for the Sixth Community Framework-Programme for research and development. I was also pleased to note that the future of the European Space Agency is on the agenda for our part-session.  The European Space Agency is an effective intergovernmental coordination body that has contributed to the development of space applications in Europe and throughout the world. I therefore consider it necessary to establish a genuine European space policy with greater involvement of European Union competences in this field. I also believe that this is not incompatible with maintaining the autonomy of the Agency. The Union therefore needs to make a genuine commitment for the Agency to continue to develop as a coordinator and programme manager. Once again, I would like to reiterate what other Members have said. In order to establish an autonomous European policy we urgently need to overcome the impasse on the Galileo dossier and, at last – as we have endlessly repeated – ensure that the Member States overcome their differences to enact this programme and move towards its rapid implementation, relaunching the European launcher. I would, however, Commissioner – and I do not know whether this is a possibility – like the Commission to carry out a study on distortions in competition between Ariane and launchers from other countries on the civil commercial market. Although I share the concern and desire to make space a European project and concentrate on the necessary restructuring of the sector, I nevertheless have a few questions on the industrial restructuring that is currently underway, coming as I do from the Toulouse area. Under what conditions and for what purpose are they being carried out? I do not think that the European space sector suffers from increased competence. Quite the opposite. This would be to take a short-term view rather than an ambitious, long-term view. I believe that continuing to develop technological and human competence in the sector, rather than losing them, would be the real goal for Europe if, as stated, it is to possess an autonomous, competitive competence in this field. I too believe it is important to send a strong signal to the forthcoming Council of Ministers.

Thank you, Mr President, for everything that you have said, but allow me to also stress my point because Parliament has also followed all the Commission and Council initiatives to speed up the implementation of the ERIKA I and ERIKA II packages. You referred to the fresh measures taken regarding the IMO, but the reason why Parliament has proposed that flags of convenience be banned is that we are all well aware, in the debates that we have had following maritime disasters, that the nature of flags of convenience is that in the event of problems, it is incredibly difficult to locate those responsible. We are well aware that, throughout the chain that links the flag, the State, the captain of the boat and the various crews, it is no longer possible to determine in the end who we are going to ask to be held criminally and financially responsible, which is the reason for Parliament’s proposal. I must stress this. It is true that the Commission should take the initiative, but I would like to know how, as President-in-Office of the Council, you are going to support this proposal by Parliament.

 Mr President, we have already debated this directive on opening up all port services to competition at the first reading. Everyone has commented on it. The Council subsequently made its position known. We are faced with a liberal directive which, as usual, seeks solely to reduce costs, to the detriment of all other factors. Even though the rapporteur, Mr Jarzembowski, has met with a large number of people and has included a number of proposed improvements, the situation, the fundamental problem remains. There has been no genuine consultation with unions or others involved, despite the fact that these people are familiar with the safety and environmental requirements and have invaluable know-how. Furthermore, the fact that we are continuing to legislate against those employed in this sector was demonstrated this afternoon through the formidable dock workers’ demonstration. In this respect, I support the protest made by Mr Wurtz, the chairman of my group, to the effect that the attitude of the police towards the demonstrators was unacceptable. As he said, their protest is legitimate. Considering that their trade and their jobs are being destroyed, we cannot expect them to come to the European institutions bearing flowers. In addition, no prior assessment has been made of the effects of this liberalisation, especially as regards important issues such as employment, safety and the environment. According to my fellow Member, Mr Hatzidakis, liberalisation is not an aim in itself, but a means of economic development. Well, I am waiting for an evaluation! I want to know the impact of this on other sectors. We have been waiting for a while now. Regardless of the amendments incorporated, the text remains liberal. Whether we like it or not, self-handling at ports will be tantamount to permitting social dumping, despite the various safeguard clauses included. These refer to safety, to the qualifications required of staff and even to the nature of the seagoing personnel. This directive makes it possible to employ workers from outside the port to do the work of the qualified workers currently employed. The concept of self-handling will result in insecurity, worse working and employment conditions and worse environmental safety standards. This is a particularly retrograde step in light of the current practices of commercial fleets, which have shown that the consequences may be very serious for the European Union. Employees like dock workers fulfil a very important economic role in difficult conditions while maintaining safety standards. Services such as pilotage and mooring services are not covered by this directive, even though they are universally recognised as being services of general interest. I think all these sectors should be considered as partners in the pursuit of sustainable development. Lastly, following the damage caused by the Prestige
, I met with professionals from the maritime sector in France to discuss safety issues. They all insisted that maritime safety begins at ports. I therefore feel that the measures taken here after the sinking of the Prestige
 and the decision taken today to impose self-handling are totally contradictory. These, then, are the reasons why my group will continue to advocate rejection of the common position.

Mr President, I think that there is already a consensus emerging from the first few speeches: the Commission’s response and its proposal do not currently respond to the situation. Indeed, one can only note and condemn the increasing number of companies being restructured, along with restructuring programmes and redundancies with disastrous consequences, of course for employees, but also for entire regions that are devastated as a result. Many sectors are affected by this, particularly the steel industry. People say that the context of a slowdown in growth is not favourable. It is true that the majority of companies wear out this argument that restructuring and closures of sites are necessary in order to deal with international competition. However, let us state the fact that company management take a fundamentally financial approach and not always an industrial one, far from it, when defining their strategy. Their aim is to achieve maximum profitability, without worrying about the social or environmental consequences. That often leads to relocations to third countries where rules on such matters are practically non-existent. Commissioner, you referred to Metaleurop. It is true that even though that is about the metal industry and not specifically steel, it is a useful example: this very polluting company is going to shed thousands of jobs without taking any social or environmental responsibility. I think, however, that the situation raises the broader question of what ambitions Europe intends to have in terms of drawing up a new Treaty? Is the European Union going to accept such behaviour from companies which, we should remember, have greatly benefited from European political aid. You of course referred to existing legislation that needs to be applied. Nevertheless, I think that new measures need to be taken to inform unions and works committees about the aid received. Measures also need to be adopted forcing those companies to account for how they have used loans granted and to reimburse them if they do not respect the commitments made. When it comes to enlargement, which was referred to with regard to another company, Europe needs to equip itself with further resources in order to promote an ambitious industrial policy that will ensure that a strong steel sector is maintained and modernised, incorporating the necessary social and environmental standards within a framework of sustainable development. If that is not done, Commissioner, we will not move towards a Union of solidarity but towards a Union of terrible opposition between employees and between citizens. With regard to social governance, we need to legislate even more. I think that new European legislative texts need to be more effective in forcing companies established in the Union to take on their responsibilities. The Commission and the Member States need to adopt a more pro-active strategy in response to industrial restructuring and its social impact. I think that this is also a question of ethics. In a Europe that seeks to defend the fundamental rights of its citizens, can we stand by and do nothing while thousands of employees are thrown out onto the street as if they were just goods? It is precisely the opposite approach that we need to promote in order to have a fresh impetus for industry in Europe. Employees should have new rights in companies at all levels. I am of course referring to the legislation on European committees. However, I think that establishing democracy within boards of directors would prevent many companies from being forced into being restructured and into liquidation by management that is mainly bowing to financial pressure and is far from responding to industrial demands. I therefore think that the Union should force the companies concerned to do more to take into account the alternative proposals from unions before making any decisions.

 Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, the White Paper on European transport policy for 2010 is clearly in favour, and I welcome the fact, of shifting the balance between modes of transport towards rail and waterways. It defines priorities with a view to this shift: moving towards fair charging arrangements and acting to combat bottlenecks and environmental degradation, as well as giving a pivotal role to users. Like all the directives issued in this field, however, it is always the pursuit of liberalisation in all transport sectors that is emphasised, as if this were the only viable solution. Mr Izquierdo Collado’s report provides a series of amendments that should be supported with a view to respecting the environment. He also makes proposals for the harmonisation of fuel taxation and transport charges. With regard to road safety, I think it is good that he calls for the creation of a Road Safety Agency. Since I constantly tried to draw attention to the crucial issue of funding when the directive on rail interoperability was being drawn up, I fully agree with another of Mr Collado’s proposals, that seeking to create a European Transport Fund in order to ensure that the policies proposed are financially viable and credible. As you will have understood, however, I cannot support his backing for the liberalisation processes underway. We are examining directives on rail, air transport, and on nautical and technical services next week, all aiming to liberalise these sectors. We should, of course, support the call for the Commission to assess the consequences of liberalisation, as Mr Collado does. I believe, however, that we should also strengthen public services by modernising them. I believe that public services or services of general interest must be at the heart of the Union’s transport policy and must, as such, be incorporated into future Treaties. I think we genuinely need to shift the balance in transport towards rail, but we still need to make far more progress on the matter of distortion of competition, which remains significant, and, in particular, we should be far more resolute in demanding a reduction in driving time for lorry drivers, which is also a condition for increased safety. My group also considers that the report should be more concerned with social issues. A series of amendments has been tabled by my group, moreover, relating to the key issue of harmonisation of social standards from the top for all modes of transport. Transport naturally also includes maritime transport and, at a time when the Prestige
 disaster is still at the forefront of our minds, I would like to draw your attention to the amendment tabled by my group inviting the Commission to present a legislative proposal forcing polluters – oil companies, classification companies, ship owners and charterers – to pay for all damage caused by disasters in which they are involved. I would also like to point out that the European Parliament has requested a ban on flags of convenience and I would like the Commission to take swift measures in this regard. For all these reasons, you will understand that my group will wait in order to be able to take account of any progress due to the adoption of amendments before taking up a final position on this report.

 Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, given that the European Union has published a White Paper explaining the need to revitalise rail transport, it is essential to ensure interoperability within the European rail system if it is to be developed. This is crucial to the future of European railways in the twenty-first century. Rail is a more sustainable means of transport, entailing fewer external costs than road transport. It is also more environmentally friendly and safer. Despite all this, rail freight has declined over the last twenty years. It is my view that there are three main reasons for this decline. Firstly, we have industrial strategies favouring road transport and ‘just-in-time’ management, resulting in a greater number of journeys and greater dispersal and fragmentation. Furthermore, there is distortion of competition between road and rail transport. The level of social regulation relating to road transport is notably low when compared to that for rail. I am thinking, in particular, of the fact that the regulation outlined in the Markov report to be discussed this morning does not address the question of a limit on driving time adequately. Despite the fact that Mr Markov and the Committee on Employment and Social Affairs proposed reducing driving time to 45 hours, the limit remains at 56 hours, which is clearly still far too long. Lastly, I share the view that the development of different networks according to national specifications has limited trade and has lead to inadequate cooperation and incompatible standards. My report on the high-speed network and the conventional network respectively, therefore seeks to make standards more compatible by bringing the two existing directives into line with each other. The report also includes a series of proposals to speed up harmonisation and to extend its scope. I would like to point out that my report is closely linked to the report on establishing a European Railway Agency. Consequently, a number of decisions on points concerning the Agency are included in my report as they stand in order to ensure that the package is coherent. While preparing my report, I met with operators, experts, the Commission, trade unions and public authorities on many occasions. As a result of the meetings, I identified a number of issues to which I would like to draw your attention. Firstly, in order to achieve interoperability, I think it is absolutely essential to take full account of the skills and know-how of the professionals working within the sector. The European Union must ensure the involvement of the sector if it is to harmonise the rail system. For example, during one of the meetings I had with railway staff, they proposed a recording device. I took this on board, as I believed it to be relevant. The introduction of a recording device now has universal support and is included in my report. Secondly, further to all these meetings, it has become clear to me that harmonisation and safety rules are inextricably linked. Harmonisation in this area cannot be carried out at a minimum level. Safety standards vary across the European Union. Lowering safety standards to facilitate access to infrastructure would be counter-productive and even dangerous. Reducing safety would not be in the interests of harmonisation. One question remains unresolved, namely funding. Enormous investment is needed to achieve this new stage of development. No specific budgetary provision is envisaged, though this is certainly called for. I am delighted that agreement has been reached on Article 29 of the Sterckx report, which promotes social dialogue. I also consider the agreement reached on the Savary report to be very important. This concerns the participation of staff representatives in drawing up technical specifications on interoperability (TSIs) which are of direct concern to them. To ensure consistency between the various reports and the unity of the package, I would like to propose three oral amendments which take account of the agreements reached on the Sterckx and Savary reports. I would also like to propose an amendment on the financial questions. Whilst I am aware that not everyone will share my point of view, I hope you will all understand the importance of the issue. The package as a whole is extremely important, given what is at stake. We bear an enormous responsibility for the future, as we are planning the European rail system for the twenty-first century. I would in addition like to express my opinion on the package as a whole. The Jarzembowski report proposes the complete liberalisation of rail freight services by 2003, and of national passenger services by 2008. I must say that I am concerned about the proposals aimed at speeding up liberalisation, following up those proposed by the Commission. The transposition of the first package is only just taking place in Member States, and an assessment of the consequences has therefore yet to be undertaken. I am still concerned at the conclusions of the Barcelona Council, which sensibly called for a report to be drawn up and an assessment to be made before any new proposal is presented. I agree that we need to revitalise the rail system. It is my view that the harmonisation of standards is a very relevant issue, as is the need for an Agency and strict safety rules. I do not however see why and how it should be deemed necessary to undertake the development of the rail network and opening it up to competition at the same time. The Sterckx report on safety is also very important since, like the Commission, it is concerned in particular about the harmonisation of safety standards. The harmonisation of safety standards should, however, take account of the real situation of the sector, especially as regards implementation time. It would be useless, or even detrimental, to attempt to apply European standards too quickly. In conclusion, I would like to reiterate my conviction that both the long-term development and the revitalisation of the sector are at stake. The players in this sector count, be they operators or railway staff. Their skills and knowledge are valuable. The European Union can and must show that it intends to involve them in the development of the rail system. (Applause)

 Mr President, for unfortunate technical reasons the amendments I made to my report have not been tabled. Before we vote on each individual amendment, I would like to explain straightaway that to ensure the whole package is coherent I have decided to table some of these amendments as oral amendments. There are two amendments relating to the proposed new draft of Article 3 on the Agency. There is a recital relating to the amendment of Article 29 on safety. There is also another amendment which details my wish to pose the question of funding. Ladies and gentlemen, I would welcome your views on this.

First of all I would like to express my satisfaction with the report by Mr Markov supporting the Commission proposal of October 2001 for a new regulation on road transport. This report includes in particular the improvements made by the new regulation to the current situation, with the dual objective of increasing road safety and improving working conditions for drivers. Measures such as removing the possibility of dividing breaks, extending scope, increasing penalties for infringing the regulation, which are measures that appeared in the Commission proposal and are reiterated in the report, represent important milestones. The Markov report reinforces the regulation further, for example, by opposing the creation of a flexible week through the introduction of a limit on working time, by setting a fixed driving time or encouraging the participation of the social partners. I would particularly like to highlight the importance of the measure aimed at extending the scope of the regulation to all lorry drivers operating within European territory, whether or not they are EU nationals. This measure might consequently considerably reduce social dumping while encouraging third countries to strengthen their national legislation to improve working conditions for their drivers.

 Mr President, I welcome the fact that we are debating services of general interest once again, on the occasion of the Commission’s statement. I believe that services of general interest are at the heart of European integration, or rather that they ought to be. Although their place and role in the Union are indeed recognised, in principle, in Article 16 of the Treaty, they are still subject to competition rules, with all the ensuing consequences. There has been growing pressure for faster liberalisation in many sectors. The Brussels European Summit, last March, was a decisive moment in this sense, moreover. Energy, transport, a new era for the postal services sector: the recurring argument is that liberalisation would be the solution to the need to modernise these services. This is not true, as we can see from numerous examples. I believe that one of the functions of services of general interest is to ensure social and territorial cohesion. They must guarantee access to high quality services for all citizens throughout the whole of the territory and at the same price. However, the rules of profitability and the principle of competition run counter to these objectives and these functions. The citizens’ needs as regards high quality European public services are currently being expressed in many Union countries. The drawing-up of common European rules allowing harmonisation from the top downwards has become a necessity, particularly in view of enlargement. The modernisation of services of general interest must be part of a measure not seeking to open up the market to competition but intended to respond to the needs expressed. That requires genuine democratisation and the genuine participation of workers and users in the development of these services. In this connection, the European Union has a particular responsibility. It must, first of all, allow a proper evaluation to be carried out of the different liberalisation processes, country by country. Despite calls from the European Parliament on a number of occasions, this evaluation of the consequences for safety, the environment, quality and social concerns has never been carried out. Why? I too believe that we cannot wait for a Green Paper to be drawn up in a few months’ time to address this issue, however useful a Green Paper might be. Although a Green Paper might serve some purpose, I feel that services of general interest should no longer be seen as an exception to competition as they have been hitherto but, quite the opposite, that they must be seen as one of the European Union’s priority responsibilities. They must therefore no longer be subject to competition. Work is being carried out on a new Treaty within the framework of the work of the Convention with a view to the 2004 Intergovernmental Conference. We must address this issue in the debate on the Treaty. It is time to listen to the demands of the citizens, of the trade unions, which are demonstrating everywhere in a plea for high quality services. These demands go hand in hand with the need for a Europe of social progress, a more democratic Europe. That is why we cannot be content with a minimal definition of a European universal service. We must be ambitious for social Europe. We must place services of general interest at the centre of European integration and European citizenship.

 Mr President, I would also like to express my support for all those who have been affected by this terrible disaster. I think that we should praise the incredible efforts of the people of Galicia and Spain, as well as the voluntary workers who travelled from many different parts of Europe. Although we are able to welcome the proposals made by the Commission, the same does not apply to the decisions reached by the Council. I also regret, like other fellow Members, the fact that they are lacking in ambition. After the Erika
 disaster, and given the extent of the damage caused by the Prestige
, it is now urgent, Commissioner, to bring forward the date for applying the measures adopted. I am, however, also of the opinion that they are still inadequate. Prevention also means demonstrating to charterers, ship-owners, cargo owners, even classification societies, that their criminal and financial responsibility will be fully engaged if legislation is not observed and if a disaster occurs. Prevention also means taking the swift and courageous decision to ban flags of convenience in the territorial waters of the Union. This disaster once again highlights the harmful consequences of liberalisation of the maritime industry, which has led to rules on safety and social welfare being compromised. Europe should send a clear message to the maritime industry by proposing significant improvements to the social situation of sea-workers and by involving their organisations, as well as citizens’ associations, in drawing up and implementing specific and essential new measures to enhance safety at sea.

 Mr President, the – apparently essential – aim of the proposals for a regulation and directive put forward by the Commission is to strengthen the short-term competitiveness of pharmaceutical companies. It is proposed, in particular, to extend the length of time that clinical data is to be protected, to increase the flexibility of and accelerate the market authorisation procedure and, above all, to lift the ban on pharmaceutical companies advertising prescription-only medicines to the general public. What is essentially being proposed is the model used in the United States, where this ban was lifted in 1997. Based on an exclusively market-driven approach, these proposals consider medicinal products as an everyday, consumer article, almost a product like any other. This approach is combined with that which is increasingly common in international trade negotiations, which seek to subject health and education to the laws of the market within the framework of the liberalisation of services. In the light of this deteriorating situation, a group was set up at European level, bringing together consumer organisations, family organisations, patients’ associations, insurance companies, and health insurance bodies. The ‘Europe and Medicines’ group has been working to provide information and clarification to European bodies and governments. This action, which enabled us to get a better feel for the economic, political and ethical challenges of this dossier, has delivered results. Due to this, the majority of members of the Committee on the Environment approved the reports which are not in line with the Commission’s approach and I welcome, in particular, the fact that the reports are opposed to the advertising of medicinal products. My group, in conjunction with the ‘Europe and Medicines’ group, will pursue its efforts to have a responsible policy applied throughout the European Union, one which improves public health, therapeutic progress and consumer protection. In order to do this, three principles should be strengthened in the European medicines regulation system: harmonisation between countries in order to guarantee evaluation and monitoring of a high quality, the independence of institutions responsible for medicinal products, and the transparency of the system for all.

 Mr President, Commissioner, although the European Union has helped to improve health and safety legislation, it must be acknowledged that the situation is declining in some Member States and in some industries. The report by Stephen Hughes quite rightly emphasises three important points: the lack of resources, the absence of an action plan, the lack of balance between the legislative and non-legislative instruments. The report therefore calls for Community legislation to be simplified, for improvements in its implementation in the Member States and for issues relating to gender and corporate responsibility to be taken into account and for new instruments and specific measures addressing the situation in the candidate countries to be implemented. The report highlights the need for a detailed plan to be drawn up that has financial commitments and clear deadlines for each proposal and methods of monitoring its implementation. It also stresses and does so very firmly – this is something that I welcome – the need to integrate the gender dimension in the measures to be taken. Generally speaking, women receive the lowest salaries, have the least job security, and are at greatest risk of psychological or sexual harassment. Lastly, we must significantly improve the health and safety of women who are pregnant or breast-feeding or who have young children. I would also like to congratulate Stephen Hughes on this report, which I fully support.

 Mr President, Commissioner, on the basis of the information concerning the implementation of employment guidelines, the report by the Committee on Employment and Social Affairs proposes several improvements, emphasising job creation and training. In the extension of his report on the local dimension of employment adopted by Parliament in July, Mr Schmid rightly insists on the need to develop local and regional job markets. He makes a series of other proposals with which I agree, and I would like to join previous speakers in congratulating him. Having said that, I still want to emphasis that, although the European employment strategy has gradually transformed conditions for drafting and implementing national employment policies and enabled better coordination with economic policies, it has not, however, contributed to kick-starting growth or fundamentally changing the employment situation. So, is this a question of method or a matter of choice? The Heads of State and Government have opted for liberal choices by favouring the speeding-up of deregulation and liberalisation, wage moderation, and flexibility and insecurity in the labour market. I therefore believe that the chasm has deepened between the stated objectives on employment and social life within our committee here and the guidelines for the economic policies implemented in each EU Member State. Allow me to give a few pertinent examples. In France, restructuring is being speeded up, and redundancies and relocation are being imposed in several sectors. A substantial number of redundancies are due to take place in the new economy following the bursting of the IT bubble. Thousands of Vivendi group employees are anxious. They know that they will not have the same redundancy payments as their former employer, Jean-Marie Messier. Daewoo, which received bonuses and subsidies in Lorraine, is now moving to China. Total Fina Elf, which has made huge profits, is skimping on compensation to casualties of the AZF disaster in Toulouse and is considering a social plan involving 1500 employees of its subsidiary, Atofina. Alcatel has announced 23 000 job losses by the end of 2003. In the textiles sector, within Alstom and Avantis, businesses have closed or are starting to close. Under these conditions, I believe the problem we are facing is not so much juggling economy, employment and social considerations as the possible need to review the economy. Every day, experience shows us that there can be no true social and employment policy that responds to employees’ interests, the needs of the people, while economic policies remain tightly corseted by the stability pact and remain based on exacerbated competition and reduced labour costs. Yes, the subject of employment is at the heart of citizens’ concerns and we must do all we can to combat unemployment effectively and create jobs, which to my mind means we must put an end to the dominance of the financial markets. No real progress can be made, however, if the citizens themselves are not involved in decisions, if there is no effective social dialogue on the challenges of European construction, which are far more wide-reaching than the institutional aspects currently being addressed by the Convention.

 Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, once again, a woman, Mrs Amina Lawal, has been sentenced to death by stoning in one of the Muslim states of the Federation of Nigeria. Her crime is to have given birth to a child after her divorce. Some months ago, Safiya Husseini, sentenced to the same fate, was spared following an international outcry. But how many people have been sentenced to the same barbaric fate before this victory and how many will be sentenced in the future? It is high time that these highly antiquated legal decisions, which show complete contempt for human dignity, are prevented from being passed in Nigeria and elsewhere. This strict application of Sharia law, which has nothing to do with respect of the Muslim religion, was declared unconstitutional by the Nigerian Minister for Justice, including in the federal Muslim states of the north. In its constitution, the Federation of Nigeria describes itself as a secular State. Nigeria is also signatory to conventions which spell out its commitments at international level. Although the Katsina state is involved, there are other responsibilities: those of the federal Nigerian authorities which have a duty to ensure strict respect of the constitution and the protection of human rights for all Nigerian citizens, regardless of status, religion or sex. The international community, and Europe in particular, must condemn this unacceptable breach of fundamental human rights. Europe is opposed to the death penalty. It has committed itself to protect women’s rights against sexual discrimination and against religious intolerance. Doing everything in our power to save Amina Lawal from death by stoning is also one of Europe’s duties. Human rights organisations are bravely fighting in Nigeria. These organisations are often under threat, but they are working together despite the lack of resources and the lack of support, other than support from European organisations. We must support their demands. Lastly, as part of the Cotonou partnership agreements, Europe can and must urge Nigeria to respect its international commitments and to promote democracy and women’s rights.

 Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, the proposal for the creation of the Single European Sky is a complex issue, one that I, personally, still find rather ambiguous. I think, however, that Mr Fava and Mrs Sanders-ten Holte have done a considerable amount of work, given the size of this report. From the outset, in order to understand the full implications of this matter, I took the time to work with the industry. Only last Thursday, I spent the morning at the Roissy air traffic control centre and the afternoon at Athis-Mons, which is Europe’s third largest air traffic control centre after Maastricht and London. From this experience, I have come to believe that – in spite of the fact that the rapporteurs and the Commission have taken a number of points into account – what is being proposed today still presents serious dangers. I would like to thank the RET Committee for having incorporated a series of amendments that I had proposed so that more attention is paid to safety. I also feel it is very positive to include an amendment specifying that each Member State is free to appoint a public or private entity as its operator or operators, although I do believe that air navigation services represent a service of general interest and that competition rules cannot apply to them, as the European Court of Justice has in fact ruled. Unfortunately, even though these amendments were adopted, this has not, in my view, significantly changed the liberal undercurrents of the draft text. I shall try to explain what I mean. All the amendments proposed by my group, which clearly ruled out introducing competition in the air navigation sector, were rejected in committee. Even so, the House must still reflect on the fact that the air traffic control trade unions are united on this issue. Everyone in the industry – although there are, quite naturally, differences of opinion between the various parties – is coming to the same conclusion regarding the dangers of the current proposal. Yet, we are not talking about staff who are attached to so-called privileges and who are unable to accept change: the very job of an air-controller involves constant development and change. The current system is far from perfect. In addition, it is already cross-border in nature. Everyone is aware that cut-off points do not, generally, begin and end at borders. There are other reasons for this apart from air traffic control. The current system of course needs to be improved, but in my view, there are other problems, particularly that of the ultimate objective. The ultimate objective should, indeed, be the priority. There is also a problem regarding method. No reform of the air traffic control system will succeed without the help of air traffic controllers who are responsible for maintaining high safety standards in Europe. In addition, it was possible to bridge the gap – a very considerable gap between the extraordinary growth in air traffic in recent years and improving traffic flow – due to the increase in air traffic controllers’ productivity, not to mention the significant investment made to upgrade equipment. The search for standards that everyone in Europe can apply is an essential goal for the Union and, from this point of view, the European Commission can certainly play an extremely important role in providing harmonious organisation and effective control. Although the proposal for a regulation treats safety as a priority, I believe that all the proposals seeking to place the regulation on an economic basis run counter to this affirmation. Whatever forms, and they all differ considerably, are chosen by the Member States, the proposal to introduce competition in air navigation services by casting doubt upon the integrated system, including all the technical services, would be detrimental to navigation and it represents a tangible danger to safety. It is true that there is a link between safety, capacity and costs, but to purport to establish high safety standards by taking the economic question of cost as a priority and by referring to it above all else is, at best, illusory and, at worst, misleading as to the goal of maintaining high safety standards. Obviously, the flow of air traffic and its safety are dependent on a chain, all the links of which are essential. If the chain is broken, we risk seriously compromising safety. That is why, to put it frankly, if the texts do not make significant changes on these crucial issues, I will be unable to support them in their current form.

 Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, I think that the Commission communication reveals an impressive ambition. However, there is, unfortunately, a risk that this type of communication will remain a pious hope in terms of the form of globalisation that exists today and the consequences that it has. That is why, like all my fellow Members, I wholeheartedly support the report by Mrs Gillig, who deserves credit for highlighting a number of proposals that require clarification. Therefore, and I also stressed this point, Mrs Gillig raised the following question: what is the meaning of the freedom of expression or the freedom of association of workers in a dictatorship, or what does banning child labour mean in Less Developed Countries where there is no free and compulsory education system? Although the European Union has specific standards on child labour, trade union rights and equal treatment, it is still necessary to supervise the strict application of these standards and to establish processes ensuring their effectiveness. The report places the emphasis on improving relations between the European Union and the International Labour Organisation, but also on the need to respect the core standards declared by this organisation. It also puts forward some proposals with a view to making further progress. Lastly, the report emphasises the essential and positive role of trade unions working to promote core labour standards within the context of the World Trade Organisation, and also stresses the importance of the role of non-governmental organisations. Although I have taken careful note of these contributions, which I welcome, I would still like to stress the fact that the solution to the problem with which we are faced must not be restricted to alleviating or regulating the harmful effects of a neo-liberal form of globalisation. We see more evidence every day that this globalisation is making poor people even poorer and is widening the gap between north and south. This is not a question of fate or of an abstract situation. The European Union must, as a matter of urgency, state its ambition to give its support in combating this form of globalisation, and it must propose a genuine alternative measures for a new era in international relations. My group tabled amendments to this end. We therefore demand that the existence of unequal partners be taken into account, together with a reform of international financial institutions. We also demand that sanctions be principally aimed at transnational companies that fail to observe International Labour Organisation standards and especially if they profit from this violation at the expense of employees themselves. At the same time, and I shall conclude with this point, the European Social Forum, which is part of the global movement for a new form of globalisation, will be meeting in Florence in the near future. This very diverse movement will put together proposals with a view to reform, in particular, world trade rules and international financial institutions, in order to achieve a more supportive form of development. The Forum is calling for new international rights for employees of multinationals, particularly the right of association and collective negotiation. I think that this could be the opportunity for the European Union to listen to and support these proposals.

 Going beyond the proposals made by the Commission, the Lisi report undertakes a much more stringent revision of the Seveso II Directive. Some advances merit special emphasis: the introduction of lower threshold values for explosive substances, the inclusion of new carcinogens or of particular mining operations and the inclusion of the storage of certain substances in the catalogue of potential hazards. The report stresses the need to involve the staff of establishments and to enlist their practical and occupational experience and training in the effort to improve safety. The desire for transparency and public information and for the involvement of local populations in all safety plans is another very strong point of the report. However, in the preparation of safety plans, there is still a lack of real consideration of the establishments’ own health and safety committees. Where work is subcontracted, the report recommends that subcontractors’ staff should be involved and trained, but it does not question the rationale of subcontracting. The fact is, however, that the desire of directors to maximise their companies’ profitability, a desire that is reflected in their heavy reliance on subcontractors, runs counter to the quest for the highest possible level of safety. Nor does the report place enough emphasis on the responsibilities devolving on the boards of the establishments in question. Despite these reservations, I shall be voting in favour of this report for the reasons outlined above.

Mr President, thanks to action by the international community and previous resolutions adopted by Parliament on human rights in Nigeria, Mrs Safiya Hussaini, who was under sentence of death by stoning, has been pardoned. Even as we welcome this, we must remain vigilant. Other women are at risk of the same sentence of death by stoning, especially Mrs Lawal in the state of Katsina. The application of Sharia law affects women in particular, especially poorer women. These arbitrary judicial proceedings and the sentences passed on these women are contrary to the fundamental rights recognised under the international conventions ratified by Nigeria. We must denounce this selective judicial system which considers adultery a crime, which allows the men to walk free while the women are condemned, even if they are the victims of rape. Parliament must insist that the Nigerian Government prohibit any death sentence from being executed and institute proceedings before the constitutional court on the application of Sharia law. The Nigerian Government must abide by the international conventions on human rights which it has signed, as tangible proof of its intention to institute a process of democratisation and the rule of law, guarantee economic and social dialogue and foster dialogue between communities. We call on the Council, the Commission and the co-presidents of the ACP to use every political and commercial means at their disposal to ensure that the Nigerian Government applies and abides by these conventions and the African Charter on Human and People’s Rights.

Mr President, the special session of the UN General Assembly on Children will be an excellent opportunity to take stock of the progress made since 1989, when the declaration on the Convention on the Rights of the Child was made, and should bring the states face to face with their responsibilities in terms of abiding by their undertakings. In this sense, I am delighted that the resolution proposes creating mechanisms designed to control governments’ compliance with these undertakings in the future. I hope that this sitting will not be just another meeting. Children’s rights are flouted every day throughout the world, with access being denied to medical care and education, child soldiers, sexual exploitation, crimes against children, trafficking, child labour and malnutrition. Not to mention the particular type of discrimination to which little girls are prey in numerous countries; my fellow Member referred earlier to genital mutilation. Finally, children are the first to suffer in war situations and from poverty and social exclusion. Even in our own countries within the European Union, how many children fail to receive the care to which they are entitled or an environment in which they can flourish, quite simply because their parents are poor, socially excluded or immigrants with no papers? It is time the international community reiterated its undertaking to put the welfare of children throughout the world at the top of the agenda. Putting this undertaking into practice means spending money. I believe it also means promoting women's rights as the sine qua non 
to advancing children's rights. Europe has a very important part to play. It needs to develop partnerships between European institutions and associations, NGOs, governments and associations in candidate countries. We also need to involve children in certain decision-making processes at appropriate levels. Finally, I would add that we need to be much more coherent in our ambitions. Insisting that candidate countries, where children already face severe difficulties, reduce public spending, which includes health and education, seems to me to be incompatible with improving the rights of the child.

Mr President, the backdrop of the debate on the development of pensions systems is the new demographic context in Europe, a true challenge which has arisen due to the constant increase in the number of people reaching retiring age, which is linked to rising longevity. In this context, the Commission and the Council have often called for pensions system reform in the name of the Stability and Growth Pact and combating state deficits. Whilst national competence with regard to pensions is not called into question, the open method of coordination, an integrated approach serving national strategies aiming to ensure safe and sustainable pensions, is being proposed and this is the subject of Mr Fatuzzo’s report. We must find out the reason for this type of cooperation and how the objective of safe and sustainable pensions will be achieved. The issues of retirement age, guaranteed rights, the payment of pensions, in other words, retirement conditions, are all the more sensitive as they arise at the end of a lifetime of professional and human endeavours and are a guarantee of positive relations of mutual support between generations. It is good that Mr Fatuzzo’s report recognises that the debate on pensions must not be restricted to financing problems, but that rights must also be guaranteed. It is also good that he proposes to strengthen the open coordination method by democratic will, involving NGOs, the social partners, the candidate countries and the European Parliament in defining effective indicators and mechanisms with a view to assessing reforms and achieving modernisation. However, the report does support the Commission’s basic plan for a universal pensions system, although it waters them down by asking for collective systems of funded pensions to be promoted over individual financial pension and savings schemes. I do not know whether that will answer Mrs Van Lancker’s question, but the report basically supports the Commission’s desire to move towards more ad hoc
 reserve pension funds and not to use state spending within the framework of compliance with the Stability and Growth Pact. Nevertheless, we are all thinking about the Barcelona European Council which called for Member States to raise the retirement age by five years by 2010. Clearly, the question of financing arises. The development of the contributory system cannot be considered in the new demographic context without an increase in funds. That would be irresponsible. New resources must therefore be found. We believe that there should be greater focus in two areas: the development and creation of quality employment for new contributors, and alongside that, making financial income subject to social security contributions at the same rate as wages and salaries, as advocated by an amendment tabled by my group.

 Mr President, once again, the House is due to vote on human rights violations in Tunisia and today we are dealing with the conviction of three activists from the Communist Workers’ Party of Tunisia. After four years of living in hiding, the three activists decided to appear freely before the court in order to challenge their sentence in a court of law. The trial of 2 February, as other Members have said, was a sham. The defendants were seized from their seats, taken away by the police during the court proceedings, and swiftly condemned to harsh prison sentences – Hamma Hammami was sentenced to nine years and three months. These men were not given the chance to defend themselves and were not given access to their lawyers. All this happened before a number of Tunisian and foreign observers and protesters. They are being detained in a civilian prison in disgraceful conditions. This trial is a real parody of justice. In response to this situation, the Tunisian Lawyers Council declared a strike. Hamma Hammami and Abdel Jabarmadouri decided to go on hunger strike in protest at their conditions of detention and to demand that their lawyers be given the right of visit. These events are part of a continuing campaign of intimidation and repression, which targets political opponents, human rights protesters, journalists, trade unionists, students, lawyers and magistrates. We note that the EU-Tunisia Association Agreement, stipulating that relations between the two parties are based on the respect of democratic principles and human rights, has once again been flouted. We ask for an exceptional meeting of the EU-Tunisia Association Council to be organised as soon as possible to tackle the issue of human rights. Parliament must demand the release of Hamma Hammami and his co-defendants, and that Article 2 of the Agreement be respected. The Council and the Commission must use all the means provided for by the agreement in order to secure respect for democratic freedoms and human rights in Tunisia.

 Mr President, after the postal services market was opened up to competition – a process that began in 1997 – the Commission put forward new proposals in 2000 with the aim of achieving deregulation by 2003 and with a view to bringing about full liberalisation by 2009. I would reiterate that the Commission proposed, in particular, to reduce the weight and price limits, from 350g to 50g and from five to two and a half times the basic standard tariff, to establish special services with high added value which would be open to competition, the gradual liberalisation of outgoing cross-border mail and direct mail, and to set specific deadlines for full liberalisation. At first reading, a large majority of the European Parliament refused to fully support the Commission. Parliament proposed that reductions in the weight and price limits should not go below 150g and four times the basic standard tariff; it rejected liberalisation of cross-border mail and direct mail; it dismissed special services, put back the final deadline for liberalisation and lastly, requested a comprehensive impact study. The position of the Council of Ministers – regardless of what a number of Members are saying – differs considerably from the compromise reached by a majority in the European Parliament. Although the compromise also abandons the idea of creating special services – a move I welcome – it takes up the Commission’s original proposals on reducing the thresholds and, despite the fact that numbers evened out with the announcement of the deadline, I feel that the compromise will put full liberalisation of the sector at risk. It is therefore hard for me to understand why what we saw in a negative light yesterday is now something we regard positively. The Council and the Commission have not taken Parliament’s opinion into account. They are introducing a significant new stage into the liberalisation of the postal sector. Mr Ferber’s report – whose work I would also like to commend – as adopted by the Committee on Regional Policy, Transport and Tourism, falls in line with the Council’s position, although, admittedly, several amendments have been added, which I believe to be quite inadequate and which will certainly not require conciliation. As expressed in the minority opinion of Members of the Confederal Group of the European United Left – Nordic Green Left, the Group of the Greens/European Free Alliance and the Group for a Europe of Democracies and Diversities in the parliamentary committee, no guarantees have been given on social and economic consequences or on social cohesion. Contrary to the spirit and the text of the Langen report, no serious, transparent and pluralist preliminary study has been undertaken. Important issues such as conditions of access to networks of new operators or conditions for the financing of universal service remain ill defined. I must say that these proposals cause me, as they do my fellow Member, Mrs Flautre, a great deal of concern as to the effects they might have on working conditions, jobs and the quality of services provided with equal access for all, in other words, on the very future of public services. My group will therefore demand that the Council’s common position be rejected by a roll-call vote and, furthermore, will propose introducing a specific amendment for a study to be undertaken.

 Mr President, More Europe
, the theme of the Spanish Presidency, is an objective that we support in principle. The real question, however, is what Europe? At a time when the European Union is in need of strong economic and social growth and must meet the aspirations of its citizens who are making their voice heard, the Barcelona Summit is being heralded as a decisive step in achieving an accelerated liberalisation of public services that the President-in-Office of the Council earlier referred to as ‘a network industry’. Liberalisation provides the magic answer. We face growing expectations of more ambitious and high-quality public services, however. Can this just be national self-interest? I think that this need is universal. The sizeable disparities that exist between countries in terms of people’s access to these services justify drawing up common European standards that will allow harmonisation to be carried out from above. It is not fewer public services that should be on the agenda, but more public services, which have been improved through development, by being made more democratic and through modernisation. The Union still believes that public services, or services of general interest, are an exception to the rules of competition. They must instead become the heart of European social cohesion, the key to action for a progressive Europe, and become one of its reference points and one of its values. When presented with the progress report on cohesion in the Union, will we continue to destroy with one hand what we are trying to achieve with the other? The Barcelona Summit will not restrict itself to this issue, of course, but the fundamental problems are the same: the economic situation, the fight against terrorism, enlargement, the need for more democratic institutions; that is, so many issues which call for renewed consideration of the meaning of the European Union and its goals, with the first meeting of the Convention opening tomorrow. It is no longer sufficient to include the formal reference to 'a more social Europe', and to the fact that we need to be closer to the people. We need strong signs and practical action. The answers predicted to come out of the summit are not yet moving in the right direction – very much the opposite in fact. A more liberal Europe is unfolding behind the More Europe
 theme, and this is the credo of the market. The people have other expectations and they will express these expectations forcefully at the demonstrations that will take place on the eve of the Summit. It is crucial that we listen to them.

 Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, although Nice shed light on the need for a European social policy, there is still much to be done in order to guarantee a bold social policy which will improve the lives of our fellow citizens. The European Union should be a driving force promoting social guarantees. This does not run counter to society’s wishes: I refer to the second World Social Forum in Porto Alegre, which has once again put into perspective many of the social choices which are to be taken into account. It is up to us to respond to the expectations of the European citizens. However, any headway is progress, and I also welcome the comments in the report of the Committee on Employment and Social Affairs concerning the social policy agenda. I also welcome Mrs Hermange’s decision to include a number of fundamental comments in her report. I would like to emphasise three points from the recommendations made by the report. First, I am sorry that the Commission failed to take into consideration Parliament’s requests with regard to the right to strike at European level and the right to take collective action. These two rights seem to me to be essential to the correct working of the social relationship between employees, employers and politicians. These rights represent progress which could be classed as progress in civilisation and Europe should not be behind in this matter, as democracy is regularly at the heart of our concerns in this Assembly. Second, I would like to emphasise the report’s request that efforts to address the social dimension of enlargement be stepped up. This issue must also be at the heart of our concerns. Enlargement must succeed. It will not succeed if it is confined to a restricted vision of convergence criteria. Success would involve taking account of the needs of the people and the potential of each candidate country with a view to increasing everyone’s quality of life and of work. Third, I believe it is extremely important that all Commission decisions on concentrations and mergers take account of the social consequences and regional planning. The issue of the action to be taken and implementation is obviously crucial. Lastly, I agree with most of the comments expressed in Mrs Hermange’s report and my group will, of course, vote for this report.

 Mr Vice-President, I would also like to congratulate you on your election. Like my fellow Members, who have underlined that this was a report of titanic proportions, requiring a great deal of work, I would like to use my two minutes’ speaking time to try to put forward what I personally believe to be the essential points, bearing in mind those involved, particularly the local and regional authorities and the citizens. In my view, the Zappalà report, which was approved by the Committee on Legal Affairs, improves on the Commission’s original proposal for a directive. On the pretext of simplifying and updating the existing legislation, the Commission’s proposal does indeed propose to make the regulations uniform, but the main way, if not the only way, it achieves this is through liberalisation and this is something I cannot accept. Thus, when it comes to using prices as a criterion for awarding contracts, the lowest price is favoured over social and environmental criteria. I believe therefore, as do other Members, that the stakes are very high. Given their activity, public authorities should favour employment and sustainable development but decisions are instead based on financial criteria alone. However, in March 2000, the European Trade Union Confederation pointed out how much importance the Community regime for public contracts placed upon the concept of price, to the detriment of social and territorial cohesion, equality and employment. As I said, the Zappalà report improves on the Commission’s directive, particularly by raising the thresholds on opening up public procurement contracts by 50% and also by taking into greater consideration the social and environmental criteria. If adopted in its current form, I think it might represent an improvement on the current situation. Despite this, it is essentially the approach of liberalisation that is favoured. In a communication of 15 October 2001, the Commission was forced to put forward the option of integrating social and environmental aspects into procedures for the award of public contracts. However, this communication is not legally binding in character. We must therefore go further and approach it in a different way; this is the sense of the amendments tabled by my group. Within the award criteria, employment, the environment and town planning must be put on the same footing as economic cost. Of course, my group’s vote will depend on the outcome of the vote on the committee’s amendments and also on the amendments that will be proposed tomorrow.

 Mr President, I actually believe that, faced with the recession in the aviation industry and in air transport, we need some strong decisions in order to restore confidence and open up real prospects. I personally am not satisfied with the Commission’s response, which favours the speeding up of restructuring in the air transport sector. I am in favour of a European approach. We can discuss and comment on the content of that approach later. As for restoring confidence, I believe that confidence is actually a product of safety, and the safety dimension in this sector, as in others, is dependent upon the expertise, competence and qualifications of the staff employed. Commissioner, I am absolutely in agreement with you on the urgent need to develop the social dialogue, but we cannot just be content with a social dialogue at a time when people are facing the problem of redundancies. Is anyone really listening to the employees concerned? They too have comments, and thoughts, and proposals, and in view of what we have just decided regarding the consultation of workers, perhaps that could be implemented much more rapidly. I also believe that restoring confidence involves learning lessons from the present crisis and putting a stop to the process of liberalisation that is currently underway. Frankly, I do not believe that the liberalisation that has developed in this sector has contributed towards its development. In fact I would rather say that it has contributed towards its difficulties. Restoring confidence also means, at any given moment, taking responsibility for providing assistance. I believe that the limited targeted measures are insufficient to cope with this crisis. Since the American aid is considerable, I believe that there should be compensatory aid in the air transport sector, but that it should also be made conditional upon maintaining jobs. Finally, I believe that we also need to open up prospects. It seems to me that among our long-term prospects we should be looking at how the European Union can work, not towards concentrations, but towards the development of international cooperation, on safety and the management of air traffic, between the airlines and the public authorities. Mr President, I believe that we should also increase cooperation between air and rail transport, and that airports should be integrated into the trans-European networks.

 Mr President, faced with the process of liberalisation and deregulation currently underway in the European Union, moves for proposals to be put forward and action to be taken in the field of public services have built up. The contribution of these has led to the fact that Article 16 of the Treaty of Amsterdam recognises the essential role of services of general interest in ensuring social and territorial cohesion. The Commission’s proposals, however, contain the usual double language. On the one hand, there is reference to the interests of citizens, and therefore to the need for services of general interest, whilst on the other, several of the Commission’s directives accentuate liberalisation and deregulation of public services. The Langen report supports the spirit of the Commission’s communication of September 2000 on services of general interest in Europe. The Commission acknowledges that competition cannot meet all the requirements of citizens and that Member States have good reason to set up and implement services of general interest. At the same time, however, the Commission states that the progress of liberalisation is positive and relies on the content of the Lisbon meeting of the Council of Ministers to step up this process. The report has been improved by the debate and the amendments. It has made a real effort to adopt a balanced position between liberalisation and public services, it also stresses that services of general interest must ensure equal access, security of supply and continuity. It also proposes to assess the actual impact of liberalisation before embarking on any new phases, as my group suggested on many occasions. However, we still have a long way to go before we meet the required demands for services of general interest that are worthy of the name. The Langen report claims to relentlessly pursue liberalisation in sectors such as transport, electricity and gas and the postal services. Furthermore, it believes that it is necessary to privatise the water industry. I think that services of general interest, as their name suggests, must be subject to the rights and obligations that the general interest demands. In other words, this means providing transparency, continuity and equality. We need a new European model of services of general interest that meets citizens’ aspirations, and we must stop approaching this issue solely from the point of view of competition, as advocated in the report. That is why I do not think it is wise, and I think it could even be dangerous, to envisage a framework directive where we stick to this approach. Yes, I believe that we need safeguards. I am in favour of a framework directive on services of general interest on the condition that it maintains the social benefits that these provide in terms of employment, security and sustainable regional development. This directive should also ensure the respect of service obligations in terms of quality, equality, access for all users, and also by maintaining reserved areas allowing price offsetting on a geographical basis and on social grounds. I also think that all levels of the European Union must be involved. Our position will be related to whether or not a number of amendments are accepted.

Mr President, the aim of the directive proposed by the Commission is indeed to open up all port services to competition. In my opinion, these proposals will address the living and working conditions of port staff but I do not feel that they will improve them. We are told that improvements are taking place, but, as is all too often the case, there has been no prior study of the effects of this liberalisation, in particular with regard to such important issues as safety, the environment and employment. Those affected have not been consulted, in particular, trade unions (we can always call them ‘lobbies’ if you prefer), even though they know the safety needs of people and the environment, and have unrivalled knowledge. Although the amendments made to Mr Jarzembowski’s report take into consideration certain problems that I have just raised, in my opinion they are far from adequate. They do nothing to temper the line taken by the text as a whole. Self-handling in the ports would therefore equate to allowing social dumping. Given the current practices of commercial fleets, this measure will lead to inadequate safety levels and the deterioration of environmental safety, employment and working conditions. I will support the amendments that seek to exclude dockers from the directive. These staff carry out an important economic task under difficult conditions, while still ensuring safety. Nautical services for piloting and mooring are universally recognised as services of general interest. They should, in my opinion, be considered as partners in their own right, with a view to sustainable development. Well then, the proposals of the Committee on Regional Policy, Transport and Tourism, do take account of pilots but not of mooring service providers, which I personally regret. I believe that the European Union should work towards harmonisation at the top end of working and employment conditions for employees in this sector, which is the only way to genuinely guarantee economic and social effectiveness while respecting the environment. The proposals made to date will not, in my opinion, take us any further towards these essential objectives.

 Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, in 1999 we had the Mont Blanc tunnel disaster. Yesterday, we had another tragedy, in the St Gotthard tunnel. This chapter of disasters is certainly not coincidental, it is the human price we pay for basing our goods transport system on HGV transport and pursuing the maximum profit, which creates terrible risks. Since the Mont Blanc tunnel was closed, the Maurienne valley has had to absorb the weight of all the traffic and is suffocating as a result. The St Gotthard tragedy will lead to even more re-routed traffic for the valley to absorb. Even in normal times there are not enough crossing points. So we need to tackle the problem of transit transport. We have to look for global solutions. In this context, reopening the Mont Blanc tunnel would mean ensuring that the correct distances between vehicles are observed, that road traffic is regulated, that partial traffic bans are observed, that ceilings on lorry numbers are imposed and observed, that the limits laid down for lorry-drivers' working hours are observed and that safety rules are continuously monitored. Finally, it would mean undertaking to develop 'piggybacking' and making immediate use of the existing transverse lines, which are under-used. We urgently need to review the entire policy of goods transport in Europe. The Union must finance adequate investment to that end. I think that in sensitive areas we should give up road goods transport, which means that, as of now, we have to mobilise the necessary resources for speeding up the development of piggybacking. The European Union must now show the political courage to make new and bold choices. Thank you.

 Mr President, Commissioner, Mrs Ghilardotti’s report on the directive on information and consultation of workers is very topical indeed. Many Member States of the European Union have, unfortunately, been faced with a wave of mergers, restructurings and numerous redundancies, such as at Danone, Marks and Spencer and Moulinex, to name but a few. Until now, the directive has not enabled employees to take any effective action and to have a real bearing on their future, and that of the business. In many other cases, the directive has not been applied. That is why I support the proposals made in the report by Mrs Ghilardotti, because the directive strengthens provisions and provides the means to apply these provisions. The Council included Parliament’s amendments in its common position; the reference to the most favourable provisions for employees, the obligation to respect minimum requirements, and the non-regression clause. Although this is a step forward, we must go further, as proposed in Mrs Ghilardotti’s report. Some important amendments have again been proposed, which improve the report. For example, employees shall be consulted and informed at the planning stage, before decisions are taken. For example, if the decision has an adverse effect on employees, such as collective redundancies or closure, the final decision must be postponed so that consultations can continue with a view to avoiding or mitigating the consequences. This directive will enable us to begin to encourage an approach to economic and social issues, which includes improving working conditions and economic efficiency. This efficiency requires the involvement of employees, naturally. That is why we are proposing two amendments, which rule out the possibility of withholding information where there is a risk or prejudice to the business. To demand discretion is one thing. To enable the company’s management, once again, to take unilateral decisions on the nature of the information is quite another. Obviously, we must be determined to ensure this directive is observed, and I hope that, this time, the Council will heed Parliament’s will.

 Madam President, Commissioner, the question regarding the safety of Europe’s skies is being considered in terms of immediate and urgent measures. It is also being considered in terms of longer-term measures regarding security standards in aircraft and at boarding. We have duly noted the Commission statements, particularly on the various measures taken regarding checks on passengers, on hand luggage, as well as on flights from third countries. In my view, these are wise comments. We must also accelerate the completion of security programmes relating to checks on hold luggage and ensure that our decisions have been implemented. I shall not go back over what was said earlier regarding the scandalous situation involving the AZF factory, only a few weeks after we held debates in this Chamber. As far as safety on aircraft and at boarding are concerned, the events of 11 September show that two measures must be taken in aircraft design: cockpits must be sealed off and video monitors must be installed to enable the pilot to see anyone nearing the cockpit. Secondly, there is the issue of transponders. Transponders transmit the aircraft’s code and position to the air traffic control tower. Transponders must be secure and it must no longer be possible to disconnect them during flights, as was the case during the attacks on the United States. I would also like to draw Parliament’s attention to the issue of aid to the European airline industry. To be honest, I think that it is extremely tactless, even provocative, for the Commission to open the debate on concentration within the airline industry at this point in time. In addition to the economic battering that companies are taking, to confirm that Europe only has enough room for four or five airlines amounts to inviting mergers, restructuring and therefore redundancy plans. On the other hand, several sources are predicting a 15 to 30% decrease in air traffic and the European Association of Air Carriers states that overall traffic levels will have decreased by more than 7% by 2002, incurring losses estimated to be over three billion euro. In my view, the regulations on state aid to airlines must be extended in order to take into full consideration all the consequences of 11 September. Lastly, I would like to say one final word to point out that these public funds are intended to help companies to continue to be viable. I believe, therefore, that it is our duty to ensure that they are used and to avoid any redundancies in the sector.

Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, poverty in the world is a violation of human rights and an intolerable breach of human dignity. It affects hundreds of thousands of men, women and children. This poverty has increased in the last six years. In the European Union there are 65 million people living on less than 60% of the national average income, to say nothing of the differences within the Member States. It is thanks to social transfers and social assistance systems that the poverty level has remained at 18% in the Union. But with the slowdown in economic growth, we are in danger of exclusion and poverty being aggravated again. An analysis of the proposals from the associations and the work of the Intergroup on the European fourth world clearly indicate that the fight against poverty and exclusion should become a vital element of sustainable development. The objectives set should be pursued and integrated into all policies, with more resources. I regret that the financial provision for anti-poverty programmes is still inadequate. The Laeken European Council should adopt political measures on income, employment, housing, health, education, training and culture. Parliament should also have objectives guaranteeing the right to quality housing for all, against the constant withdrawal of employment and services and re-establishing citizenship and equal rights. This is also why, on the occasion of the World Day against poverty, which will take place on 17 October, the European Parliament, in cooperation with the associations concerned, should also promote initiatives to raise awareness and to mobilise people to eliminate poverty and destitution. I hope that this day will enable us to make a further commitment to implementing programmes against poverty, by developing economic and social policies that really deal with the underlying causes of that poverty.

 Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, like other Members from the region, I was in Toulouse at the time of the explosion. Since then, I have met with several employees, residents and friends who have been affected by this disaster. I wish to point out that when we talk about suffering, trauma and shock, we are talking about men and women whose lives have been deeply wounded and their anger is in proportion to this shock. I wish to pay tribute to the memory of the victims and also to the local authority workers, the emergency and medical teams, the Electricité de France
 employees and all the men and women who, with their skills and goodwill, gave their energies to serve the general interest. It is also at times like this that we rediscover the importance of public services and their staff as a tool for serving the general interest. Many political leaders have spoken of the absurdity of locating this type of chemical plant near to large urban centres. It is worth making the point that wherever this type of industry is located, there are men and women working. In a far-off desert or in the centre of Brussels, if the factory blows up, scores of workers will lose their lives. The first question we should address is that of making these industries as safe as possible. Admittedly, the debate on the location of sites has been opened, but this aspect cannot be considered unless there are major improvements in inspection and safety conditions. The entire situation has changed. It is my view that the Seveso directives need to be reviewed. Let us use what we learn from this disaster to improve regulations on safety and on respecting the environment. We must come up with new, much more restrictive regulations on the way these plants are run and, above all, on the resources available to inspection bodies. By way of anecdote, a terrifying one, the inspection body responsible for the Midi-Pyrénées
 region has 17 inspectors to inspect over 2000 companies. Amongst the first factors thrown up by the investigation, I know that the investigation is not over, but nevertheless, there are many indications that the company’s management took a rather irresponsible approach to risk management. We must draw the obvious conclusions from that. Following the disaster, we are discovering serious safety lapses in the chemical industry in other parts of the country. This review process must be undertaken in tandem with a mission whose work is open to the whole of Europe and which has the task of carrying out an assessment of European safety. Inspection bodies must publish their results. The investigation in Toulouse must be transparent and must involve employees and local residents. I therefore call on Parliament to state its support for an exceptional risk assessment procedure in Europe and to review the directives. Toulouse is today a city in shock, in terms of the physical environment, psychologically and in terms of the direct and indirect consequences for employment and for businesses located near the site. Toulouse needs financial and logistical aid. The Union must demonstrate its capacity for solidarity at times of crisis. Will this require exceptional emergency funds? I am not sure, but the European Commission could, for example, contact the city, the département
 and the region to sound out their logistical needs. In this situation, the mobilisation of European engineers and support teams could, in symbolic terms as well as being effective, demonstrate the commitment of the European Union. ‘Never again!’ ‘Never again!’ is what tens of thousands of Toulouse’s citizens are shouting and calling for. ‘Never again!’ was what the communities affected by the oil slick from the Erika
 shipwreck, demanded. Once again, the approach of profit, job cuts and investment has led to a lapse in safety and has caused an ecological and human disaster. In order to confront this, we need further public regulation, more rules on inspection and more resources. We know that people are initially angry with the company’s bosses, but they will turn on us next and this fury will be unleashed on us, the political leaders. And they would be right to do so. Our task is to produce rules that benefit the community, not to bow down to the dominance of private interests.

 Mr President, as thousands of employees in Europe are faced with a wave of restructurings, redundancies and redundancy programmes, the Menrad report on European works councils, although it will not radically change the situation, will at least provide a new source of support for employees to enable them to cope with extremely difficult situations and to have some bearing on the decisions being taken. At a time when growth is giving us cause for concern, we should give thought to the content of this growth and the necessity to develop it, by encouraging job stability and skills. There is an urgent need for genuine consultation with employees, an urgent need to dispense with the attitude of treating men and women as goods which are no longer useful, because shareholders consider that they are not profitable enough, even in spite of the true economic situation. Mr Menrad’s report is the fruit of considerable labour, and I would also like to acknowledge his efforts. The report is also the result of the willingness of the Committee on Employment and Social Affairs to listen to representatives of the employees of large European companies. Using these meetings as a basis, the Menrad report was able to make a reliable assessment of the situation by showing the need for considerable amendments to the content of the directive. I support many of the proposals made in the report. I would like to reiterate some of them which in my view represent major steps forward for employees. For example, the call, set out in the second paragraph, for information and consultation to take place at regular intervals before the decision by the company or group, so as to allow the workers genuinely to influence the management’s decision-making process. Furthermore, in particularly serious cases, this information could even extend to giving the employees’ representatives the possibility of gaining a negotiating period before a decision takes effect, as described in item 14. I shall again quote the second item, which contains a clause that the decisions of the management will only be regarded as legitimate if an orderly information and consultation process as defined in the Directive has taken place beforehand, or item 13, which proposes the introduction of sanctions for non-compliance. Lastly, there is also the call for companies to repay funds and financial aid provided if they do not observe the law in this area, and to exclude them from public procurement. These proposals are a step in the right direction, but I believe that to ensure action for employment is effective and to improve economic performance in Europe, we could have gone further with regard to the right of employees to participate in the future of companies. This is the goal of the amendment that my group tabled, which calls for the possibility of employees’ representatives to have the right to a suspensive veto. This would involve giving a guarantee to employees’ representatives that their alternative proposals would at least be examined and taken into account. Many decisions which have spelled disaster for companies and for employment could have been avoided if employees had been able to influence these decisions. This right, which is an expression of social justice and democracy within a company, also guarantees efficiency for the economy and society. Once again, the Menrad report represents a considerable step forward and this is why it has the support of my group.

Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, although a number of questions remain open, let me say from the outset that I endorse the three reports before us on the ‘Erika II’ package, while at the same time emphasising that we urgently need to adopt them and, even more, to implement them. Improvements are still needed and, I hope, are still possible; that is the purpose of the amendments my group has tabled. I will confine my comments to two points I regard as crucial. The first is the need for greater democracy, to enable the various players involved in this sector to have a say in the decision-making process. Secondly, we must go further on the question of compensation. Coming back to the first point, priority must be attached to giving the men and women involved a say. That is a democratic requirement to which the European Union constantly refers as one of its values; but it is also a question of effectiveness. If we want to improve safety at sea we must also mobilise all the citizens concerned, in particular nature conservation associations, trade union organisations and, more generally, the personnel involved in maritime traffic. With regard to compensation, we very much need this initiative. We have to listen to the victims, the elected representatives, the local associations involved. We must give them a say in the actual evaluation of the consequences of the damage as also in the decisions on compensation. They have a role to play in the management of the COPE Fund. The same requirement should apply to the Safety Agency, which should be open to representatives of the employees of this industry, to representatives of the associations, who have the kind of know-how that is crucial to any proper evaluation. In even broader terms, I believe that the agency should ensure that they are involved in its initiatives on a regular basis. On the second point, it is unacceptable that in the final analysis much of the damage caused by maritime disasters is borne by the people who are the victims. That is the reason for establishing the COPE Fund and that is why we are supporting this initiative. Let me say once again that I think it would be very judicious to hold the ship owners and charterers liable both financially and under criminal law. We must also establish the link between the nationality of the ship owner and the flag flown by the ship. Lastly, according to some estimates, the COPE compensation ceiling of EUR 1 billion will suffice for the Erika 
disaster. I believe that to accept that ceiling would mean accepting that we do not pay full compensation for other disasters, which, alas, we cannot exclude at this point, and therefore that the countries concerned have to bear much of the costs. We would have preferred no ceiling to be set, so that the compensation corresponded as closely as possible to the real need; in the meantime, I believe we should consider raising that ceiling.

 Mr President, the Commission’s recommendations to the Member States are loaded with all the usual European Union dogmas, with the emphasis on reducing national debt. This basically equates to cuts in public and social spending. Mr von Wogau’s report takes the same approach. There is a self-satisfied air about this that I find quite disconcerting, given the worsening economic situation, and a refusal to consider the conditions needed to promote sustainable development. The declared ambition is to follow a programme of stability. The European Central Bank’s primary goal is to ensure price stability. The European Central Bank still refuses to lower interest rates, because it is obsessed with the threat of inflation, which is still on the horizon, and the President of the Bundesbank recently reminded us that the European Central Bank is not responsible for either growth or employment. The report reiterates the European Union’s goal to be more competitive and more dynamic, which is a worthy objective, but the proposals on the resources needed to implement this remain within the realms of dogma. These include adjusting pension systems to take account of budgetary restrictions, fully exploiting the potential for spending cuts in all areas, although the euphemism given to the public is ‘creating an appropriate environment to foster investment in terms of the labour market’, without forgetting, of course – and this is the perpetual icing on the cake – liberalisation in the outstanding sectors. There is no mention of our obligations towards Community level services of general interest. Basically, we are continuing to use the same old strategies, namely the anti-inflationist credo, the number one priority. We all know the consequences of this approach. The report shows no hesitation in stressing the progress made in reducing levels of unemployment in some Member States, and highlights the need to continue reform of the labour market. It would be worthwhile assessing the nature of these newly created jobs, which are most often insecure. How can you possibly strive for improvements in unemployment whilst totally disregarding the strategy of the large and generally profitable European companies, which keep a close eye on financial criteria and make many of their employees redundant on the pretext of maintaining competitiveness? Although this stretches the credibility of the European social model, we are coming up against obvious reluctance to take the necessary measures to protect employees. There is no mention of the social policy that is essential to consolidating growth. No mention of businesses’ social responsibilities. Once again, this sort of economic policy does not tally with the desire to achieve sustainable development, which would require a dynamic of public investment and organising a market with strong industrial ambitions. The necessary capital does exist. There is an urgent need to control the reality of the financial market and that is why my group, in the process of discussing this report, is revisiting the European Union’s economic policies and proposes to introduce a tax on speculative buying in order to control them, to reduce their volatility and most importantly to raise resources to invest in society and the environment. This report, and the situation of the European Union in general, show once again that it would be beneficial to make the EU’s political, economic and social decisions part of a genuine democratic process, which could be established in each country, after wide-ranging consultation with civil society in Europe.

 Mr President, in the light of the unilateral decision made by the United States, I would like to remind you of the conclusions of the intergovernmental group of experts on climate change, which said that if nothing is done to put a brake on the current trend, temperatures may increase by between 1.4 and 5.8 degrees by 2100, which will have disastrous consequences for the planet. Sea levels will rise; there will be more severe droughts and more brutal floods; islands, coastal regions and deltas will disappear; we will see famines and epidemics and entire species will become extinct. The poorest populations will be most affected. And this is not necessarily the worst-case scenario. That is why Parliament must take a stand on this issue and express, in the strongest terms, its deep indignation at the decision taken by President Bush to reject the Kyoto Protocol. At a time when populations are quite rightly apprehensive about the prospect of climate change, the consequences of which would be disastrous, the United States, the major consumer of energy in the world, has taken a decision which is totally irresponsible and dangerous. Furthermore, I think that all honourable Members are aware of the fact that the United States has even gone so far as to authorise an oil company to drill for oil in an Alaskan nature reserve. This attitude of allegiance to the interests of multinational companies shows total contempt for both humans and nature. All nations must assume their responsibilities. I welcome the protests made by the European Union, other major countries and Member States. The United States, which signed the Kyoto Protocol in 1998, must be called to account. We must reject any re-examination of the Kyoto commitments. We must ratify and apply the protocol even without the United States. Commissioner, as we know from past experience that a verbal protest will not be enough, in order to apply effective pressure it would be judicious to include environmental clauses in international commercial negotiations. It is the future of the planet and of our children that is at stake. I do not think it is employment which acts against the environment. Once again, it is the primacy of money that militates against humane and sustainable development, which is the undeniable ambition espoused by the European Union.

 Mr President, the report by our fellow Member, Marie-Thérèse Hermange, gives some very positive support to the awareness campaign proposed by the Commission for the year 2003, which has been declared the European Year of Disabled Citizens. We need to change our way of thinking, but I believe that it is crucial to propose a series of measures, as Mrs Hermange has, in favour of a genuine policy of non-discrimination. To be recognised as being different, but having the right to be fairly treated is the philosophy that runs through all the proposals, particularly those relating to easy access to the work place and to public spaces, the exportability of disability benefits for workers and dependent persons within the EU or the mutual recognition of national cards carried by people with disabilities. The report also stresses the need for a sense of responsibility with regard to equal treatment in the labour market, vocational training and education. Professional integration is therefore associated with social integration. In this respect, the report shows that the value of the work performed by a person with a disability cannot be measured solely in terms of competitiveness. I believe that these are ambitious guidelines that give a true reflection of the overall thinking of the parliamentary committee concerned and the determination of the organisations representing people with disabilities. I would add that the proposal to monitor and evaluate the measures adopted seems to be a very positive step, as does the transition from a simple intergovernmental policy to a Community policy in this area. I can only see two shortcomings. On the one hand, the report adopts, in my view, an extremely hesitant attitude towards businesses with regard to the employment of people with disabilities, and the proposal regarding the income of people with disabilities who are in employment is much too weak – and I quote ‘an income at least equal to the level of benefits received by people who are not in employment’. On the other hand, the ambiguous nature of the part of paragraph 20 which relates to research into therapies at the beginning of life must, in my opinion, be withdrawn, which justifies the amendment tabled by my group. Incidentally, this report was much needed and I believe, as do my colleagues, that it is also extremely good.

 Mr President, the biotechnology industry in fact provides us with an important means of combating certain diseases, reducing the use of chemical products in agriculture and of protecting the environment. Mr Purvis quite rightly emphasises all these developments. However, by almost exclusively falling into line with the approach of biotechnology companies, and by giving priority to economic and technological aspects, the report pays minimal attention to the major questions of ethics and safety, which are giving the general public so much concern. There is a risk that the biotechnology industry, seen from a strictly industrial and mercantile point of view, will make all these problems worse; for example, unfair trade, environmental disasters, industrial mergers and unemployment and the increasing power of multinationals. I do, therefore, find the report is too partial by far and is even prejudiced. It disregards the concerns that were even expressed in this House on GMOs. It questions the moratorium imposed by several Member States, one of which was France. I agree with what my fellow Member has just said. I think that, given all the problems we face – and since I heard you mention courage earlier – it would show courage to persevere with the precautionary principle and take time to verify the facts of the situation. While I do, therefore, acknowledge the advantages of biotechnologies, I cannot support the report as it stands. I hope that it will be amended, particularly in the light of the conclusions of the Sjöstedt report, which is, in the main, based on respect for the precautionary principle. In its Sixth Framework Research Programme, the Commission made biotechnology and genetic engineering priority areas. It is preparing a strategic communication on biotechnology to be completed by the end of 2001. I call on the Commission to do all it can to take full advantage of the contribution that biotechnology can make to economic growth and to the protection of the environment, but also to take full account of ethical, environmental and social issues, which I believe require dialogue between politicians, scientists and citizens.

 Mr President, faced with massive mergers and industrial restructuring resulting in thousands of redundancies, many employees, many European citizens, have found Europe to be powerless if not actually colluding with these actions, in line with the law of free competition. It is high time that we provided means to intervene on behalf of employees. There is an intolerable contradiction between the Council and the Commission’s declared priority of promoting employment and the massive redundancies that big businesses are making, and who are, at the same time, making fantastic profits. Michelin, Moulinex, Danone and Alstom are not businesses experiencing difficulties. They are perfectly competitive, and have a record of making more than adequate profits, but they are laying off thousands of people nonetheless. The case of Danone is very instructive, making 3 000 people redundant in Europe and 1 700 in France. In the year 2000, this firm’s European installations made a net profit of EUR 795 million, or 17% more than in 1999. It is not possible to sit back and simply watch the unfolding spectacle of mergers that make men and women redundant, plunging entire families into chaos. The European citizenship we so often refer to in this society will continue to be nothing more than just so much hot air as long as employees are not properly informed and consulted on choices which determine their own future and that of their region and their country. How, furthermore, can we find it acceptable for groups to benefit from grants of public financial aid to promote employment without being obliged to comply with the commitments they have made? In such instances, the aid funds should be paid back to the community which will have to bear the social costs resulting from the choice of financial profitability over employment. I do not think that the problem boils down to employability or adaptability or to simply dealing with the social fallout, as the Commissioner suggested. I therefore endorsed the proposals made in the resolution as well as the amendments that clarify and strengthen certain aspects. We shall have to go much further to respond to the democratic demands of the working citizens of Europe. I therefore feel that rights should be developed to the point where it is possible to halt scheduled redundancies and ongoing mergers. Any merger contract must include social clauses. Penalties must also be introduced for failure to comply with the directives on worker consultation. At this time when there is a great deal of debate on the subject of European identity and the direction that European integration should be taking, I feel that a text specifying certain employee rights in the face of financial objectives would be the least that could be done so as to give the European Union a degree of credibility. I shall therefore vote in favour of the resolution which I hope will be enhanced by a number of amendments.

 Mr President, I would also like to join Members in recognising the considerable work that has been carried out by the rapporteur and the Committee on Regional Policy, Transport and Tourism, who have incorporated many amendments. I would, however, like to come back to some points I think worth emphasising to make the report as effective as possible. First of all, I feel it is imperative to point out that the main thing is to promote the sustainability of transport, which is a fundamental, long-term measure needed to protect our environment and avoid congestion. On this issue, I do not believe that it is possible to consider freight transport on the same level as private transport. The former is currently widely favoured as an economic activity, whereas the latter allows freedom of movement, a fundamental freedom. We must extend the quality choice range in the variety of transport available. That should then drive us to consider the need to improve services of general interest in these sectors that are so important to the people and to the economy. Secondly, I also believe that we need to pinpoint priority issues. We cannot consider rail users and road users on the same level either. This means that the cost of road use is added to the total of costs borne by society such as environmental costs and the costs of accidents. All studies have clearly shown this. We must give this factor priority in terms of Community action. To sum up, with regard to changes in charging, I believe that this type of charging should not further increase costs, particularly those paid by users. Any infrastructure charging system, like the one proposed in my group’s amendment, should improve the services of general interest, which some transport services provide, in order to offer all citizens equal access to high-quality, safe and affordable services.

 Madam President, I should like to make three remarks. Firstly, the Commission’s new postal directive envisaged, in fact, the almost total liberalisation of postal services. By putting operators in competition with each other in the most profitable areas, it would lead to the closure of a large number of post offices, job losses and insecure jobs and would result in social dumping. We are given two reasons for the need for further liberalisation. Firstly, to continue the process of creating a large, liberalised European market while stating that liberalisation of this kind would create jobs. However, no one is deceived into believing that the Commission’s proposals are not part of an initiative to abolish the universal service. Secondly, reference is made to the 1997 Directive. However, if liberalisation had been such a great success, then why, in spite of the repeated requests by Parliament, has the Commission still not carried out a public critical assessment of the consequences of the first phase of the liberalisation of the sector in 1997, not only in terms of employment, but also in terms of postal rates and the number of post offices remaining throughout Europe? My second remark is this: as soon as it was known about, the planned new directive elicited a great many reactions. The fact is, across the range of very different approaches, the proposals made have been deemed inadmissible by a majority of players in the postal services field and also by a great many parliamentarians. Trade unionists, consumer associations and postal workers have expressed their views right here in Strasbourg. A European appeal has been launched by the MEPs in three of our parliamentary groups. What has been gauged is the considerable importance people attach to their local post offices. What lies behind this concept is what it represents as an integral component in social cohesion and harmonious urban and rural planning. Social cohesion is a frequently recurring theme here in Parliament. Like a good many others, it is a term requiring some practical expression. I believe, moreover, that it is this which has made it possible to curb the most retrograde provisions of the directive proposed by Commissioner Bolkestein. Indeed, the notion of special services is eliminated by the amendments of the Committee on Regional Policy, Transport and Tourism and by taking account of the opinions of the Committee on Industry, External Trade, Research and Energy and the Committee on Employment and Social Affairs. I am very pleased about that, because this notion of special services was in any case intended to exclude new technologies from the scope of universal service. The 50-gramme weight limit proposed for the reserved sector has been increased to 150 grammes, the rates have been increased from two and a half times to four times the standard tariff and the dates from which the new directive is to apply, like the date for transposition, have been put back. I also think it important that there is no longer any reference to a new time limit for liberalisation and that there is, in addition, a formal requirement for a genuine assessment. Finally, my third and last remark: although these initiatives are worth emphasising and represent serious resistance to the initial project, we ought not to deceive ourselves that we are not embarking upon a new phase in the liberalisation of the postal sector. That is something about which I, unlike other colleagues, was not happy. We therefore need to remain vigilant. We need to ensure that there are no harmful consequences for employment and for the post office network, or for postal rates, because we are told it is to be beneficial. However, Parliament also needs to work on determining what is required of a high quality universal service relevant to the demands of the new century within the European Union. Social and economic development is leading to an explosion in the need for information. Enabling everyone to access the various means by which information is transmitted is crucial to the economy and to society. It is not, however, possible to enable everyone to access these modes of transmission in the framework of unfettered competition. The modern economy, which was so dear to those at the Lisbon Summit, needs a modern universal service developing along lines quite different to those of the dogma of liberalisation. The fact that restraints have been placed on the initial project and yet, at the same time, the fact that a new phase of liberalisation is being embarked upon will lead me to abstain from voting on Mr Ferber’s report.

Mr President, Commissioner, Mr President-in-Office of the Council, the disasters of the past few months have brought to light the inadequacies of legislation, weaknesses in the systems of control and deficiencies in terms of human and financial resources. Initiated by the French Government and driven forward within the European Council of Transport Ministers, the proposed European directives are an undeniable step forward. They are supported by the parliamentary reports we are debating this morning. The Watts report intensifies the measures against ships posing serious risks or flying flags of convenience without abolishing them altogether. The Larrea report on classification societies harmonises legislation, develops sanctions that go as far as the withdrawal of authorisation, and increases compensation in the event of accident. The Hatzidakis report, whilst banning single-hull oil tankers on the same dates as the American bans, nevertheless introduces a whole raft of exemptions which do not go in the desired direction, notably with the proposal to extend the deadlines for the phasing-out of single-hull vessels. My group supports the Watts and Larrea reports. We will vote in favour of them. The vote on the Hatzidakis report will be linked to the vote on the rapporteur’s amendments. The two directives and the regulation we are examining are an asset in confronting the enormous challenge of maritime safety and need to be implemented as quickly as possible. They are nevertheless inadequate in view of the magnitude of the problems that are posed. Many players have stressed that the lack of maritime safety is largely due to deregulation and lenient practices. In the context of increased competition, the primary objective is to transport goods as quickly as possible, at the lowest cost, at the expense of safety, the environment and the crews. In measurable terms, the liberal rationale is effectively opposed to a high level of maritime safety. I reiterate that current European decisions, whilst being a definite asset, do not question this rationale. Hence the amendments to the Watts report presented by my group concerning social standards have been thrown out; yet the importance of the human factor is highlighted in each case. It is a matter of great urgency that measures be adopted to put an end to social dumping and to review the conditions of crews in terms of status, salaries, training and working conditions. To enable effective control to be carried out in ports it is necessary to reinforce the body of maritime inspectors and their qualifications, and hence to free up financial resources. Much more stringent measures must be imposed to make classification societies effective. Flags of convenience must be banned. The consequences of their use in terms of non-compliance with standards are well known. Yes, it is time that the European Union committed itself to actually reforming the maritime system. This demands a strong political will and the financial resources to put in place even more controls. In the run-up to the second package of proposals it seems important to me that we turn our thoughts to promoting the lasting development of maritime safety, which will involve yet further guarantees of safety and quality.

Madam President, I believe that the BSE crisis that broke out in 1996 has revealed the extent to which ultraliberalism can lead to the health of consumers and the interests of livestock producers being sacrificed. The work of this Parliament’s committee of enquiry contributed to the application of measures to protect consumer health: in particular by banning animal meal for cattle and through the compulsory labelling of beef. But fraud, negligence and the lack of adequate measures mean that the BSE crisis is still not under control, since new cases are being discovered all the time. Without becoming paranoid, we must recognise that the consumers’ concern is perfectly legitimate. My group believes that the health of consumers is an imperative which should have overriding priority over all other considerations. It is therefore urgent that measures are taken to reassure consumers and to restore their confidence in food safety. I do not know if this is a panacea, Commissioner but, in line with the precautionary principle, it seems to me that experience behoves us to ban, as of today, the use of animal meal in feed for livestock, including pigs, poultry and fish. Detection tests must also be extended to all cattle entering the human food chain. The current crisis has led to a significant slump in sales and to a fall in prices, which are hurting livestock producers and all those involved in the beef sector. It is necessary both to restore consumer confidence and to help the livestock producers affected by the crisis. Selective aid, such as market support and a grass subsidy, are essential. But, beyond the immediate future, should we not be reflecting on the mechanisms of the CAP? Are these not the very mechanisms which are at the root of the problem? They have contributed to overly intensive production, which has harmed the environment and the quality of farm products. They therefore need to be reviewed. Perhaps it would be no bad thing if animals returned to traditional fodder. I feel like saying, “Yes, let them have a bit more grass.” But the European Union must also encourage the production of oil seeds so that animal meal can be replaced by vegetable meal. To achieve this, there would have to be a re-examination of the 1993 GATT agreement, which prohibits the European Union producing more than 25% of its vegetable protein requirements so as to satisfy US exports.

 Madam President, I do not underestimate the very important ambition of establishing a community of humanitarian values or the fact that civil, political and social rights have been placed on a par for the first time in this type of text. I also see the method instigated with the Convention as innovatory with regard to ensuring greater information and greater transparency. Despite all that, however, there is a major source of dissatisfaction. There is a significant gap between our initial ambitions and what we have actually achieved. It is, of course, possible to highlight this or that article, to welcome the genuine progress made in affirming a number of new rights relating to developments in our societies or in reaffirming crucial fundamental rights. It is also possible to pinpoint articles which fall a long way short of the rights acknowledged elsewhere, particular in social issues. We should not be drawing up lists of advantages and disadvantages, Madam President. Last time, you spoke of the glass being half full or half empty. We should instead be looking at the Charter in terms of its overall approach and ambition and asking ourselves whether it actually lives up to the demands and expectations of the citizens of Europe and whether it provides them with adequate support to confront the challenges of the age. Well, I have read the text. I have read it again and again. It is, indeed, a text that is easy to read. I have heard the arguments put forward by my fellow Members, but I still think that the Charter contains some ambiguous provisions that are very dangerous and that the common denominator is still the lowest possible one. Finally, in spite of the innovative approach of the Convention method, which I have mentioned, things must be stated openly. The citizens of Europe have continued to be insufficiently informed and if they had been consulted, as should have been necessary, in order to contribute towards drawing up the Charter, then its content would almost certainly have been rather different. It is never too late to set things right. Nice should not be just the finish line for the Charter, an opportunity to express self-satisfaction. It would be wise to also make it the starting point for the widest possible “citizens’ debate” regarding this so important issue of fundamental rights. Finally, precisely because the decision on the Charter is a major political decision, I am with those Members of the House that think it premature for Parliament to declare its opinion today.

 Madam President, President-in-Office of the Council, Commissioner, while progress has been made on closer cooperation and the extension of qualified majority voting, deep-seated disagreement persists, as you yourself have underlined, concerning the composition of the Commission and the weighting of votes in Council. It is indeed a fact that there are still major differences of opinion between larger countries and the smaller countries, which fear the stronger countries setting up a type of cabinet. So, in speaking of the Biarritz spirit, I believe that in essence Biarritz reflects the complexity of the challenges facing the Union. I view it as expressing, along the line of other summits, even if it was an informal one, the contradictions that exist between social requirements and citizens’ demands, the expectations of the peoples of Europe, and the free-market rationale that continues to hold sway in the European Union. There is a pressing need to work out a new design for an enlargement that unites rather than divides, that involves the candidate countries in the work of the Intergovernmental Conference and pays far greater attention to the social dimension of enlargement. I would therefore reiterate my Group’s commitment to a reform that guarantees balance between the European institutions and also between the Member States, and in doing so smaller countries being marginalised. A reform that also increases transparency and democracy and at last enables the general public to participate in the drafting of European policies. Biarritz also saw the unanimous adoption of the Charter of Fundamental Rights and, yes, there was indeed great ambition and a novel method. For the first time in a document of this type, civil, political and social rights were placed on an equal footing, with a commitment to establishing a Community of human values. I do not for all that share in the Presidency’s satisfaction, and can only regret the fact that the content of the Charter fails to live up to requirements and expectations, not least as regards social issues. I would also express the wish of my Group and of a good many NGOs to see the Charter evolve and continue to improve, in order to guarantee, amongst other things, more effective protection and rights for the citizens of the European Union, for employees, for the citizens of third countries and for the socially marginalised. The Council would truly satisfy the expectations of European citizens if it were to launch a widespread consultation of individual communities and national parliaments, culminating in a charter that genuinely met people’s needs. Finally, concerning international issues, I, like others here, am keen to hail the return of democracy to Serbia. It is very important, as part of the process that has started, for the Union to contribute to the reconstruction, stability and promotion of human rights in all the countries of the former Yugoslavia. Concerning the Middle East, all the signs following Sharm-el-Sheikh are that the peace process depends on certain undertakings being honoured, beginning with the full and comprehensive implementation of the UN resolutions, an end to Israeli colonisation of the occupied territories, the right of displaced Palestinians to return to their lands, and the recognition of a Palestinian state which has East Jerusalem as its capital. I too hope that Nice European Council is a success and welcome the fact that the peoples of Europe, and large numbers of associations, NGOs and trade unions are investing time and effort in preparing for it.

 Mr President, now that we have had a return to growth, it is crucial for the European Union to provide itself with the means to meet expectations in the social sector. The Commission communication highlights a raft of ambitious objectives, such as full employment, equal opportunities, training, etc., but there are many contradictions between the European Union’s declared ambitions and its political decisions. Among other aspects, let me cite the concern for productivity, which generally involves wage moderation as a priority. I would therefore like to join my fellow Members in congratulating Anne Van Lancker on her report, which opens up new perspectives, with an approach which aims for greater precision and greater coherence. Her report appreciably builds on the Commission’s proposals by suggesting the harmonisation of social regulations and the coordination of national social legislation. It calls for a genuine European agreement to be framed in favour of employment and social cohesion and proposes initiatives on the gradual reduction of working time prior to retirement, the introduction of a minimum wage and cross-border supervision in relation to social and fiscal law. This is all a specific encouragement to go beyond laudable intentions and actually take practical action. Moreover, at a time when a great many employees of major European industrial groups face redundancy plans in the context of mergers and restructuring, I think it important for the report on the social agenda to take a stand in favour of taking social clauses into consideration in competition policy, in favour of directives to this end and in favour of a revision of the European Works Council Directive as well as the directive on redundancies. This, I feel, is part of the consistent approach which we are lacking. I am pleased to see, furthermore, that Mrs Van Lancker has included a number of amendments tabled by my Group, particularly that on factoring in the social dimension of enlargement and incorporating the right to strike into Community legislation. Together with my Group, I have tabled some amendments criticising the Commission’s approach calling for the adoption of wage restraint. I advocate the reduction of working times without a concomitant reduction in salaries. Having said that, I support Anne Van Lancker’s report, which has the great merit of adopting an ambitious social policy backed up by specific objectives which go beyond the usual purely formal declarations.

 Mr President, the recent Taliban offensives must obviously concern us. Terrible suffering has been caused by this conflict. I, too, support the joint resolution, of course. But I want to join previous speakers in emphasising two concerns. The first issue is the position of women. It is not something we can get used to it. We must never trivialise it. They still endure appalling conditions: they are denied access to work, health care and education. They live in destitution and permanent insecurity. They are regularly victims of stonings. They are suppressed in the true sense of the word. All Afghan women, whatever their age, are faced with systematic violation of their most fundamental rights. That is why I also believe they should be entitled to the right of asylum. The European Union must renew its solidarity with all Afghan women in their struggle at home and abroad against the Taliban regime. The second issue is that the Taliban are clearly seeking international recognition, on the grounds that they now control virtually all of Afghanistan. So peace, stability and respect for rights can only be re-established through a political solution. Greater involvement of the European Union is definitely needed. And in that search, I believe it is vital for the Council to reinforce the restrictions it has decided on. There can be no recognition by any Member State, as long as Afghanistan maintains its policy of violation of human rights, notably its systematic discrimination against women. The Commission should also take much stronger emergency humanitarian measures for the people, doing everything possible to enable the NGOs to provide aid to Afghan women and involve them in their activities.

 Mr President, Mr Prodi has referred to the referendum in Denmark, the outcome of which I believe reflects a malaise that extends far beyond that country. Many European citizens are questioning the point reached by the Union, its objectives and even the logic of integration. We say that there is a crisis of confidence with regard to the institutions, and I feel that this crisis is due in particular to the disparity between the expectations of society and the ability to live up to them. While growth continues apace, inequalities have become increasingly intolerable. The call for equitable distribution has become even louder. There are also great expectations as concerns cooperation, transparency and public debate. We must learn to listen more closely. Despite the method adopted, which I welcome, the Charter of Fundamental Rights, which should be the social foundation stone of the European Union would not seem to match up either to the expectations or to the objectives set. Despite the constructive changes made in the final draft produced by the Convention, there is still great disparity between the contributions made by citizens' associations, their hopes and the results actually achieved. I would even go so far as to say that this Charter contains many ambiguities. There is still time to enhance it and, in doing so, to be far more receptive to the proposals made by many associations, trade unions and the progressive movement. The same applies to the priorities of employment, social integration and lifelong learning – highly important objectives that have been set, but whose realisation has foundered on the cold logic of the stability pact, on the dogma of liberalisation. Following on from what my fellow Member, Mr Wurtz, has said, I would like to stress the extent to which the vital reform of the institutions should address the issue of making the Union more democratic. There has been one gaping omission in all the remarks made on the subject of how it would be possible to create institutions enabling citizen participation. This is the prerequisite for a Europe of the peoples that is built to last.

 Mr President, the records for company mergers have now been broken in the telecommunications sector, with mega-mergers in Europe and on the other side of the Atlantic. These operations involve billions of dollars, and benefit consumers, who are also employees facing company closures, relocations and redundancies. The telecommunications sector has become a symbol of capitalist globalisation, which forces it to bear the cost of this race towards ever more enormous deals. The Lisbon Summit made several references to the information society. This is something which can indeed enable considerable progress to be made. There is no doubting that this is a challenge! Nowadays these changes are generally matched by a dismantling of social rights, an increase in part-time work and flexibility at work. Nor can we ignore the consequences for the freedom of information, cultural diversity and public services. The Commission banned the merger between MC Worldcom and Sprint solely because it might threaten free competition. At a time, however, when the European Union is making employment a priority, mergers should also be seen in light of their consequences for employment and land-use planning. We should also increase the employees’ and union organisations’ rights and powers on the boards of European companies and perhaps even give them a right of veto in the event of restructurings or mergers. Lastly, common regulations should be promoted so that the information society benefits all citizens and is based on equality of access, freedom of information and cultural diversity.

) Mr President, Commissioner, I think there is some ambiguity regarding the expression “single European sky”, because air traffic control is in fact, as you are well aware, already a European field of activity. There is already a European system for controlling the air space with Eurocontrol and there is already a body, the Central Flow Management Unit, based in Brussels. This is not perfect, of course, but they do already exist. The situation must therefore be improved starting with the statement, which is patently obvious, that delays have increased and that with traffic on the rise, they will become worse. It is recognised that there are many causes of delays but, in the end, I find that we are facing an offensive presenting air traffic control as the only reason for delays. I believe it would be sensible also to concentrate far more on the problems of types of plane, types of flow, stopovers and of course the continuing defence-related problems. I feel as if we are involved in a headlong pursuit to implement solutions that seem obvious, but that do not take account of the specificity of air traffic control. Mr Zimeray said this earlier: yes, a plane journey is divided into different areas and the denser the traffic, the more divisions there are. Why? Because dividing things into different areas is the human way of controlling or managing a number of aircraft. Therefore, in my opinion, thinking that there would be too many control centres is nonsense. Why not say in that case that there are too many aircraft? In addition, as far as I know, there are no specific air traffic control hold-ups at borders either. The great proposal that is put to us for improving traffic consists of separating regulatory and control functions. But what is the value of such a measure? It may well be necessary to consider more relevant divisions, why not? But that is not what is being proposed. The separation of functions would lead to the liberalisation of air traffic service provision, establishing, as indeed the Atkins report states, a liberalised internal market. Air traffic control is not an airline, nor is it a market sector. Let it not be forgotten that its main function is to ensure safety. I believe, however, that it is contrary to the interests of safety to subject aircraft control and monitoring bodies to market pressure. The ability to invest in new technological tools and training must therefore be safeguarded. In France – and I am not trying to make France a model – there is a general directorate that governs everything and, in the past few years, investments have been made and air traffic controllers have been recruited. The system is highly effective. On what grounds would you want to break... (The President cut the speaker off)

 Mr President, rail transport is very important in terms of citizens’ mobility, the development of trade within Europe and in terms of the environment and regional planning.  The European Parliament has already paved the way for the liberalisation of international freight transport at its first reading, by granting authorised applicants track access rights. This rail package was the subject of a Council compromise in December.  The Council suggests that the choice of authorised applicants should be left to Member States’ discretion, that the freight rail networks be opened up using a specific network called the “Trans-European Rail Freight Network” and, lastly, that the division into separate entities only take place progressively.  I note, without any satisfaction, that the Council’s position also takes account of the various national situations and grants each State the right to determine their own choices and for example, to pursue cooperation commitments. However, we are faced with an ultraliberal proposition at this second reading. The amendments tabled sanction the overall fragmentation of the rail system, which would mark the end of subsidiarity for the authorised applicants in 5 years’ time and mean that the separation of entities would not be achieved progressively. It would also mean the complete opening up of international and national freight transport and, by 2010, of passenger transport.  Just a few moments ago we were speaking about electricity and on Thursday we shall address the issue of the single European sky. Throughout the public sector the same refrain is heard: liberalise, it’s magic! In my view, rail transport would be left with an enormous bill. Rail companies would be forced into the role of service provider, which would create unfair competition. While the service providers benefit from the largest part of the commercial margin and are free to choose the most profitable sectors, the rail companies on the other hand are left to bear the high equipment and personnel costs.  In opposition to the argument advanced regarding the increase in traffic, this system might cause the isolation and disastrous creaming off of the more profitable sectors. This same dogma is aimed solely at gaining profits through liberalisation, and users and employees do not get a say. No proper preliminary study was undertaken and what is more, I think that we should take time to study the impact of the decisions taken by the Council. It would also be useful to compare – in relation to the freight paths – the private and the public sector.  If the proposals from this second reading are adopted, they would be considered as a real provocation by all involved in the sector. I can neither endorse them, nor the amendments tabled by the Socialist Group that suggest a need for further opening up on the path to liberalisation.

 The fundamental purpose of the proposal for a Commission directive is to overhaul the current directives, specifically those that deal with the tar content in cigarettes and the labelling of tobacco products. The proposal also seeks to complement current provisions by taking account of scientific progress and increasing the level of public health protection. One of the merits of this directive is that it clarifies existing laws; it harmonises regulations between Member States, it improves consumer protection and supports the campaign against smoking. I am in favour of this directive and I think that the obscene press campaign mounted by the tobacco multinationals is scandalous. These companies care nothing for people’s health and are only concerned with their market share and their profits. It is also essential that we adopt international measures to curb the offensive with which these companies are targeting developing countries, where they are stepping up advertising and propaganda campaigns, which are neither restricted nor monitored. I am in favour of the Commission’s proposal, and also of the amendments tabled in the report by the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Consumer Policy, which will improve public health protection.   Moreover, we should not deceive ourselves as to the problems we are facing, with the decision to threaten aid to Community tobacco production. We must take the socio-economic aspects of this production into consideration. We must also address these problems, undertake a process, and realise that the European Union imports almost 80% of the tobacco it consumes. That is why I have co-signed an amendment, which calls for respect for Community preference in order to reduce the share of American multinational companies in tobacco consumption.

 Mr President, as everyone is pointing out, the euro has just lost almost 30% of its value in sixteen months, but the European Commission, like the Central Bank, does not seem to be in much of a hurry to learn the lessons of this experience, as that would be liable to challenge the current monetary policy which benefits only stock exchange transactions and speculation. The ambition to achieve full employment and a modern economy, as declared in Lisbon, are indeed laudable objectives, but they are now effectively coming up against the liberal yoke. In its document on the broad economic guidelines, the Commission pursues this liberal approach, and these guidelines now represent the reference text for the coordination of economic policy in the Member States. The Commission, indeed, shows no compunction in issuing orders to this or that State with a view to drawing up its budget. It clearly stresses the target of budgetary streamlining, even going beyond the requirements of the Stability Pact. Following the example of the Central Bank, it demands wage moderation as well as structural reform of the labour market, especially in order to make it more flexible. The Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs’ report is in line with this approach and with the continuation of the Lisbon decisions. It advocates accelerating the liberalisation process as well as the process of applying pressure to wages. It proposes increasing the flexibility of the labour market. This is why I am unable to approve of the guidelines contained in this report, especially when made exacerbated by the many amendments introduced by the right wing. The current economic situation, particularly with the decline in the euro, ought to lead the Union and the Member State governments to strive towards the reorientation of European policy, so as to enable it at last to fulfil expectations regarding social issues. We must shake up the dogma of the Stability Pact. We must reverse the current approach, which makes social policy nothing more than a consequence of economic and monetary policy, responsible only for making good the damage caused by the market by means of a policy of aid. This new policy should be particularly based on support to investment that creates jobs by means of a selective policy of credit, the improvement in living and working conditions and a reduction of working hours without flexibility or increased precariousness, taxation on income and financial measures to curb speculation and to release new resources.

 Commissioner, I too remember the European Union introducing a regulation in 1993 on the organisation of the market in bananas, so as to ensure protection of outlets and income for Community producers and to guarantee the exports of the ACP countries to the Community market. Although they do not produce a single kilo of bananas, the United States has complained to the WTO about the Community banana import regime. Their one aim was to defend the interests of their great banana companies which are effectively ravaging Latin America and which already dominate over 70% of the world market. In 1999, the WTO panel, orchestrated by the United States, condemned the Community’s import licences system. The Commission has submitted to that verdict by amending the market conditions to end up with a ‘tariff only’ system in 2006. The implementation of this new regulation, which actually goes beyond the WTO ruling, would call into question the distribution of Community and ACP products and would aggravate an already fragile social situation, especially in the French Overseas Territories where the selling price of bananas had already fallen below 3 francs in 1998 and was less than 2 francs in 1999. I am glad the Committee on Agriculture has rejected not only the amendments championed by the intermediaries of the American multinationals, but also the Commission’s proposals.  I entirely approve of the Dary report which opposes the automatic move to a ‘tariff only’ system and which defends the principles which presided over the establishment of the common organisation of markets, especially Community preference. By adopting the Dary report, we will be sending the Council and the Commission the clear signal that our Parliament is determined to defend the interests of Community and ACP producers, to make the WTO recognise that the preferential agreements constitute development aid instruments. Our vote will also express our rejection of any compromise with the United States that would sacrifice the Community and ACP producers to the profit of the dollar banana.

 Mr President, the ageing of the population and the reduction in the numbers of people of working age, while real enough, have been put forward by the Commission and other Members as a reason to open up the way for pension funds for supplementary pension schemes. The dynamic of growth and job creation has run its course. The capitalisation mechanisms mean adapting retirement pensions to the single market and the introduction of the euro. Moving in this direction entails the risk of a system based on private insurance, which would gradually replace social security. Welfare and retirement pensions would no longer be rights but would be commodities subject to the laws of the market. The set pension fund strategy essentially aims to drain savings away toward the financial markets. A system of this type is very dangerous and deeply unfair as it benefits the richest people, those who can save money, and leaves the poorest with a pittance of a retirement pension. Mr Kuckelkorn’s initial report considered the retirement pension primarily as social insurance against certain life risks, rather than a process of accumulating capital. It has been radically changed, however, by the adoption of amendments unreservedly supporting the mechanisms of capitalisation. I cannot, therefore, approve this report which makes the Commission’s approach even worse. On the contrary, we think that a high level of social protection must be maintained, based on solidarity, regardless of financial profitability. The contributory system guarantees the rights of the employed and provides them with a pension, in the framework of national solidarity between the working population and the retired population, between generations, between men and women, between the public and the private sectors. The objective should be to obtain new resources and to upgrading the purchasing power of retirement pensions from contributions which could be raised from taxes on financial products at the same level as those which apply to wages. Employers’ contributions should be linked to companies’ employment policies and taxes set up on those which make people redundant.

 Mr President, Mr Kirkhope’s report has the virtue of drawing the Council’s attention to a dreadful criminal activity. While I support the action stipulated by the report, and I too would like to congratulate the rapporteur, I still think the proposed measures do not match up to the scale of the problem before us. Communication technologies transform data. The Internet thus has formative and demultiplying effects on the trade and traffic in child pornography. This trafficking is on a scale hitherto unknown in terms of its extent and the geographical areas covered. It is an urgent state of affairs, and specific action must be proposed in order to deal with the networks that exist. In all the States of the Union, individual paedophile acts are suppressed, but ignorance and inefficiency still reign in the suppression of networks. What we have to deal with here are ephemeral, evolving sites, which adapt constantly and which are complicated to monitor. This state of affairs makes it essential to draw up a survey of paedophile networks within the countries of the European Union. The existence of these networks confirms the need for a common judicial area. Once again, the rapporteur urges the Union to approach the Member States, and ask them to make an effort to harmonise their national legislation in this area. I share his opinion but, given the cross-border nature of the problem, the response must be at Union level. The common judicial area does exist with Europol, Schengen and Eurodac. Let it be noted that it is used primarily, and indeed exclusively, to control the flow of migration and to suppress illegal immigration. But even if action was undertaken in each Member State to create specialised units working in liaison, as the report advocates, that would not solve the problem of the networks because their work would still be restricted by national borders. There is no problem identifying the parties involved in trafficking child pornography, who are often repeat offenders. What is needed is prevention, in order to counter their activities and to dismantle their networks. The European Union must provide itself with a suitable structure, a European instrument to enforce information exchange and action. This instrument must be such as to make it possible to address States directly in order to urge them to pass on information, but also to issue orders so that the networks can be dismantled. The Union should be in a position to apply penalties to any State which does not fulfil its criminal law obligations in the matter of combating paedophilia. The Dutch police have drawn up a file of several hundred children from a CD-ROM containing 10 000 images or sequences of child pornography available on the Internet. Interpol has acknowledged having a file of 800 photos. Why are these valuable documents not used? Who are these children and what is being done to locate them? If there are records of offenders, it must be possible to keep records of victims. It is our duty, ethically, as human beings, to do everything we can to find them. For all these reasons I think the European Union must make combating this form of crime a priority. Mr Kirkhope’s report is filled with good intentions, but further proposals must be made in order to deal with the present situation. I think the Commission and the Council should take action which is up to the task of dealing with the high stakes of this crime that affects thousands of innocents.

 Mr President, confronted with the worrying development of sex tourism and, more generally, the sexual exploitation of children in Europe and throughout the world, Mrs Klamt is quite right to put forward measures in her report which are adequate to deal with the serious problem before us. I particularly recall measures such as the inclusion of children’s rights in the Charter of Fundamental Rights and the setting up of free telephone helplines for children. There is an urgent need for a coherent policy for the protection of children to be implemented. I therefore support Amendment No 4 calling for a European centre for missing children and victims of sexual abuse to be set up in order to coordinate the activities of the organisations set up in the Member States. The Commission must undertake to actually establish this European database. I wish to point out that Parliament has already adopted resolutions on this subject. It must be noted that the proposals made have only been implemented in part. Much more effective measures are required. Finally, I must alert the House to the latest developments. It is now not just sex tourists who are travelling to third countries; we now have children being sent here, to Europe, like so many items sent by parcel post. Considering, then, the transnational nature of the problem, I think that we should demand that Europol supports national and transnational inquiries and gives an annual report of its work.

Mr President, the peace process in the Western Sahara initiated and led by the Secretary-General of the United Nations looked promising. The eligible voters were identified thanks to the effective UN mission, MINURSO. But the Moroccan Government has artificially stepped up the number of appeals concerning voters, a clear sign that it wants to prevent the holding of the referendum on self-determination. Nor has it confined itself to these delaying tactics. In recent weeks it has embarked on violent repression of the Sahrawi people, in the form of arrests, disappearances and the introduction of a real state of siege in the occupied territories. In its motion for a resolution, my Group reaffirms the right of the Sahrawi people to self-determination and calls on Morocco to call an end to all forms of repression and to apply in full the Houston Agreements to which it has subscribed. The United Nations must do its utmost to ensure that the referendum is held before the end of 2000. I call on the Council and the governments of the Member States, in particular France and Spain, to stop being so accommodating vis-à-vis the Moroccan authorities and to involve themselves more actively in the success of the peace plan and the holding of the referendum, for that is the most appropriate democratic means of achieving a peaceful and lasting settlement of the conflict in Western Sahara.

 The goal of full employment which reappears on the agenda whenever growth returns is clearly an admirable intention. It is difficult to achieve, however, without attacking the real causes of unemployment. Despite current growth, job creation in Europe is notoriously inadequate. Those jobs which are created tend to be precarious, particularly where they involve women and young people. We must move away from simple declarations of intent, no matter how positive they may be. In view of the extremely high social expectations, we must urgently define measurable and verifiable objectives. What I would have liked to see was a commitment on the proposals indicated in my Group’s motion such as: – The introduction of a process for reducing working time without any loss of wages or flexibility; – A review of the directives on Euroworks councils and collective redundancies to reinforce the rights and powers of employees and their trade unions, particularly in the event of mergers and restructuring; – The establishment at Community level of taxation on speculative capital movements and reinforcement of the fight against fraud and tax evasion. I deeply regret that we are not embarking on a new type of sustainable development, based on the fairer distribution of wealth, an increase in the purchasing power of households and the stimulation of public and social investment. For all these reasons we will vote against the joint motion.

 Mr President, over two months after the wreck of the Erika
, pollution of the coasts, which have already been cleaned once, is still continuing. While reiterating my solidarity with all the victims of this, I should like to salute the dedication of the workers, professionals and volunteers, who are still involved in cleaning the polluted beaches. Thanks to the grass-roots involvement, which this House furthered by organising a debate and adopting a resolution on 20 January, an initial raft of measures has been announced. The French Government has initiated a discussion and made proposals to strengthen maritime safety, particularly by fighting against the phenomenon of flags of convenience and by implementing much more extensive inspection. The lessons of this latest oil slick must be learnt in full, and decisions must be taken speedily at Community level to prevent coffin ships sailing off our shores or berthing in our ports, to make double hulls mandatory for the transportation of pollutants, and to strengthen standards for safety and inspection. We must also demand that the parties truly responsible be made to pay the costs incurred due to the pollution. So, yes, Total Fina must provide the financial resources to contribute to the repair of ecological, economic and social damage and to compensate the people affected by the disaster. The French State has released funds for compensating damage. I feel, however, that the European Union has so far not actually come up with any expression of Community solidarity at the requisite level. So, yes, appropriations must be released at Community level to support the cleaning of the contaminated coastlines, to assist the organisations which went into action to save oil-covered birds, and to contribute towards getting the affected businesses back on their feet. Specific compensation should be provided for the fishermen and shellfish farmers who have suffered considerable loss of income and who face having to invest considerable sums in order to repair everything and regain consumer confidence. I was pleased to hear the statement which Commissioner Fischler has just made, and I take careful note of the commitments he made before this House. I should also like to say that my Group shall remain vigilant and committed, in collaboration with the grass-roots action groups, to ensuring that the parties affected receive compensation as soon as possible and that legislation is strengthened at every level, supported by realistic penalties in the event of non-compliance.

 Considering the employment situation in the Community and the European Union’s declared ambition to steadfastly attack unemployment, the analysis of mergers carried out by the Commission should take elements other than competition into consideration. As an example I would give the restructuring of ABB Alsthom Power. A sizeable delegation of employees of this firm from throughout Europe is visiting Strasbourg today. The management of ABB Alsthom Power, following a merger carried out in June 1999, announced restructuring where there is already the prospect of layoffs in a number of countries. This damaging situation for employment raises many questions, particularly regarding the information given to the European Works Council, in existence since 1996. It suggests that the Community directive on European Works Councils must be updated and strengthened. It also requires the monitoring of mergers taking employment, the environment and consumers into consideration. Since the report of the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs did not go far enough in this respect, I abstained.

 Madam President, I am to give the speech which should have been made by my fellow Member, Geneviève Fraisse. She joins the protests made by Mrs Theorin this morning. I am pleased that the European Commission feels responsible for following up the Beijing Conference. Yet we need precision in order to ensure effectiveness. The same applies to the situation of women today, as much in terms of equality – education, citizenship and employment – as freedom – habeas corpus, the fight against violence and the trading of women. We must therefore be precise. In order for this European meeting to be successful and not just the scene of some fine words, the following conditions must be met. A European conference may be held in parallel with a UN meeting if, and only if, this works to produce an internal European policy and demonstrates a common determination within the UN dynamic. The Finnish Presidency must be thanked for having identified nine indicators for assessing the access of women to decision making. Would it not be judicious to generalise these quantitative methods? Gender-based statistics must be provided in all areas. Additional indicators must also be identified to measure the situations of inequality in fields other than politics. Could we not also comprehensively assess the means which Europe, as such, has had for several decades to develop equal opportunities, particularly in terms of compatibility between family and professional life, and to combat all violence against women? Without any common indicators, no serious assessment can be made of the measures taken by the Member States. The conference in February 2000 could have this specific and formative policy as its objective. The future enlargement of Europe, confirmed by the Helsinki conclusions, poses the problem of the applicant States respecting the requirements of developing equal opportunities and promoting women’s freedom. In these countries as elsewhere, the role of the NGOs, particularly since Beijing, has become indisputable. The Commission must be a capable participant in the work undertaken by these associations.

 Madam President, in refusing to lift the ban on British beef and veal, the French Government has decided to face a limited and short-lived crisis with its European partners rather than risk a scandal breaking in a few months or years linked to Creutzfeldt-Jakob Disease. This decision is based on the scientific conclusions of the French Food Safety Agency which, while acknowledging that progress has been made, has identified continuing and serious potential risks, as demonstrated by the persistence of the disease. Seattle has also affected this decision, with the growing importance of the precautionary principle and the pre-eminence of health over the market. There is no point today in making things worse or in exacerbating Francophobe or Anglophobe feelings. We are right to be careful. It is the inadequacy of the guarantees on the definition and implementation of testing programmes and, in particular, the lack of European regulation on labelling and traceability, which has led France to this decision. In addition to these elements, the efforts made in recent weeks, which no one disputes, must be clarified and supplemented in particular by the establishment of a compulsory labelling and traceability system from the producer to the consumer. This would clearly allow the consumer to be reassured and would also combat the re-routing of products in the context of triangular trade. Beyond this specific case, should we not be working to impose the pre-eminence of the precautionary principle over all other considerations in trade, both within the EU and with third countries? Are the Commission and Council not using a similar approach to that of the French Government in rightly opposing the lifting of the ban on hormone-treated meat originating from the United States of America, despite the WTO injunctions?

 Mr President, on the eve of the Seattle Conference, I still think it unfortunate that we are going into a fresh round of negotiations before making a serious assessment of the one before. The fact that millions of individuals are affected by the consequences of the decisions which are to be taken there does, however, make this necessary. Those in favour of the liberalisation of trade as the driving force for prosperity are all the less willing to undertake such a report, since there can be no real denial that the situation has become worse in recent years, and inequalities between underdeveloped countries and advanced countries, as well as the development of inequalities even within developed countries, have intensified. When wealth is concentrated at one extreme and there is an increase in unemployment at the other, one may well wonder if the WTO has not primarily served to institutionalise the law of the jungle. As a matter of urgency, a new concept of trade between nations must be promoted, based on solidarity, cooperation, democracy and the promotion of employment and social rights. However, so that all of this does not simply remain a vain hope, decisions must be taken, I believe, in three areas. Firstly, formalise the principle whereby these negotiations must be of use to disadvantaged countries and populations, affirming the right of the European Union and the Member States to defend their development policy and specific agreements with the ACP and the refusal to let the Lomé Conventions be challenged by the WTO. Secondly, insist on the primacy of the interests of peoples in preference to commercial and financial criteria. I have three proposals relating to this. Of course, they are not comprehensive. Firstly, subject WTO regulations to the international charter and conventions governing matters of human rights and social, health and environmental issues. In saying this, I am thinking of Kyoto, Peking and Copenhagen. Next, refuse to continue to liberalise services and, on the contrary, assist the development of cooperation of public services in education, health and transport. Finally, maintain the principle of cultural exception, affording the European Union and the Member States the possibility of preserving their capability of freely determining their audiovisual cultural policy in the name of development of a thriving and enriching diversity. One more proposal: establish the precautionary principle for the environment, health and food safety as an absolute priority. Finally, the third area. Radical democratisation of the structures of the WTO is essential. There must be democratic supervision of the negotiations and of the implementation of agreements. The presence of NGOs, representatives of society and of trade unions, with the status of observers, must be accepted in these negotiations. What is more, all the points negotiated at the WTO must be ratified by the European Parliament and by national parliaments. Today the WTO itself is decreeing the laws, monitoring their application, and settling disputes. I think it is not possible to be both judge and judged. The dispute settlement body must be radically modified.

 Mr President, Commissioner, paradox it may be, but the Menrad report has again brought unemployment to the fore within the European arena. This is a bad time for employment in Europe, with seventeen million unemployed and sixty million people living in poverty. If employment levels have remained identical to the 1994 levels within the Community, this is principally due to the massive loss of job security. We are really far short of the target. The Union needs to be ambitious in its employment policies, it needs voluntarist and binding policies, breaking away from the destructive rationale that is currently at work. At a time when money should be used to meet the needs of men and women, the needs of society, the Michelin case is a symbol of the tyranny of the law of filthy lucre over the economy and over individuals. The citizens of Europe are waiting for clear signals from Parliament. In order to be effective, then, the guidelines should include quantifiable objectives enforcing job creation. Reduction of working hours without reducing wages, without job flexibility or insecurity, should be the order of the day as we approach the year 2000. The Union should be ambitious in using money in favour of employment, monitoring public funds awarded to businesses, with a credit policy which penalises destructive practices and promotes job creation. Finally, declaring equal opportunities means that we must reject any form of discrimination against women, particularly with regard to wages. Mr Menrad has done a good job in difficult conditions, to be sure. The report includes many good points, but it does not, in my opinion, live up to our demands and expectations, despite taking a series of amendments debated in the Commission into account. It is not surprising, therefore, that a series of crucial amendments have again been proposed here by my own group and others. Whether these amendments are taken on board by this House will demonstrate the real will of Parliament.

 Mr President, I would nevertheless like to point out that by deciding not to lift the ban on British beef, France, in the case in point, is merely applying the Treaty which gives each State the opportunity to ban or restrict imports in order to protect the health and life of humans and animals. Personally, I am delighted that the precautionary principle has taken precedence over free trade.  The reasons put forward by France to justify its decision are not false pretexts masking some kind of protectionism. They are based on serious scientific arguments made by AFSSA, a totally independent scientific body. Its studies show that the BSE epidemic is far from being under control. I am not, of course, going to become embroiled in a war of figures, as there are quite a few other people who are ready to do so. Moreover, the British committee of experts does not contest these figures, which have been taken up by the director of Public Health in Scotland, who has stated, “I am aware of the fact that there is a risk to human health in this country.” Too many cases of BSE are occurring in cattle born after the ban on animal meal. How can this be explained unless we recognise the fact that the eradication programme implemented in Great Britain has still to be fine tuned? Furthermore, animal traceability has not been guaranteed. There is nothing to ensure that only animals born after 1 August 1996, aged between 6 and 30 months, are put on the market France, moreover is not the only country to adopt this position. Although Germany has not formally decided to lift the ban, it is dragging its feet over applying it. Indeed, has the Health Minister herself not just announced that the ban would only be lifted at some point before Christmas? I think that the European Commission’s decision to lift the ban is more political than scientific, as the differences in interpretation and points of view within the European Scientific Committee demonstrate.  Past experience of the European Commission’s poor handling of, and shortcomings in, the BSE affair do not inspire me with any blind faith in its decisions, to put it mildly.  Of course, in the light of the campaign which has been conducted in the British press, I do not think we should stir things up as some here are doing. I think that we should keep our heads and help to bring calm in order to guarantee the best protection of our fellow citizens’ health by keeping the risks to a minimum. Food safety has become something that society places great value on, something that I would say our fellow citizens are even demanding. This is why I feel that we should now ask the Scientific Committee to conduct more detailed scientific studies, taking the most recent data into account, whilst at the same time waiting for the screening tests which could be applied to live animals, and stepping up monitoring at all levels.  Only if these conditions are met will France be able to lift the ban with complete safety.

Mr President, I agree with Mr Lannoye that it is a question of rules, but the question is – which rules? Unfortunately, all the indications available to us show a desire to turn the future negotiations of the WTO into a further stage in the imposition of rules of liberalisation on a global scale. The European Commission has in fact announced, in its communication in July, that it wishes to liberalise new services, such as health, education, but also investments and public contracts. This wave of liberalisation is clearly justified in the name of the general interest and employment, as you stated, Mr Lamy, in your hearing, indicating that the progressive opening up of markets, both for goods and for services, is in the interest of the Community. However, it is not the results of the liberalisation initiated at Marrakech which are going to calm the fears which you spoke of just now. Did the Union make a serious appraisal in Marrakech? What I observe is that the poor countries are trapped in wretched circumstances and that here we are seeing an increase in unemployment and instability that goes hand in hand with huge profits. We are seeing great mergers and take-overs on a European and global scale. Yesterday and today, the employees of Michelin have been here, in this Parliament building, to dramatically illustrate this idea which governs relationships on a European and world scale. Financial viability comes first. But what about the human beings? What about thought? What about nature? What about solidarity? I do not believe that the choice is between liberalisation and protectionism. I am reassured by the fact that the MAI has been rejected, which shows that intervention is possible. A front could be developed to demand a change of direction. To this end, this Parliament has adopted an amendment from my group which requested a review of the mechanisms of the WTO and the rules procedure, in order to take more account of social, health, environmental and cultural questions. Today, 1,800 organisations are addressing us and calling for changes to the system. Developing countries are demanding a review of the previous agreement. I am also pleased to see that an Intergroup on WTO issues is about to meet. With my group I have taken the initiative to organise an open meeting on these matters during next November’s part-session. Many people expect the European Union to stand up in these negotiations for the values of cooperation, solidarity and the pre-eminence of human beings, as against financial values and the dictates of the market.

 Mr President, thank you, although I regret that Mr Patten has perhaps not had time to come back to the sitting. On several occasions, I, like others, have been deeply concerned about the unilateralism of the United States. The list is a long one, covering collective security, human rights, development and environmental protection. What type of proposal should be made with regard to trans-Atlantic relations just a few weeks away from the Dublin Summit? Would not the best ‘service’ the Union could do for this partnership be to display a critical attitude with respect to American views in several areas and, especially, to take the initiative in different directions? I am thinking first of all of the distressing situation in the Middle East. Mr Prodi has described the assassination of the Hamas leader as an illegal and irresponsible act. I also heard, and duly noted, what the Council said at this morning’s debate. However, just a few days since the green light was given by President Bush to continue with the policy of occupation and division of Palestinian territory, when is Europe going to decide to take the courageous initiatives that are required and that it has the means to implement: suspend the EU-Israel agreement, insist that an international protection force be sent, and convene an international conference involving in particular the protagonists of the Geneva agreement? In Iraq, the blinkered attitude of the Bush administration, producing daily human tragedies, should mean, in this area too, far greater involvement of the European Union so that a real transfer of sovereignty guaranteed by the UN can take place as soon as possible. This critical attitude is again of relevance with respect to the American plans for the Middle East as a whole, attempting to impose a ‘democracy kit’ from the outside, mainly to guarantee American economic and strategic interests as defined by President Bush. Finally, the needs of the war on terrorism cannot be used to justify a drift towards discriminatory security. Also, I am concerned about the statements made by the Council and the Commission today, going back over Parliament’s rejection of the transfer of air passengers’ personal data. Apart from clearly essential security measures, observing the rule of law, the response to terrorism must not ignore its causes. Taking the initiative within the IMF or the WTO with a view to alleviating inequalities throughout the world could, again, be a useful European contribution.

 Mr President, the annual report on human rights is once again, unfortunately, the occasion on which we acknowledge that the world situation is becoming worse. The law of the jungle and the option of repression and military intervention are supplanting the principles and values of international law. The war on terrorism is seen as justifying all-out aggression, in many regions of the world, against individual and collective freedoms. The list is a long one, and includes Turkey, where Leyla Zana and her companions have just been unjustly condemned, once again, for speaking out on behalf of the Kurdish people; Tunisia, where harassment and repression of any democrat are increasing, a phenomenon to which the European Union is indifferent; Morocco, where violations of the rights of the Sahrawi people are increasing in occupied Western Sahara; Iraq, where US occupying forces are causing real human tragedies, buying up the country’s natural resources at low prices and taking upon themselves the right to behave like masters, and Palestine where, in the words of Avraham Burg, the former Speaker of the Knesset, the situation is so explosive that, ‘crying out is a moral imperative’. One could also mention the intolerable harassment of those who defend human rights all over the world. According to the 2003 Annual Report of the International Federation for Human Rights Observatory for the Protection of Human Rights Defenders, ‘The present climate that focuses on security first and the implementation of arbitrary measures restricting individual freedoms undermines the principles of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights. In this context, it has become more and more difficult to denounce the adoption of restrictive laws, to defend the right to a fair trial, to fight against the death penalty and to condemn torture.’ In some countries, journalists, lawyers, political opponents and trade unionists have become real targets to be shot down. However, now more than ever, support and encouragement for these men and women in their struggle for democracy, justice and peace are proving to be vital to our common future. Finally, respect and guarantees for fundamental rights such as the right to sovereignty, the right to food self-sufficiency, the right to health, and the right to live in dignity and not in misery, are also playing their part in the building of a better world. In that sense I support the rapporteur’s action, particularly as regards reproductive health.

 The Italian Government’s initiative seeks to organise European charter flights for the ‘mass’ expulsion of third-country nationals. The European Council approved it even before receiving Parliament’s opinion. The Commission has announced EUR 30 million: this is an unacceptable way to proceed. It is the very idea of this initiative that must be rejected, however, as hundreds of organisations and thousands of European citizens have rightly demanded. The discriminatory, humiliating and degrading nature of this method of removal is a betrayal of the European Convention on Human Rights and the Charter of Fundamental Rights. More widely, an excessively security-conscious and repressive immigration policy is a threat to migrants, to international relations and to Europe itself. As Kofi Annan recently reminded us, we cannot close our doors and eyes to the world around us. On the contrary, Europe must be open to those who are prepared to risk everything to flee war, poverty and sometimes death. Europe’s need for an ambitious, humane and supportive common policy means instead that migrants should be considered agents of development. For that to be the case, we must abandon ‘fortress Europe’ as a matter of urgency and make sufficient money available for genuine cooperation and mutually advantageous development.

Mr President, I too share many of the views and proposals put forward by Mrs Boumediene-Thiery. To be brief, I should like to confine myself to the worries associated with the ultra-security-conscious approach that has just been confirmed by the last European Council. Following the American model, this positioning is dangerous and menacing; more to the point, it does not get to the roots of terrorism. Under the guise of fighting this curse, the legislation piling up in each of our countries is already giving rise to new infringements of human rights. I am thinking, for example, of the so-called preventative measures concerning the issue of visas in Germany, of the measures authorising the quasi-deportation of twenty-six thousand people in the Netherlands, of the measures in France that have brought about an increase in expulsions of more than a third in comparison with the start of 2003. The European position is getting further and further away from the universal principles of asylum and solidarity. Have not the Heads of State just flouted these principles by authorising de facto, as from 2005, the keeping of systematic records on all people living in Europe? The same attitude prevails in the draft directives aimed at harmonising asylum policy. Should we not therefore be worried, as the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees has just made clear, about the concept of safe third countries to which refugees can be passed on without any certainty about their safety? Finally, the same can be said of the European charters, which our Parliament has fortunately just rejected. On the contrary, the future of human rights in Europe will involve a genuine policy of welcome, equality of rights, including the right for everyone to vote and to be elected in all elections, and complete respect for the freedom of expression, including freedom of association.

Mr President, as the whole world has affirmed, the assassination of Sheikh Yassin by the Israeli army is a totally irresponsible provocation. Having participated in the establishment and development of Hamas with, at the time, the intention of weakening the PLO, the Israeli powers today seek to torpedo any idea of a peaceful solution. This brute-force approach has but one aim: that of destroying any hope of a negotiated peace with, as a consequence, the construction of the Wall imposed as the only acceptable solution. This shameful wall imprisons an entire nation, goes on annexing its land and resources and is overwhelmingly condemned by world opinion, as witnessed to by the debates of the United Nations Commission on Human Rights. Faced with this policy that is suicidal for both the Palestinians and the Israelis, the call by sixty key Palestinian figures to refrain from avenging the death of the Hamas leader is extremely dignified and courageous. It is high time the European Union supported them by clearly identifying Sharon as the main obstacle to peace; by specifically entering into official talks with those opposed to this policy of adopting the worst possible line, notably the pioneers of the Geneva Accord; by officially requesting the immediate deployment of an international force to protect the population of the Palestinian territories; and by suspending the agreement with Israel, as demanded by our Parliament two years ago. In short, by matching words with action in the interests of respect for international law. Any other approach is bound to fail and cannot be taken seriously under any circumstances, especially by Arab countries. While the American president continues to encourage Sharon, welcoming him in a few days’ time, the Union can no longer hide behind words. In a totally different spirit to the American plans for a Greater Middle East serving only their economic and strategic interests, Europe must finally take action if it wants to realise the ambition declared in Barcelona of bringing about a region of peace and prosperity. The proven lies concerning the reasons for armed intervention in Iraq and the new boost given to terrorism extending also into Europe drive us to take initiatives much bolder than those implied by what the Council and the Commission have told us today. An end to the occupation and the recognition of a sovereign and viable Palestinian State would also deprive the terrorists of a fertile breeding ground. It is peace in the region and throughout the world that is at stake.

 Mr President, yesterday, on International Women’s Day, a group of Palestinian women were received here, at the initiative of my group. They spoke to us of their weariness and of their daily struggle to survive in the refugee camps. They spoke of their courage and of their undying and dignified longing for peace. In particular, they spoke of their expectations of the European Union. As you will be aware, the last few days have been particularly murderous in the Gaza Strip. Fourteen Palestinians, three of them children, have been killed; dozens have been wounded, including Israeli soldiers, as if the announced withdrawal from the zone had to be preceded by acts of destruction with increasingly irreparable consequences. Tomorrow, you are invited to meet Israeli pacifists. These so-called refuseniks have also courageously refused to participate in the occupation at the heart of the spiral of murder in which the Palestinian and the Israeli people are caught up. Clearly, we are today considering in particular Israel’s violation of the rules of origin within the framework of the association agreement. It is impossible, however, not to consider at the same time all those other blatant violations committed on a daily basis in the Palestinian occupied territories. These violations are also a complete betrayal of the spirit of partnership enshrined in the agreement signed. Consequently, for those who want to believe in a just peace, the debates on the rights or wrongs of the application of this agreement are indicative of what has unfortunately been seen as a reprehensible excess of caution on the part of the European Union. One is obliged to recognise that Israel treats with derision Europe’s reprimands relating to violations of Article 2 on the respect of fundamental rights, as well as those concerning the rules of origin. Let us consider the rules of origin. Since 1976, Israel has determined the origin of the products it exports without distinguishing between products originating within its territory and those originating in the territories occupied since 1967. In other words, there is no distinction between its products and those of its settlements. In this way, Israel has continually issued certificates of origin to products that are not eligible for preferential treatment according to Community law. Had it been committed by any other country, such a violation would doubtless have lead to stringent retaliatory measures. Due to Israel’s customs practices, however, it has thus far been impossible for Member States to prevent these preferential imports or to impose taxes. Neither did the Commission, at first, propose adequate measures to combat these practices. Subsequently, the Commission announced that it was going to get down to the task of coordinating the ineffective actions of the Member States. Then the Commission spelt out its position, a clear and lawful position. On 10 May 2001, Commissioner Patten stated in the House that, ‘preferential access to the Community market for exports from the Israeli settlements, the West Bank and the Gaza Strip constitutes a violation of the EC-Israel trade agreements’. The measures taken, however, have failed to put an end to this unlawful practice. Furthermore, the ongoing construction of that shameful wall can only exacerbate the situation. Olive and fruit trees have been uprooted before the villagers’ very eyes. Agricultural land has been rendered inaccessible to thousands of local inhabitants. Will this new illegal annexation lead to still more exports of products from these areas? Last November, the European Union stressed before the EU-Israel Association Council the importance of resolving the problem of the rules of origin before any amendment of the protocol on these same rules. The Commission indicated that it has pursued these discussions with Israel since then. Nevertheless, the question still remains. I would like to ask you again, Commissioner, whether the Commission will accept a solution that does not require Israel to stop issuing certificates of origin to products from its settlements within the framework of the association agreement. Will the Commission use the legal instruments available to it? The possibility of amending the agreement is now being put forward. If we accept this principle, however, and if Israel continues to violate the agreement, the European Union could forfeit all its rights to suspend the application of any part of this agreement in order to stop the violation. This would be unacceptable. It would amount to deliberately flouting international law. It would mean recognising Israel as the occupying power in the Palestinian Territories and recognising Israel’s practice of annexing and colonising them. Be that as it may, I would like to make it clear, once again, that it is absolutely essential to consult Parliament before the agreement is amended in any way. Will the Commission undertake to do so? My conclusion is a general one. The European Union cannot continue to be complicit in the continuing occupation of the Palestinian Territories by Mr Sharon’s government, in the theft of the produce of the land, in the confiscation of profits and in the denial to the people of the means of their existence and their very survival. The 1995 agreement followed closely on the heels of the Oslo process. It was designed to be a contribution to the peace process. The situation today is totally different. What type of cooperation can we be talking about?

 Mr President, I will first of all give my enthusiastic support to the report by my colleague Mr Modrow, in which, to their credit, the two Commission Communications open up the debate on the position, role and responsibilities of State-owned and private enterprises in developing countries. According to Mr Modrow, the report has the virtue of pointing out the contradictions, and sometimes even the inconsistencies, in the European policy. The Union is not actually impartial on the issue of strengthening or not strengthening State-owned sectors in countries with which it has close relations. Unfortunately, it too often advocates a policy of reducing public costs and deficits in response to the structural adjustment measures dear to international financial institutions, a policy which, in its wording, admittedly seeks to reduce poverty but which in reality can end up being to the total detriment of the peoples concerned. In this way, the incentives and pressures exerted on these countries with a view to privatising their economies has a price, and this is a high price to be paid by the men and women in these countries, a high price for the employees concerned, there as here. There is a chronic lack of connection between economic and financial objectives, and the need to satisfy, above all else, the needs and fundamental rights of these peoples. In this framework, the often too exclusive call on the private sector is at best a deception and at worst a seizure of economic, social and political power, which slips from the control of the peoples in these countries. We are aware of the drastic social consequences of this. If this is not the case, why then does the Commission always refuse to carry out a transparent, public and openly debated assessment of the effect of liberalisation on employment, on the quality and the extent of the services provided and on working conditions in Europe itself? Yet, such an assessment would render more credible its call for the European Union’s experience on this matter to be considered. If combining a strong and modern State-owned sector and private enterprises could be desirable to meet needs, in particular in the services area, it is nonetheless a fact that the call for public-private partnerships at present actually does more to weaken public enterprises than to create an overall dynamic. Faced with the jungle of competition, the safeguards – when there are any – that are meant to maintain, strengthen and modernise services of State-owned enterprises are not enough. Without employees being involved in decisions and the destiny of the enterprise, without consulting the peoples and without a genuine code of practice which restricts multinationals involved in developing countries, recourse to private investments amounts to financial takeovers by large corporations, without there being any improvement to the service and often to the detriment of the national interests of these countries. The ever more dominant role of these transnational companies in the world clearly benefits the financial, speculative and stock market system more than the people of the South. I am, furthermore, surprised that the Commission is furthering privatisation as a means to fight corruption. In this regard, a great deal of experience in Europe and throughout the world far from verifies these assertions. The EU should strengthen its aid to the developing countries according to the criteria of whether enterprises are modernising by moving towards democratisation in decision-making processes, with more transparency in the operation of public service enterprises. Finally, and I will conclude on this point, the fundamental rights of every person to health and education must remain in the public sphere, just as water, transport, health and energy should remain outside of the GATS.

 Yes to a more active role for the EU within the UN, as recommended by the report. ‘Multilateralism (which) remains the best way to achieve global peace and security’, is indeed one way of guaranteeing that we avoid the supremacy of one superpower. But the objectives that are set out disregard reality and current dangers. Declarations of intent are no longer enough: poverty eradication, human development, conflict prevention and peacekeeping all require a degree of financial and political investment that is equal to these challenges. Following the armed intervention and occupation of Iraq by the United States and the suppression – to the point of extinction? – of the Palestinian people, the spirit that prevailed when the United Nations was created and the principles underlying the Charter are more than ever being ridden over roughshod and even trampled underfoot by certain countries. Now more than ever we need to defend international law and champion the right of nations to self-determination with renewed vigour and that means taking action. The United Nations peace plan for Western Sahara, for example, including holding a referendum on self-determination, must be implemented, regardless of any further shilly-shallying by the Moroccan Government. Proper sanctions must also be applied in cases where human rights are violated or the environment is damaged.

The subject is much debated, in as much as the very neoliberal tendencies of NEPAD raise legitimate questions among all those who dream of finally seeing Africa emerge from under-development. I also support the criticisms made by the report, particularly with regard to the absence of democratic consultation of ‘civil society’, of unions and even of national parliaments. Conducting an independent study on NEPAD’s impact on social rights, food safety, access to raw materials and protection of the environment is undoubtedly the greatest encouragement to emerge. The fact remains that the responsibilities of the EU and of the G8 must not be relinquished, whether this means it is necessary to cancel the debt – which continues to drastically and unjustly suffocate budgets – or a reform and increase of public aid for development. It is estimated that 64 billion dollars are required per year to achieve the goals set by NEPAD. Fund providers must face up to their responsibilities. Welcoming the Heads of State that established NEPAD to the G8 with great pomp is one thing, backing up words with actions is quite another. Finally, the drafting of a legally restrictive framework accompanied by sanctions for businesses that contribute to conflicts would also be appropriate in preventing conflicts that are often murderous.

 Mr President, here at the beginning of 2004 the climate of obsession with security has become more pronounced. The fight against terrorism is now held up to justify any repressive, authoritarian or discriminatory measure. Freedom of expression and freedom of movement, indeed all democratic rights at times, are suffering in many countries, including under George Bush’s administration, which has just established a specific procedure for officials of airline companies from 10 countries to enter American territory. Throughout the world, there are also numerous examples of an offensive against those men and women who campaign tirelessly for human rights. In anticipation of the next session of the United Nations Commission on Human Rights, I would like to mention a few of them. I am thinking of Sihem Bensedrine, a writer, journalist and former spokesperson for the National Council for Liberties in Tunisia, who was attacked in the middle of the street a few days ago in Tunis on her way home. A group of 15 lawyers lodged a complaint on her behalf and Sihem Bensedrine blamed, and I quote, ‘the political police’. As usual, the Tunisian authorities rushed to deny the existence of any such police. The many recent interventions by this courageous and passionate campaigner to denounce breaches of human rights in her country in the European media, before a parliamentary committee in Germany or even when her last book came out have certainly not seemed to please the Ben Ali regime. The harassment suffered every day by Tunisian human rights defenders shows that the Tunisian regime has not made progress, despite the shocking statements to the contrary made by the French President, Mr Chirac, in Tunis in December.  On the contrary, freedoms as fundamental as the freedoms of expression, of opinion, of association and of assembly continue to be violated every day, treating the European Parliament’s repeated requests with disdain. This assessment is also shared by Mrs Hina Jilani, the Special Representative of the United Nations Secretary-General on Human Rights Defenders. In my view, the European institutions, the Council and the Commission, must shilly-shally no longer and must, at the session of the United Nations Commission on Human Rights and in general, assert an unambiguous position regarding this regime and use their influence to demand respect for all freedoms. The credibility of the EU-Tunisia links must measure up to this requirement. We welcome the very recent release of political prisoners in Morocco, and in particular that of the journalist Ali Lmrabet and several Sahrawi prisoners who had been in jail for many years. Their release is proof of the importance of international solidarity. I would like to take the opportunity provided by this debate and by the forthcoming visit by Kofi Annan to Brussels to receive the Sakharov Prize to reiterate demands that have already been stated here but which are still relevant. I would like to talk about the issue of Western Sahara and to call on the governments of the Member States to give their full support to the current efforts of the United Nations. As the deadline has been set for 31 January, there is an urgent need to put pressure on Morocco to accept, as did the Polisario Front so courageously, and to implement without any further delay the UN peace plan, which at last provides for the self-determination of the Sahrawi people through a free and democratic referendum. The Council and the Commission have the resources to help bring this about. Finally, I would like to mention the situation in Palestine. The people of Palestine have had enough. Every gesture of goodwill, like the Geneva peace initiative adopted by Israeli and Palestinian leaders, is immediately scorned, to say the least, by Sharon. Accusations of treason, the circulation of black lists, fatal shootings by the Israeli army in the Occupied Territories and the sentencing of young, refusenik soldiers are just some of the blows to the very idea of peace in the Middle East. The escalation continues to be dangerous and bloody. In this respect, I can only welcome the beginning of the next session of the Court in The Hague, which is due to give a ruling on the legitimacy of the ‘wall of shame’. However, as regards condemning breaches of rights, the United Nations Commission on Human Rights and the European Union must assume their responsibilities.

 Has the Commission taken account of the Cancún Conference? Reading its communication, tabled with a view to a possible relaunch of the negotiations on the Development Agenda that began in 2001, it is difficult to tell! Its supposed ‘flexibility’ on the Singapore issues is just tinkering around the edges; the call for a balance between rights and the market and its avowed intention to adopt more flexible positions in no way weaken neoliberal European policies. Contempt, a lack of self-criticism and a reluctance to question remain at the heart of the Commission’s creed. Faced with Commissioner Lamy’s statements – rubberstamped by the Council – the poorest countries neither wish to sign up to the supposed new proposals nor are they awarding full marks to the policies implemented since Seattle. On the contrary, the people of the South are organising themselves and resisting European ambitions and the WTO. The opening up of trade in services provided for by the GATS and the no less sacrosanct opening of the market – put forward as a clear benefit for developing countries! – have been clearly identified as dangers by the countries of the South. International relations, which are based on cooperation and trade between equals and are respectful of individual and collective fundamental rights, deserve better. A public debate, relayed by elected representatives, to show the fallacy of this way of thinking is now unavoidable.

The 2004 Budget for an enlarged Europe is less than 1% of gross national income, the lowest since 1997. Commitments are decreasing; payments are decreasing. Structural funds, such as agricultural expenditure, are similarly decreasing. Funds from Heading 4 allocated to foreign aid have been reduced to a bare minimum: aid to Latin America has also been cut by EUR 35 million. There is great financial pressure on essential elements of EU policy, such as human rights or the duty to provide help to the most needy. Funds for development aid have been similarly hit by measures of devastating severity. In such conditions, how can we seriously believe that poverty will be eradicated by 2015? As for the question of funds for Iraq, it is not only a matter of finance. The occupation must end immediately. The Iraqi people need to recover their sovereignty as quickly as possible so that they themselves can identify their needs and arrange the means to satisfy those needs. Recourse to the flexibility instrument will release EUR 95 million. The solution proposed – to reduce funds from Heading 4 – is unacceptable. This Budget does not meet the challenges that the EU must meet today for a fairer, more caring world.

Mr President, it is first of all impossible to ignore the Israeli-Palestinian conflict, since it is dramatic for their populations, and also prevents any development of the Euromed partnership. Only a fair and lasting solution can allow peace to be established in the region. Only an end to the Israeli military occupation, the destruction of the wall of shame and the creation of the Palestinian State beside the Israeli State, will lead to peace and put an end to the unbearable and murderous chain of events suffered by the occupied Palestinian population as well as the Israeli citizens. A glimmer of hope has been offered by the so-called Geneva accords, negotiated over more than two years by the delegations led by Yossi Beilin and Yasser Abed Rabbo. It would be appropriate for the Foreign Ministers meeting in Naples to offer their support for this plan which demonstrates that there are interlocutors on both sides seeking a fair peace, in contrast to what the politicians, in particular the Sharon Government, ceaselessly demonstrate. The Euro-Mediterranean framework may be a valuable asset in terms of contributing to the establishment of a climate of trust allowing genuine dialogue. A first signal would consist of high-level delegations from both the Union and from the Arab countries in particular attending the official signing of these agreements on 1 December in Geneva, on the very eve of the ministerial conference. Another undeniable sign would be for the Union to apply all its efforts to persuading the Quartet to support this initiative as well. With regard to the conference’s tasks in general, the fact that Europe is concerning itself with its future neighbours, particularly in the south, is a good thing, as is the announcement of a Foundation for dialogue between cultures, the creation of which still depends on the allocation of financial resources. Nevertheless, the orientations proposed by the Commission in its preparatory communication are still worrying. It is not certain that the new neighbourhood policy is sufficient to instil ‘a new dynamism into the Barcelona process’, since the approach of simply integrating these countries into the great European market means imposing liberal formulae on them, without taking account of their specific characteristics or the serious economic and social problems they are facing. Since this model is being increasingly criticised, and since even the French proposals for a relaunch of the partnership mention ‘consequences which could have a serious destabilising effect’, the Commission is not challenged at any point. Without taking account of the impact study of the free trade area which it itself has launched, it is moving in the opposite direction by enhancing the reciprocal liberalisation of agricultural and service exchanges. As for the call to turn to the private sector, it still falls far short of the needs of the Mediterranean countries. This short-term thinking is extremely dangerous. All of this means that we need joint construction in the Mediterranean, otherwise the almost constant stigmatisation and humiliation which the Arab-Muslim world, in particular, is subjected to, in addition to inequalities, can only feed religious fundamentalism or the use of terrorism by increasingly dangerous groups. I will end with two further challenges: we must put an end to the obsession with security and establish freedom of movement. With regard to human rights, we should establish genuine specific mechanisms. I would like to express my solidarity with Radhia Nasraoui, the Tunisian lawyer, who has just begun a new hunger strike.

 Certainly, words like ‘new impetus’ declare the ambition of having closer relations. There is talk of a ‘Common Space’, but with no common construction. We are, indeed, a long way from such a space, listening to Mr Prodi talk about political rapprochement
 and progressive integration into the economic and social structures of the European Union. The question may be asked as to whether the word ‘neighbourhood’ has not replaced that of ‘partnership’. The EU’s objective is the integration, pure and simple, of these countries into the sizeable European market, but without any financial compensation in terms of the aid from which the candidate countries for accession benefited, even if the conditions were drastic and unjust. Another aspect is that the Commission’s entire communication is characterised by a very security-minded approach to relations. This is far from the hope of an EU open to the world. Freedom of movement for goods and capital, but not for people, is not only inhumane but also totally illusory and cynical. If the EU wishes to respond to the expectations that continue to be placed upon it by many peoples and to establish a notion of the world radically different from that of the United States, there is every reason for forging new links with our neighbours, particularly our Mediterranean ones.

 A universal moratorium is called for here on a regular basis, but when will this actually be implemented? Good will on the part of Europe is no longer enough. Abolishing the death penalty must be seen as a crucial aspect of the EU’s relations with third countries. Throughout the world countries continue to perpetrate this State crime. This barbaric practice still takes place in particular in Japan, China, the United States, Saudi Arabia, and in Iran, where executions are still carried out. What is worse, between 2001 and 2002, the number of executions increased. It has become impossible to remain silent about this ‘administrative murder’, especially when it is carried out by the most powerful country in the world, which is attempting to impose its order and its values on the rest of the world. We cannot accept that the only solution to crime and violence is crime and violence itself. Like the newly created World Association of Parliamentarians against the Death Penalty and in line with the worldwide call for abolition, the European Union must exert all necessary pressure to ensure that the United Nations adopts a moratorium that would have lead rapidly to the abolition of the death penalty. Men and women are left to rot on death row and Mumia Abu-Jamal is one of these. Preventing the irreparable must be done as a matter of urgency.

 Mr President, the 2004 budget will be the first budget for the enlarged Europe. It is a good opportunity to welcome the ten new Member States, even if it remains the case that the drastic conditions of membership have imposed shock treatment upon their populations. I wish, however, to stick to one question at the present time: is this budget equal to the challenges that the EU should now be taking up in the interests of a fairer world, characterised by greater solidarity? It is permitted to have doubts and worries. I am thinking in the very first place of Palestine. What is Europe’s ambition faced with the deterioration in the conditions of life in the occupied Palestinian territories and with the extent of the destruction of the basic infrastructure, in particular that funded by Europe? One amendment by my group therefore requests the Commission to assess the growing needs of the Palestinian population and to create a specific budget line for the reconstruction and rehabilitation of the territories administered by the National Palestinian Authority. That, I think, would be a strong political signal at a time when Sharon’s policy is aimed, above all, at delegitimising the claims to a Palestinian state, without which, however, no peace will be possible. In the same spirit, my group is pleased about the introduction of an amendment by the Committee on Development and Cooperation, designed to guarantee aid to the people of the Western Sahara and to make sure that it is not interrupted. Aid to Iraq will constitute one of the important points of the budget. The issue of credits for the country’s reconstruction enables us, once again, to send out a strong political signal. Is the basic problem, however, that of the amount of the aid, whether it be EUR 200 million or EUR 500 million? I do not think so. The urgent issue is to put an end to the occupation. Political aid, enabling the Iraqi people to recover their sovereignty and freedom of action as quickly as possible, is a prerequisite of their being able themselves to put figures to their needs and to organise the means for satisfying them. Let us not in fact be fooled by the hidden face of American aid which, for its part, is in any case calculated in billions. The Bush administration’s desire is, firstly, to open the door to the US enterprises that, as announced at a recent meeting, are already poised to do business in Iraq. It certainly intends fully to exploit the legislation that at present authorises foreign companies to acquire 100% of the shares in the various sectors of the Iraqi economy. Is that the way in which it will be possible to satisfy the country’s huge needs? In saying that, I am thinking of the whole range of collective services, from the water supply to electricity, taking in education, social services and health. I do not think that is the way. The idea that the funds should be administered by the American Federal Reserve therefore remains unacceptable. The Commissioner speaks of the need to improve security in Iraq. As long, however, as the sovereignty of the Iraqi people is scorned, none of the problems will be resolved. The vote on the last resolution, 1511, of the Security Council witnesses to a symbolic Franco-German climb-down on this subject, symbolic of European nervousness in the face of American pressure. The EU would, however, benefit by speaking up more clearly in favour of strict respect for the interests of the Iraqi people, so that they might regain their dignity as quickly as possible, and in favour, at a budgetary level, of a multilateral fund of special allocations in which the United Nations would finally have its rightful place. In this connection, the voice of the Iraqis needs to be heard. The Iraqi people must, as quickly as possible, play a part in the reconstruction and democratisation of their country. Europe would benefit from being a partner in the process and a party to it.

The developing countries are organising and asserting themselves. The main lesson of Cancún is linked to the rising power of the Southern ‘bloc’. The poor countries have had enough of putting up with the arrogance of the world trade giants, the United States and the European Union. Even though Mr Pascal Lamy is doing his best to make believe that the failure of the conference is, first and foremost, detrimental to the poor countries, the fact remains that – for lack of the WTO fortress – a protectorate has fallen. We have to get away from the cynicism of the ‘tit for tat’ logic which consists of imposing on the South the profligacy of all-out liberalisation of their most vital sectors, while its people are struggling to survive. The Union and the Member States should construct new relations with the South, not despoil it. Europe should refuse to toe the United States' line, by leaning, for example, on the authority acquired by the anti-globalisation movement. Today, isolated, discredited in its will to invest sincerely in a real cooperation and development policy, the Union needs to pull itself together. The so-called ‘poor’ countries are not poor in terms of demands and proposals. It is by considering them as real counterparts that Europe will win a place in the world, in order to help make it more humane.

 Mr President, the solemn calls for budgetary rigour and discipline entail devastating constraints when it comes to development aid. The promises remain, but there is a difficulty in getting actions to follow. That, in the end, is the thought inspired in me by this 2004 budget on development cooperation. I agree, on this matter, with our rapporteur, Mrs Sanders-Ten Holte, that any subordination to the external actions heading cannot but accentuate this phenomenon. Indeed, how is one to believe that the objective of eradicating poverty between now and 2015 will be achieved when – and this is only one example – the financial commitments to the Middle Eastern, Latin American, Asian and ACP countries that are the concern of the OECD’s Development Assistance Committee 
have not been honoured by the Commission, particularly when it comes to the health and education sectors? One is permitted to have doubts. The sums allocated still offer very little basis for fulfilling the declared wish of achieving the millennium objectives. How can approval not be given to any demand made of the Commission to give attention also to the rights of the most vulnerable people and to provide for a specific budgetary line when necessary? I am thinking, for example, of the rights of children. Any reduction in, or financial pressure upon, the fundamental elements of Community policy, such as human rights or the duty to give assistance to those who are weakest, would have the effect of sending out a very negative signal indeed to peoples already largely excluded from the march of world progress – victims, no more nor less, of a globalisation that has more in common with the law of the jungle than with growth and the equitable distribution of wealth. Developing countries are waiting for the European Union’s ambitions to change, a fact witnessed to, I think, by the reactions at the last WTO conference in Cancún. As a final word on the subject of development aid, I remain convinced that, without a serious review of the financial perspectives, the pressure upon this heading will become unbearable. As for the proposals concerning reconstruction in Iraq, they also call, at any rate in the long term, for an increase in overall resources to avoid the need to draw on the reduced sums for development aid. That being said, I agree with Mr Poos: the announcement of such a financial commitment cannot in any case precede Europe’s indispensable adoption of an independent policy in favour of the sovereignty of the Iraqi people and of the role of the UN. Regarding the amendments, I approve of those that could favour an annual evaluation of the results and anticipate a joint dialogue between the Commission, Parliament and the Council on the methods to be put in place in order to achieve the objectives. In the same spirit and in the interests of genuinely democratic and effective development cooperation, I am in favour of encouraging the widest participation, at all levels, of all those active in civil society. Finally, I am going to support my group’s proposal aimed at creating a specific line of aid for the rehabilitation and reconstruction of the territories under the administration of the Palestinian Authority. The Israeli army’s destruction, to the tune of almost EUR 40 million, of the infrastructure funded by the EU or the Member States was the product of criminal fury. The Palestinian population’s conditions of life have deteriorated considerably during the most recent period. We know that the Commission’s delegation on the ground is doing a remarkable job in difficult conditions. If, however, the EU is to be an active member of the quartet in the manner suggested by the speeches, the EU would do well to accord its budgetary lines as it intends.

Mr President, last July I tabled an oral question to the Commission on renewing the scientific and technical cooperation agreement with Israel. In substance the reply said that the Commission believed that the development of relations with Israel would make a significant contribution to the Middle East peace process. You have said more or less the same thing to us today, Mr Nielson. Although I share the idea that knowledge and an exchange of knowledge help build a better world, in the same ways as economic cooperation, I am particularly stupefied by this answer. Indeed, this position completely disregards the Parliament’s Resolution of April 2002, of which it is obviously right to remind you here given the general title of the debate. We all know that in paragraph 8 of the Resolution, Parliament asked the Council and the Commission to urgently convene the association council to give its position to the Israeli Government, by asking the latter to respect the UN resolutions, and, in this context, called for the suspension of the Association Agreement. Where are we, a year and a half after this demand was worded? When the Agreement began in 1995, just after the process in Oslo, some regarded it as helping to build peace. The situation now, however, is radically different. What type of cooperation is the Commission talking about? Partnerships can only be devised on the basis of mutual trust, and of shared rights and obligations. Now, the criminal attitude of the Israeli Government shows every day that it not only flouts the concerns of the Union, but also that it outbids the other in this fatal situation. More than a year ago now, Israel erected a wall in the West Bank allegedly for reasons of safety. In actual fact, it is an iron curtain that massacres the Palestinian territories and drives tens of thousands of inhabitants in their homes. In this way, new territories are being annexed. It is time to give Parliaments’ Resolution tangible form. There are precedents. In 1990 the Commission enforced Parliament’s recommendation that scientific cooperation be partially frozen until the Palestinian schools and universities that had been closed unilaterally by the Israeli authorities were completely reopened and remained so. It was at least a few months before it was possible for them to reopen. Today, given that the clause on the respect of fundamental rights has been brutally violated, and in the sight of the whole world, in what way is this demand for suspension excessive? In what way is it excessive to ask that this law is applied and respected? Finally, and I conclude Mr President, I am aware that the responsibility of the Council, shamefully absent today, is enormous. As, in theory, a member of the quartet, the Union has the means to carry weight. What it lacks is the political will to do so.

 It is now more than three months since Aung San Suu Kyi, Nobel Peace Prize winner and Sakharov Prize winner, was – to put it purely and simply – kidnapped by the Burmese junta, who have been holding her in detention ever since. The UN emissaries and the representatives of the Red Cross have not been able to visit her regularly. Last July a delegation from the International Committee of the Red Cross was probably the last contact that Aung San Suu Kyi had with the outside world. No one has seen her since. Today, in the same way that the dictator denied secretly holding the young woman, the Burmese authorities are denying her hunger strike, made public on 31 August by the US State Department. The imprisonment and arrest of militants of the National League for Democracy in May quite rightly gave rise to much feeling in the world. The US took the opportunity to reinforce their economic sanctions on the Rangoon regime. Today, the – no doubt demagogic – use of this announcement by the US cannot, however, hide the severity of the regime nor its hypocrisy in promising an official roadmap destined to restore democracy. This programme, which includes, and I quote, ‘free and fair elections and a new Constitution’, still does not fix a timetable and remains silent on the release of the leader of the opposition. It happened after the junta showed its desire to not respect any of the democratic demands of its people, and this is a bad omen. The results of the 1990 elections which, let us remember, were a landslide victory for Aung San Suu Kyi’s party, were not recognised by the armed forces. The Association of South-East Asian Nations now threatens to exclude Burma from its members. It had hoped for the release of Aung San Suu Kyi before its next summit in Bali in October. As for the European Union, it should do everything possible to compel the military junta to free the Nobel Prize winner. In collaboration with the United Nations, the Council and the Commission should now show their determination, through strict sanctions, to do something practical in the process of democratisation in Burma. Political pressure should increase. Under the rule of one of the fiercest dictators, in the hands of a head of government who has held the duties of head of services of the military information for forty years, the Burmese people need all our solidarity. The worry such as that for the lady of Rangoon is a genuine one. Let us listen to the opposition, which has just declared that this hunger strike is a declaration that the Burmese generals are slowly but surely poisoning her.

The report rightly condemns the human rights situation in many countries. However, it is unfortunate that the Maghreb countries as well as Israel are strangely absent. Indeed, 2002 marked a worrying, repressive turning point in those countries, particularly with regard to freedom of expression: detention of and judicial proceedings against leaders of the Kabylie citizens’ movement in Algeria and now attacks on the freedom of the press; imprisonment of an Internet journalist in Tunisia; censorship and the charging of journalist Ali Lmrabet in Morocco; and attacks carried out by the Moroccan authorities in Western Sahara. In the West Bank, the building of the wall of shame represents serious infringement of the Palestinian people’s right to move freely and right to land; it poses a threat to human rights and to peace. Finally, in many countries, the supposed fight against terrorism provides an excuse for security and repressive measures. This must be resisted. Moreover, it is up to us to ensure that the calling into question of international law, which has been dangerously trivialised by the American authorities, does not lead to a world where economic and political interests always take priority over the rights of individuals and peoples.

Commissioner, a few days before the last European Union/United States summit, you expressed your satisfaction that there were, and I quote, ‘solid commercial relations between the Union and the United States that enable us to work together on the Doha programme.’ However, just before Cancun, it is vital that there is a European commitment that is not afraid of being different from the American positions in several areas. This is what I think is expected by those, such as the trade ministers of the LDCs very recently, who are criticising the WTO’s inability to respect the Doha timetable, to complete the negotiations on decisions in favour of development, on access to medicines, special and differential treatment or trade in agricultural products. So far, no progress has been made. I would like to reiterate my fear of this ‘dimension’ of development disappearing due to a policy that gives priority only to commercial trade and has been dogmatic in choosing to liberalise it. While the gulf between rich and poor countries is widening, it is difficult to accept this desire to include new subjects such as investment, competition or public markets. For its part, GATS threatens public services and State missions when there has not yet been any evaluation of what effect liberalisation may have. Under these circumstances, there should be a moratorium. The right to health, education, food safety, and energy should prevail above commercial interests. The European Union should, on the contrary, work towards the democratisation of the international trade system and cooperate closely with developing countries so that the development objectives prevail.

 Mr President, I, too, would like to congratulate Mr Wijkman and thank him for being so open to dialogue and willing to listen to the amendments put forward in the Committee on Development and Cooperation. The Johannesburg Summit rightly affirmed that access to energy for the poor has become a priority, since it is so very true that the populations’ vital needs in this respect are far from being satisfied and the trend is still away from equality; the main reason for this is the developed countries’ fossil fuel consumption, in particular US consumption, which is excessive and very much out of proportion to that of the developing countries. Life expectancy and development are closely linked to access to energy, to the point that many see it as a real basic human right. That right must be recognised, guaranteed and protected. How can we contribute to the existence and development of an efficient energy sector in the developing countries without policies that encourage close cooperation for the exchange of know-how, the primary objective being to meet the vital needs of the populations? The need for finance is evident. The creation of a Sustainable Energy Fund and much more consistent participation by the European Union could be a first response. In particular, as the report rightly says, the existence of a strong public sector in the energy sector is particularly important in the first phase of development. More than that, as the majority of the Committee on Development and Cooperation has said, I remain convinced that the Commission’s options for privatisation of the energy sector are more than dangerous. The Commission’s role is not to promote privatisation in the developing countries. The exploitation and distribution of primary energy, which is essential for development, must be handled by public or private companies committed to public service and general interest goals. Such public control is all the more vital because the trans-national corporations that operate in the developing countries are all too often concerned only with short-term profitability, to the detriment of the needs of the local populations and at the risk of plundering their energy resources. Effective machinery must be deployed to monitor the activities of European undertakings in particular. I also support the call on the Commission to review deregulation of the energy sector from a human development perspective and to work towards international trade norms which abide by human rights and peoples' rights. Finally, seeing that next September’s WTO Summit in Cancun is not far away, we must refuse to allow the energy sector to be included in the general agreement on trade in services, which would make energy a commodity like any other. The aim of universal access to energy in the service of development will not be achieved by following a model imposed by the liberal thinking of multilateral bodies like the WTO, but by expanding and guaranteeing the public service to meet the needs of the populations.

 Mr President, I would just like to add a word to the same effect. First to thank the Commissioner because I think holding debates in which ideas can contend is the way to make progress. That is what happened in the Committee on Development and Cooperation. Not everyone was in agreement with all the points in the report, but that does not prevent me from wanting the debate to continue, because it must exist. I mentioned just now the general agreement on trade in services, for example. The debate on this subject is public, it exists. I want it to continue. Like Mrs Sauquillo, I also want to thank the Commissioner for what she said about the Commission’s commitment to greater funding. The needs are in fact so great I think we can agree together to be generous in this.

 Madam President, just hours after the Evian G8 meeting, which a growing number of citizens see as illegitimate, I feel it is essential to come up with answers to a number of questions, before attempting to consider the nature of the transatlantic partnership. As I do not have a great deal of time, I will only touch on some of these questions. First, there is the question of Iraq. Can we really say that the issue of the war has been dealt with when the European Union has given its blessing to the United States having complete control of Iraq? Should we engage in a war against terrorism instigated by the bellicose stance of the United States that seeks to dominate, not to share power? This is just increasing the threat. Should we then allow ourselves to be engulfed in a genuine currency war, started this time by the United States? Should we give in to President Bush’s decrees yet again by setting aside what remains of the European social model? Should we set aside the provisions on retirement, for example, in the face of wholesale opposition as exemplified by the large demonstrations in France and Austria? Lastly, what use will the meeting of the WTO in Cancun be if the European Union does not stand up to the United States’ continuing failure to move on certain issues, especially that of allowing poor countries to access generic medicines? The European Union is at a crossroads. It may choose to hide behind the strategic doctrine entitled ‘for a new American century’. Alternatively it may choose to adopt a truly independent policy. If we choose the latter, how can we achieve such a policy without addressing the huge expectations of the southern hemisphere and without freeing ourselves from the ultraliberal policy that exacerbates inequalities and frustrates all attempts to promote development? We must listen to the people of Europe. They do not want Europe to be a poor relation of the United States. They do not want Europe to be overcautious. They are hoping and praying for an independent and responsible Europe. They long for a Europe that promotes the interests of all in working for a world that is safer because it is more humane.

 A trade strategy reflects a particular view of the world: a pure liberalisation of trade exacerbating inequality or a fight for real development? As the Mann report again shows, the chief aim of creating regional free trade areas (FTAs) is to ensure the EU has political and economic stability in its relations with the countries concerned (the ‘strategic geo-political interests’) so that nothing can get in the way of the sacrosanct free movement of goods, services and capital. But what of peoples’ access to basic rights? What about an assessment of the social, environmental, cultural and economic consequences of such liberalisation? What about genuine cooperation on equal terms and respecting the distinctive nature of each partner? WTO rules must not be allowed to interfere with the EU’s – still privileged – relations with its partners. The EU cannot reduce its policy towards countries and whole regions to free trade areas alone; there is too much of that in the Mediterranean, for example, while what is urgently needed is real political dialogue and economic and social cooperation built without any concept of domination.

 – Mr President, the historic enlargement of the Union and, perhaps to an even greater extent, the new situation created by the occupation of Iraq and the imperialist pretensions of the United States, mean that we need to think about the role the European Union wishes to play in the future and, in particular, its role with regard to its future neighbours. This is urgent. The logic of force is persisting after the war. By helping itself to the resources and monopolising all of the levers of power, the Bush administration is continuing to both impose the fait accompli
 against the interests of the Iraqi people and disregard the UN and thus respect for international law. To line up another view of the world against this veritable doctrine, the European Union now needs political courage, initiative and dialogue. In my view, forging new relations with our future neighbours could be a first decisive step, particularly as regards the Arab Muslim world. The virtually constant condemnation and humiliation it is suffering, combined with the economic and social gap, can only serve to fuel religious fundamentalism and the use of terrorism by increasingly dangerous groups, as a result of which the extreme right here hopes to prosper. To combat all of these perils effectively, I feel that priority should be given to objectives and means other than those set out in the Commission communication. There is no doubt that, in theory, as regards the idea of new momentum, for example, there is the goal of closer relations. However, there will be no common area without common construction. We are far from that, listening to Romano Prodi talk about political rapprochement
 and gradual integration into the European Union’s economic and social structures. Would the word ‘neighbours’ then be replaced with the word ‘partnership’? Does the composition of the enlarged meeting of 40 European countries, held in Athens on 17 April, which you have discussed, prefigure a type of multi-speed integration, with second-zone countries, the so-called Wider Europe, and others in a third zone, the southern Mediterranean countries? Above all, however, mere alignment with the market approach that governs the current process of European integration does little to meet our needs or achieve any effectiveness in this area. A genuine cooperation policy cannot equate to the sacrosanct transposition of the Community acquis
, because that is what we are talking about, especially when no equivalent is mentioned as regards aid. The initiative of launching specific action programmes may be interesting given the rigidity, for example, of the overall Barcelona process. Nevertheless, while the negotiations conducted with the candidate countries have left a bitter taste in the mouth and resulted in a great deal of frustration, as we are quite aware, the Commission has not proposed any review of the matter. What is worse, a bonus is offered for the best reform students. As regards the conflicts, and I am ending now, the Commission has spent very little time on this aspect although a common area can only be built on the principle of international law and on a much more active role for the Union. Finally, the fact that the entire Commission document focuses almost exclusively on the security aspect of relations… (The President cut off the speaker)

 Mr President, Leila Zana, winner of the Sakharov prize, at a time when her case is being reviewed due to the judgment of the European Court of Human Rights, has just called on the European Union to encourage reform by instigating accession negotiations with Turkey without delay. She claimed that this would speed up the democratisation process in Turkey. Indeed, when will the Turkish powers finally embark on that path instead of continuing to harass democratic militants, as was still the case with the arbitrary requisitioning of the premises of the Turkish Human Rights Association, an association which already suffers frequent threats and intimidation? The recent ban last March of the ADEP party is also unacceptable, given that this party clearly rejects any link with armed combat. The Constitutional Court of Ankara is thus adding to the very long list of penalties imposed on those who fight for the recognition of the Kurdish people’s rights. The Turkish powers are keeping rigidly to a way of thinking which not only harms the direct victims of oppression but also Turkish society as a whole and the image of the country abroad. Almost exactly a year ago, on 10 May 2002, the ad hoc
 delegation from Parliament considered that the ban on the ADEP would constitute a substantial step backwards for Turkish democracy. Sadly, that is now the case. What conclusions can we draw from this? We must avoid falling into the trap of the conservatives and other extremists here in Europe, who automatically exclude the Turkish people from the Christian club that the European Union would be. It would be criminal to stigmatise and isolate this nation by closing the doors to the Union in its face. That is why I would like to reiterate here my full support for the activities of those in Turkey who are demonstrating in favour of human rights, sometimes risking their lives. The democratic forces need to know that we are by their side to ensure that the day when it is possible to live and speak freely in Turkey comes as soon as possible. The Council and the Commission therefore need to make a greater effort to ensure that the Turkish Government observes the Copenhagen criteria, in other words, that it promotes human rights and the rule of law. This commitment should be shown by commensurate financial support for the activities of associations working for democracy. Lastly, following the reopening of the Leila Zana case and those of three of her colleagues a few days ago, I would like to express my hope that the European Parliament will be able to present Mrs Zana with her prize here in this hemicycle as soon as possible.

 President-in-Office of the Council, I should like to thank you for your replies, in particular the one concerning the self-determination of the Saharawi people, a question which is finally being examined now, although I had asked a question on this subject during the last session. In my last written question, I expressed great concern over the fact that the Council had not followed up this point. On the other hand, I am a little worried about the effect of your overall reply, because you said, amongst other things, that it was for the parties involved to show common sense. How does that position show respect for international legitimacy? Surely it is up to the European Union to play an important role here, particularly with regard to its partners. I am thinking in particular, of course, of Morocco, with which we have signed an association agreement. In my opinion, it would be advisable for the European Union to have a frank and critical dialogue with our partner. The association agreement which we signed with Morocco contains a very precisely worded Article 2 which is concerned with respect for human rights in Western Sahara. I would simply like to repeat my previous two questions. Does the European Council intend to react to the acts of harassment, in particular the measures taken to dismiss several Saharawi representatives who met an ad hoc delegation from the European Parliament over a year ago? Does the Council intend to protest against the ten-year prison sentences handed down to three Saharawis in March? Do these questions not fall within the scope of respect for human rights and Article 2 of the association agreement with Morocco?

 Mr President, Mrs Cerdeira Morterero’s report is attempting to make positive adjustments to the Commission’s initial proposal, in a climate characterised by security laws and the de facto
 criminalisation of emigration. This is the case, for example, with regard to the ending of discrimination in the field of family reunification. But we might ask ourselves whether it is not a question of a fool’s bargain, as asserted by certain fellow Members, since the Council already reached an agreement in February, with which Commissioner Vitorino was satisfied. Therefore allow me, in turn, to express doubts over the desire to take the opinion of the European Parliament into account. Allow me also to express extreme concern over the current trend where several countries of the Union are hardening their migration policies. For example, we understand why the French Government called this agreement – an important part of the policy on the control of migration flows. While harmonisation of national laws is necessary, is this taking place based on compliance with the rights and protection of third-country nationals, in the very spirit of the Tampere agreements, or will the transposal of this directive on the contrary be the pretext, for some, for a reduction in the level of protection already guaranteed by the Member States? By increasing the conditions of entry, for example, for children and choosing between qualified and non-qualified job-seekers, Europe is becoming a fortress. This policy plays no part in creating a European citizenship which upholds the values of tolerance, democracy and solidarity in accordance with, in particular, the Geneva Convention and the Universal Declaration of Human Rights. This is a real opportunity for the Union: immigrant populations should instead take advantage of free movement and a welcome which enables them to participate in local life and have a reasonable income. We would be a long way from the fantasy of invaders in that case. In this respect, the 2002 report on the Continuous Reporting System on Migration set up by the OECD re-establishes the truth. In France, whether the Minister of the Interior likes it or not, the total number of permanent entries totalled 119 000 people in 2002, that is, less than the figure for 1998, and the principal reason for this migration remains, in 77% of cases, family reunification. Lastly, following the example of human rights associations, I am today anxious to condemn actions which the Danish Presidency in a way allowed in its Return Action Programme of November 2002. I refer to chartering flights which are loaded with ‘undesirables’. It will have taken barely four months for Mr Sarkozy in France to disappear into this organisation of forced returns, shameful for this day and age, and above all, a far cry from a humane and fair immigration policy.

While stressing the importance of respecting the provisions of the Stability Pact and stepping up the reforms adopted in Lisbon, the García-Margallo report remains deaf to the criticisms and strong disagreements that are being heard increasingly loudly from public opinion. It remains blind to the increase in unemployment, mass redundancies and sudden closures of companies. What crime have the employees of Metaleurope committed? What sort of ‘stability’ are we talking about when lives are shattered for the sake of being ‘consistent with monetary policy’? We always hear the same old thing: liberalisation of the markets requires sacrifices! Instead of this, I would have liked the EU to aim for a genuine pact for employment and growth, based on satisfying the needs of the people, increasing salaries, a real policy to create jobs and wealth. I can therefore only oppose the report’s approach of ‘not calling into question macro-economic stability’, which means that employers receive public funds and can shut companies down, without being accountable for it. I cannot support the invitation to ‘further liberalise services of general interest (...) namely postal services, telecommunications, gas and electricity, rail and air transport, and broadcasting’.

 Despite all these fine words, the European Parliament remains under-informed and, above all, under-consulted. We are unable to exercise parliamentary control. What value do meetings involving confidential documents held behind closed doors have? How can we accept this lack of democratic debate where neither national parliaments nor the European Parliament are involved? The Commission is relying on a general mandate pre-dating Seattle that has been rendered null and void. It therefore has no legitimate right to impose its decisions. Through aggressive demands directed at third countries, concerning the water sector, in particular, the Commission is undermining any genuine efforts to address the needs of the people of the countries involved. Other values must be promoted over the profits of multinationals, trade for its own sake and the rationale of privatisation: particularly the need for strong public services, which are essential to social cohesion and equality. We must ask ourselves why it is so difficult to assess the consequences of liberalisation. Modernity lies in the ability of governments to guarantee fundamental rights and not in a determination to satisfy the financial markets. I join with more than 150 other French elected representatives in demanding transparency and the suspension of the negotiations in order to prevent an irreversible GATS.

 Mr President, I should like to take advantage of this annual debate to express my concern about the obstacles to freedom of movement and, more generally, the immigration-policy restrictions in the Union. It has to be admitted that the call to combat terrorism is leading to so-called security measures which sometimes interfere with fundamental rights, at the risk of intensifying a trend which already exists. Therefore, although the proposals resulting from the meeting of the Convention working party are worthy of interest, the events of 11 September have been explicitly quoted as justification for a high level of Community control in fields such as cross-border crime, asylum policy or the control of the external borders of the Union, and yet this process of amalgamation has not given rise to any indignation. In France, the so-called 'internal security' bill drawn up by the Minister for Internal Affairs targets a whole range of actions: the illegal installation of travellers, the holding of meetings in the entrance halls of blocks of flats, aggressive begging, so-called 'passive or active' soliciting, explicitly aimed at foreign prostitutes, and all these things constitute offences which attract heavy fines and, in some cases, prison sentences. In other words, what we have here is simply a bill which lumps together immigration, poverty and insecurity. In addition, as far as any immigration and asylum policy is concerned, the current French proposals can be boiled down to the setting up of quotas for tourist visas, the drawing up of a list of so-called safe countries, compulsory repatriation or the creation of a corps of European border guards. However, to impose quotas or talk about managing migratory flows, while at the same time recruiting the brains and muscle power from the South which are useful to the 'European market' is a hypocrisy which in actual fact is helping to conceal the networks of people smugglers, to encourage people to emigrate to a life of wretchedness and exploitation, and even to criminalise migrants to the detriment of a policy based on equal rights and freedom of movement. The Seville Council gave a very bad signal here when it reduced the European approach to immigration to the setting of even stricter conditions for access and residence, and even cashed in on economic aid as a result. Yet how can talking more about policing than about trade, and more about insecurity than about liberty, contribute towards the development revelled in by so many liberal European speeches, without any human exchanges and without movement? The closure of the camp at Sangatte in the north of France is proof, if proof were needed, that the closing of borders does nothing to reduce the distress of men and women who are fleeing persecution, conflict or poverty. The most vulnerable people and ethnic minorities are the ones most severely affected by this repressive policy. I am thinking of the Romany people, whom the European Union is threatening with expulsion and rejecting in practice. I am thinking of the illegal immigrants who, in France, despite their legitimate perseverance in wanting to live there legally, are prevented from doing so by a policy of hindrance, arrest and expulsion. Yet there is so much that needs to be done in order to take initiatives drawn up in a spirit of opening up to the world and welcoming it, for example by contributing towards real cooperation on development, ensuring equality in the social and economic services, in access to employment for everyone, but also in civil rights. I am thinking of the regularisation of the position of illegal immigrants, or the Madrid appeal for residential citizenship, the recognition of voting rights and eligibility for local and European elections. What Europe needs, therefore, is a new immigration policy.

 Mr President, no one can now continue to deny the link between poverty and the lack of any rights with regard to reproduction and sexuality. Nor can anyone continue to plead ignorance regarding the ways in which, in certain countries, women’s rights on these matters are abused. This evening’s debate enables us to demonstrate how urgent it is to make substantial funding available for setting up infrastructures covering the people who are most vulnerable, the provision of information, basic public health care and methods of contraception. The undertakings given at the International Conference on Population and Development held in Cairo should be maintained and honoured. While more than ten million children die each year of curable diseases in developing countries, and while forty million people with HIV-AIDS also live in developing countries, the initiatives of the European Union are even more important when the present situation also features the attempt by the United States – fortunately unsuccessful at the moment – to include in the Plan for Action recently adopted in Bangkok the promotion of fidelity and chastity as the sole means of protecting people against sexually-transmitted diseases (STDs) or AIDS. This debate, and I would like to thank our rapporteur for her work on the subject, has to remain serious. A society which sets up as a model the so-called ideal family cannot be anything other than a moralistic and sectarian society, of which women are always the first victims, with their rights being all too often dependent on the goodwill of men, whether father, husband or brother. What sort of society do they think they are creating, when on the one hand there is the US District of Columbia, which still denounces extra-marital sex as a crime, and on the other there is Nigeria, where women are stoned for the same reason? The emancipation of women and the full development of everyone requires rights and actions. These include the inalienable right of women to have full control of their own bodies, without any constraints, and also to have the freedom to choose when they have a child. As for the right to abortion, it still has to be defended, and for some women, including some in Europe, it still has to be acquired. On this point, having been warned by Polish women’s groups and feminist organisations, I should like to draw the attention of the Commission and of the Council to a real and present threat. The Polish Government is apparently asking now that the Treaty of Accession which it is getting ready to sign with the Union should include a reference to morality, culture and the promotion of life, which would in fact legitimise the current restrictive law on abortion in Poland. Like the sixty percent of the population of that country who are opposed to that law, I would like to associate myself with the appeal launched against the inclusion of any such statement in the Treaty of Accession. The Commission and the Member States would be giving a very bad signal to those people, in particular women, who believe in the values of liberty, dignity and the emancipation of our European societies. Finally, I think the time has finally come to make more funding available for that proportion of development aid which is spent on health and education. That is why I support the amount of funding proposed by Mrs Sandbæk in her report.

 Most of the countries worst affected by AIDS, malaria and tuberculosis are unable to produce the necessary treatments themselves. Forty-two million people are infected with AIDS in the world. Only 36 000 people are receiving treatment in Africa. Every day, 40 000 people die from infectious disease. The situation is therefore serious and urgent. In response to this situation, on 20 December last, the Northern countries gave in to the diktat by the United States which, in order to protect its pharmaceutical industry, vetoed the agreement on generic medicines. The European Union, however, wishing to protect its image, agreed to go back on the Doha acquis, by presenting highly restrictive definitions of the diseases in question and the countries concerned and allowing the establishment of a right for the WHO to assess the conduct of countries in this matter. Hundreds of thousands of human lives are at risk. The European Commission has chosen to give the profits of the pharmaceutical industries precedence over life. Together with my group, I support the many NGOs that are asking for matters relating to public health to fall outside the scope of the WHO.

 Mr President, Commissioner, the integration of the economies of the poorest countries into the world trade system will remain an illusion unless the returns envisaged take into account the difficulties which those countries have in trading and, particularly, in developing. The fight against poverty and food insecurity and the prevention of the conflicts which often result from them must target the structural causes and must break away from economic, agricultural and trade policies which are now bankrupt. The main economic obstacles preventing the food needs of billions of human beings from being met are well known: the obligation to sell at prices that are lower than production costs, the way in which farmers in those countries are more or less forced to concentrate on export products that are useful to the countries of the North rather than necessary to the people of the South, and the liberalisation of trade carried out by international institutions such as the World Bank, the IMF and the WTO, thereby depriving individual countries of the right to define their own policies. The Commission could decide to set about solving these problems. Unfortunately, I am afraid that the method it has chosen is once again not the right one. The UNDP report for 2002 reminds us that if the process continues at the present snail’s pace, it will take more than 130 years to abolish hunger. World hunger requires more than an urgent appeal by rich countries to poor countries, asking them to fall in with the laws laid down by the WTO. When 60% of the people of Zambia need food aid, and when the multinationals, Monsanto and DuPont, control 93% of its seed market between them, more than short-sighted and short-term private investment is needed. When commercial trade worldwide represents 7 000 billion US dollars a year, when financial transactions amount to 1 500 billion US dollars a day, and when the World Bank itself considers it necessary to double world development aid which has reached a ceiling of 50 billion US dollars a year, when is there going to be a useful tax levied on international financial transactions in order to finance that aid? This is where the intervention of the European Union could be useful. The fight against poverty makes it essential for the developing countries to gain the right to fix their own priorities and strategies in order to support sustainable food production by utilising their own natural and human resources and local know-how and investing in the structural transformation of their economies, at the same time receiving legitimate, guaranteed prices. Free-trade agreements concluded between parties which are not on a level playing ground and which are based on the abolition of customs tariffs regardless of the level of development of each party have exacerbated poverty and have had a negative impact on food security. There is an urgent need to encourage the local production of food crops by encouraging access to land, water and biodiversity resources. There is also an urgent need to cancel the debts.

 The Member States and the EU have got into the habit of giving lessons in democracy and defence of human rights all over the world. This generally accompanies demands for freedom of the market and competition. Reading the Swiebel report, you would think the Member States also needed to put their houses in order. The report does in fact reveal many violations of human rights in the EU. No country is spared! Sexual discrimination or discrimination against minorities like the Roma, police violence, deplorable conditions of detention in prisons and police stations, racist, xenophobic and anti-Semitic acts and violence, challenges to basic rights in the name of combating terrorism, the replacement of security policies and crackdowns on immigration and asylum, not to mention violations of social rights and frequent attacks on trade union rights. The report of the Committee on Citizens’ Freedoms and Rights, Justice and Home Affairs is based on a large number of examples and is not content with levying criticism; it questions governments and puts forward precise proposals and recommendations in many fields. I and my group are glad that the majority of our Assembly has adopted the report, which was further enriched by the adoption of my group’s amendments.

 First of all, at a time when the enlargement of the European Union is underway, I would like the Euro-Lebanese rapprochement to contribute to creating an outline for genuine joint Mediterranean construction. This must take place through a dialogue between equals. It is even more urgent as the risk of war in Iraq weighs upon relations with the Arab world as a whole. Next, as has already been said, we need to use all available means to escape the spiral of violence in the Middle East. Europe and Lebanon could play a more active part with regard to compliance with the United Nations resolutions, the creation of a Palestinian State and Israel’s full, and universal recognition in the region. I am thinking in particular of the serious basis constituted by the offer of peace adopted by the Arab countries in Beirut. Although the war in Lebanon is fortunately in the past, the absence of peace throughout the region is a barrier to genuine reconstruction and development in the country as a whole. This is especially true in southern Lebanon, where problems of borders with Israel have not been solved. Almost three years after the Israeli withdrawal, needs are still great: for example, rehabilitation of infrastructures, rebuilding homes and irrigation projects. The same is true of the Syrian presence: although it does not explain everything, it probably prevents the Lebanese from effectively erasing all the scars of war. Lebanon exists in the mind of the Lebanese, but many would like to see a stronger affirmation of their State, which would take place in particular through a truly independent, democratic State, in order to establish and develop coexistence between the Lebanese. I am thinking in particular of respect for freedom of speech, an independent judiciary, the rights of asylum seekers, those who have disappeared, and the death penalty. This is also true of the situation of Palestinian refugees. Although Lebanon is still, fortunately, a country of refuge for Palestinians, the absence of a foreseeable fair, sustainable solution aggravates the situation of great social distress in which hundreds of thousands of refugees find themselves. The right to return should be recognised as legitimate, but the discrimination that actually affects Palestinian refugees in Lebanon is unjustifiable. Access to work or social protection should be guaranteed more effectively, with our help. Lastly, we cannot ignore the social and economic aspects. While the period immediately following the war required the implementation of an ambitious reconstruction programme, the current situation is bleak. Some would say that the Lebanese economy is somewhere between the developing world and the City. The debt is USD 30 billion. There is glaring inequality. The high consumption of the wealthy goes side by side with raging poverty, intensified by an extremely high cost of living and widespread low income. The Lebanese Prime Minister did obtain aid of over EUR 4 billion in Paris last November from some European and Arab countries as well as from international financial institutions. I remain more than sceptical, however, as to the positive effects of creating a free-trade zone. The loss of customs taxes could have significant consequences for useful public spending. European aid should therefore be given through active support for the organisations operating in humanitarian and social fields. I still think that modernity and social progress consist of making the focus of Euro-Mediterranean relations human factors rather than goods and capital. The Euromed civil forum considers the social and economic assessment of the partnership to be negative overall: we should heed the critics!

 The future of care for the elderly must not be reduced to a sectoral, or even simply humanist concern, and even less so to purely financial thinking or concern for financial viability. Are these generations an asset to modern society, yes or no? Do our societies have the means to provide them with a decent future, sufficient means for care, and therefore a high-level retirement worthy of our times, yes or no? My reply is yes, a resounding yes. In France today, 40% of people retiring receive less than EUR 1 000 per month. Statistics indicate that by 2005, 30% will be approaching the poverty line. So yes, of course, funding for social protection needs to be reviewed. The problem is deciding on the principles according to which this should take place. Asking questions about the future of retirement and care therefore equates to making social choices. How can we address the causes of the debt, how can we increase the number of those participating in the national solidarity effort? By combating unemployment by means of employment policies or by making redundancies and closing businesses? I would also like to voice my opposition, as others have already done, to Article 10(c) of the report in particular, which advocates, and I quote, ‘the creation of an internal market in health services and products’. This would open the way for the attitude of pension funds which are more interested in gaining a market share than in worrying about any kind of health policy. I personally cannot envisage care being distributed according to budget. Is there not already a risk when, for example, in the United Kingdom, dialysis is no longer funded after the age of 75? On the other hand, I am sure that social benefits such as those under the French retirement system should be strengthened. In France, seven trade unions have been asking for this recently. Their joint platform demands a high-level retirement provision. They are also calling for demonstrations throughout the country on 1 February. Lastly, we have the resources to ensure a high-level retirement provision. As recommended by one of the amendments tabled by my group, we need to study new ways to fund legal retirement systems, in particular by extending social contributions to all financial income, applying the same rates as for salaries. Lastly, I would like to express my total opposition to increasing the duration of working life in France and in Europe, as recommended by the Barcelona European Council.

 Mr President, Mr President of the Commission, the three political priorities of your programme can only be assessed in light of the challenges faced by the European Union. It should, however, and I shall say this from the start, be noted that the ultra-liberal criteria that continue to affect European integration prevent us from rising to meet these challenges. The Commission thus proposes, and I quote, to ‘re-engage citizens in the European project’. I will believe that when I see it! The abyss is in fact deepening between European integration as it is and the peoples’ expectations, as expressed in particular at the European Social Forum in Florence, where hundreds of thousands of people were united in a powerful anti-war, pro-peace demonstration. The Union, however, continues to implement a security and defence policy based on the military option and alliance with NATO, instead of working towards conflict prevention. Numerous discussions, debates and demonstrations in Florence called for public services to be safeguarded, so that water, health and education might become common assets. A petition against liberalising services under the WTO, within the framework of the GATS has already been signed by 127 European and national MPs. The Commission, on the other hand, in accordance with the Barcelona and Lisbon European Councils, is pursuing and speeding up the liberalisation and deregulation process leading to privatisation in the energy, transport, postal and other sectors. It is maintaining the restrictions on public spending under the Stability and Growth Pact, even though it has been recognised at the highest level that the Pact is not as intangible as it seems. After Florence, French rail workers will take to the streets again on 26 November. In Florence, young people declared themselves in favour of a fraternal, inclusive Europe that is open to the world. The Commission programme makes fortress Europe even more impenetrable. This effective border control, however, is entirely illusory and distances us further from the inclusive Europe you spoke of yesterday morning, Mr Prodi. Common asylum and immigration policies must not be dependent on combating terrorism, an approach that would consider anything foreign to be potentially dangerous and criminalise all migrants or would view them as nothing more than economic resource. On the other hand, the road to equal rights could lead to a safe, inclusive European Union. By equal rights, I mean economic, social and political rights equally: granting foreign residents the right to vote as of the next European elections in 2004, as Commissioner Vitorino advocated before one of the Convention’s working groups, would send a strong signal in this regard for a generous, fraternal Europe that is open to the world. There is certainly an urgent need to define the future of Europe, but I do not believe we should define it in the same way as the Commission’s design and project. Must we confine ourselves to the Convention’s limited ideas concerning the institutions and rhetoric on the social dimension, must we place our trust fully in the Convention, as you said, Mr Prodi? It is not enough simply to announce that citizens are to be involved. We need to respond to their needs and hopes and fully recognise their rights, with regard to work, health, housing, education and culture, and in order to do so, we must certainly go back to the drawing board and rethink the most basic principles of the Maastricht Treaty, as it imposes a dogma of competition and a free market. We must challenge the Stability and Growth Pact and take account of the new criteria of growth, employment and training and review the responsibilities of the European Central Bank. The ruling on liberalisation and deregulation must be promulgated, public services must be recognised in the Treaty, and not only as a derogation to competition. Lastly, Mr Prodi, you spoke of the great hopes that exist in the South. I share this ambition for the European Union to play a new role in the world, to prevent conflicts, to encourage peace and genuine security. The Union should play a part in international negotiations, in particular within the WTO, and espouse concerns over genuine development in the poorest countries. In this regard, confining ourselves to the limited Monterrey commitments or the HIPC initiative is feeble, when what we should be doing instead is cancelling all the debts of the Southern countries. Lastly, although the Commission has stated its ambition to play a part in resolving the Middle East conflict, I would like to see more political initiatives being taken instead of just words, particularly in the spirit of Mr Patten’s regular position statements.

 Mr President, this is just a clarification, for the amendment should be in your voting list anyway. I would just like to say that, at the very beginning of Amendment No 5, my group proposes that the word ‘condemns’ should be replaced with the word ‘regrets’.

 Mr President, the existence and the development of an agricultural industry are key issues for the countries of the South. They often have great potential in this area. Ambitious agricultural reforms are or ought to be dedicated to this. The main issue, however, concerns these countries’ self-sufficiency in food. This is why, from the outset, I wish to support my group’s call for the right to food sovereignty, in other words, people’s right to define their own policy, to be recognised in a specific United Nations convention. Developing countries are often restricted to exporting a few unprocessed products. All the evidence suggests, however, that specialising in exports of raw materials is relatively unprofitable and weakens economies by making them subject to the whims of world markets. Furthermore, the destruction of traditional food-producing farming caused by single-crop farming for export does not benefit anyone apart from huge multinationals. Over and above this, as the report quite rightly states, unbridled global free trade has devastating effects on the agriculture of the South. The opening up of agricultural markets forces farmers to produce at prices set by the international market. These are so low that they allow neither the farmers of the North nor those of the South to produce in a way that respects the environment and at the same time to earn enough money to support their families. Given these circumstances, as one NGO working in Burkina Faso has expressed it, how can we persuade people that international trade is the key to development in the countries of the South? The countries of the North have always protected their agriculture. Why should a system that has worked well and which is still working well for the North no longer be good for the South? Should the opening up of the markets, therefore, benefit the peasant farmers or the multinationals that are buying up the banana plantations of Cameroon or Côte-d'Ivoire, for example? Enabling developing countries to safeguard their basic right to food security and to the survival of their farming methods therefore requires clear principles to be brought to international negotiations, starting with the recognition, by the WTO, of the need for preferential and differentiated treatment for developing countries, which must be interpreted with this aim in mind. As far as we are concerned, the European Union cannot continue, on the one hand, to call for the development of the countries of the South and, on the other, to uphold an agricultural policy which ruins much of their efforts in this sector. There is now, therefore, an undeniable need to speed up the elimination of export subsidies granted by the Union, and we must also condemn the major increase in subsidies for agriculture determined by the US agricultural guidance law, with subsidies of around USD 180 billion over ten years. Next, the EU ought to play a much more active role in ensuring that fair prices are set on the world market and thereby prevent the deterioration of trade terms. The burden of debt also contributes to an increase in export crops in order to obtain the currency needed to pay back this debt. Its cancellation, therefore, remains more topical than ever. Lastly, and on this note I shall conclude, with regard to aid, investment must be made as a matter of urgency in human resources and infrastructures, especially in transport. It is also crucial to preserve water and biodiversity as public commodities.

Madam President, I too would like to express my concern over the lot of development aid in the budget. Rigour is the watchword. Budget headings are removed and reduced, and I feel we are far from a budget that meets our needs and expectations. Apart from the fact that the increase in this part of the budget is only superficial, since account must be taken of the inclusion of pre-accession aid for Cyprus, Malta and, in particular, Turkey, the general trend conveyed by the figures is not an indication of a great desire on the part of the Union to shoulder its responsibilities with regard to the South. How odd it is to set the objective of eradicating poverty and, at the same time, cut funds for development aid. The cuts are clear: less for food aid, less for Latin America. They are particularly serious for the Mediterranean and the Balkans, without counting the possibility of further cuts which will have to be made if funding for aid to Afghanistan is not found from other resources. Who can we convince that this so-called reallocation of funds to other headings will lead to more appropriations, greater effectiveness in responding to the needs of the people concerned? Without a proper review of the Financial Perspectives, the pressure on heading 4 is becoming untenable. Following the abolition of the Development Council, such a budget would send a very bad signal. Another example is the negotiations which have just begun with a view to the signing of economic partnership agreements with our ACP partners. Considerable adjustment efforts are asked of them; that is a financial constraint which cannot be sustained by the ACP countries themselves or by the EDF, but which requires supplementary funds to be specially allocated by the European Union. Lastly, I wish to lend my support to my group’s proposal to create a specific heading for aid to Palestine. Some claim that the projects funded by the European Union should be abandoned, if they are destined to be systematically destroyed. Several months ago now, Commissioner Patten estimated the destruction of such infrastructures by the Israeli army at EUR 20 million. Nevertheless, the Union must certainly not give in to the law of the survival of the fittest and must act as required by law. That is what Commissioner Patten has constantly reiterated, calling for a serious and concerted effort required to reform and rebuild the Palestinian Authority, as the only viable interlocutor in future peace talks. This will be achieved through the political and budgetary transparency of this objective.

 Madam President, I say ‘yes’ to strong links between Europe and Algeria. The Algerians are practically alone in having suffered the barbarity of fundamentalist terrorism since before 11 September 2001. The European Union, for its part, must strengthen its links with the southern Mediterranean basin by freeing itself from its ideas of domination. This would be one way of countering the unilateralism of an American superpower that is more and more interested in Algeria and the wealth that lies beneath it. Although the association agreement shows the will to establish privileged links between the Union and Algeria, it also raises questions, starting with the lack of prior consultation, as denounced by Algerian independent trade unions and associations. Our resolution rightly emphasises human rights first and foremost, and the resolution must keep this aspect. Like others, I in turn would like to express my concern over the situation in Kabylia, where tomorrow’s local elections are already marked by calls for a boycott, for strikes and for the police to take control. Why has no credible solution for overcoming this crisis been put forward by the Algerian Government? Why have no legal proceedings commenced against those responsible for the oppression perpetrated in what has become known as the ‘black spring of 2001’? When will lawsuits cease against representatives of the citizens’ movement? Most of all, are these not signs of a deep malaise within Algerian society as a whole, but in particular among young people? The increasing number of lawsuits against journalists and the persistent refusal to repeal the family code, problems over which, to my great surprise, some Members wish to draw a veil in the resolution, can only stir up despair and tension. The future of Algeria, however, would be more secure under the existing potential for democracy than under a new resurgence of fundamentalist ideas. I also believe it is important to take account of urgent social issues. There is a tremendous need in terms of employment, housing, public infrastructures for health, education and water, while inequality and foreign reserves have never been so high. Unlike the rationale for free trade, which encourages liberalisation and deregulation, this situation, on the contrary, requires a true cooperation measure, for example in the field of public services. Europe therefore has a responsibility. Will the serious concerns of many players in the Algerian economy over the establishment of a free trade area be heard? What will our assessment be of the economic, social and environmental consequences? In conclusion, I would like to call for vigilance with regard to respect for the free movement of persons and equality of economic, social and political rights for Algerian nationals on European soil.

Mr President, the main objective of any agreement between the ACP countries and the European Union should consist of promoting sustainable forms of development which help to reduce poverty and constitute a basis for the integration of the ACP countries into the world economy. This excerpt from the Cape Town Declaration sums up fairly well the spirit in which the Committee on Development and Cooperation drew up the report that I shall present to you today. First of all, I would like to thank all my fellow Members who contributed by tabling numerous amendments or by participating actively in the hearings we organised, one with Commissioner Lamy, another with the Secretariat of the ACP group and two representatives of African and European NGOs. I would also like to thank the many interlocutors, key figures, NGOs and trade unionists with whom I have tried to take account of all the problems raised. The negotiations for economic partnership agreements will therefore take place tomorrow in Brussels. This is an important event that marks the end of one stage, but also the beginning of another, in which each individual must make themselves heard. With the Cotonou Agreement promising a new participative approach, the time has come to innovate. Broad public debate together with open, transparent negotiations would be a good starting point. The purpose of these negotiations coincides directly with the current debate on the correlation between trade and development. The development dimension is increasingly important in our commercial policy, as stated by Commissioner Lamy and duly noted. We are still concerned, however, that development is thus being progressively reduced to a mere dimension, an accessory to the liberalisation of trade, whereas it is specific policies that are needed here. We should certainly ask ourselves what the merits are of opening up markets in itself. It will not, for example, curb the deterioration of trade terms for poor countries, even though this is one of the main obstacles to their development and, more importantly, to their survival. Does the world really need an extra dose of free trade or a new approach to development? Can the eradication of poverty in the ACP countries be reduced to trade? Should trade not be, first and foremost, a tool for development, for satisfying the people’s needs? Should we not first address the structural causes of poverty? We believe these lie mainly in the shortcomings of production and marketing structures centring on the immediate export of raw materials instead of processing them locally and promoting South-South trade. Non-tariff barriers also constitute major obstacles to accessing the European Union market. As for guaranteed-price schemes, have they not lacked the necessary means to prevent the efforts of developing countries from being ruined by unfavourable circumstances? Lastly, the introduction of conditional criteria for structural adjustments under the aegis of the IMF and the World Bank, and the weight of reimbursing the debt certainly fall into the category of EU-ACP failures. We should nevertheless listen to the ACP countries when they campaign to retain the best aspects of Lomé, which relies heavily on the principle of non-reciprocity. The proposal for new trade relations could therefore turn out to be counterproductive were it to consist of proposing benefits which are in themselves obstacles that must be overcome. An African expert gave this example by way of illustration: we can export computers, sports cars and equipment for nuclear power stations without paying customs duties; the only trouble is that we do not make any. It is touching to know that sorghum and manioc can be exported to Europe, but sadly European consumers do not want any. Under these circumstances, do we need to establish new free trade agreements, or rather invest in production tools and make the conditions for granting manufacturing licences more flexible? These are the subjects of parallel negotiations taking place within the WTO. The European Union and the ACP countries together form a considerable proportion of WTO members, in other words a majority, a force which can and must influence negotiations until 2005, ensuring that the rights of developing countries are recognised. These countries suffer from weak economic structures which justify special treatment in order to address the causes of inequality in the world. What is needed is special and differential treatment to tackle new challenges and simultaneously encompass long-term technological, financial and trade measures designed to build sustainable capacity in each area in which there is inequality between countries. Lastly, allow me to raise a few specific questions. What is the probable impact of free trade areas on the social, economic and environmental situation of the ACP countries? Mr Lamy announced a detailed study over four years to accompany the process. Fine. But how can a relevant opinion be formulated on the proposed guidelines without using this essential information as soon as possible? Furthermore, can the Commission tell us which criteria were used for this study and what means will be available to the ACP countries to carry out their own assessment? What coherence is there between all the free trade agreements that the European Union is currently signing with various partners? What is the point, therefore, of the ACP countries signing these agreements? Let us now consider the organisation of the negotiations. Are the Commission and the Council prepared to accept the ACP group’s proposal to allow a sufficiently long first stage to clarify, as emphasised by Mr Goulongana, Secretary-General of the group, the objective of the EPAs, the principles, the ground rules, etc.? We are convinced of the need to do all we can to preserve the cohesion of the ACP group. This is also true with regard to the integration and unity process currently underway in Africa. With regard to services, we shall consider any liberalisation proposals, with the exception of education, health, water, energy and transport. That is why I am prepared to accept Amendment No 2 tabled by the PPE-DE, but as a supplement. Public services are essential factors in the social model … (The President cut the speaker off

“The increasing divide between North and South must become our new frontier, our new challenge. We got rid of a wall in Europe. We cannot accept another wall which cuts the world in two”. These were the engaging words of Romano Prodi in Johannesburg on 2 September, when he had no hesitation in mentioning the need for ‘concrete measures’ and ‘binding timetables’! Unfortunately, you know what then happened, as I do. While we should not play down the advantages of the ratification of the Kyoto Process and the initiative to reduce by half, between now and 2015, the number of people without quality drinking water and adequate sanitary conditions, the Earth Summit has not been able, whatever Mr Prodi thinks, to “restore hope to the poorest”! “Let us ensure that the twenty-first century does not become, for future generations, a crime of humanity against life”...the task of the World Summit in Johannesburg was no more and no less than that! Unfortunately, the person who uttered these words, the French President, like many other Heads of State of the world’s biggest powers, has taken little account of the challenge set: the survival of the Earth and of human existence.

 Mr President, there is nothing indecent about stating the figures on extreme poverty in developing countries. What is indecent is the wilful blind eye turned by rich countries, who, despite the horror of the situation, still carry on in the same way. It is in this context that the increasing overlap between business and development should be viewed, including here, within the Committee on Development and Cooperation. If the fight against poverty and food insecurity is to succeed, it cannot be left up to the business community. It must attack the structural causes of poverty in developing countries. Priority must be given to structural change in their economies in order to increase their share of products produced and diversified, including in the agricultural sector. That is why it is essential to promote fair access to land, water and the resources of biodiversity as well as a policy of local support for agricultural smallholdings. In order to achieve this, we must take account of three factors. Firstly, new international commitments are needed and, most of all, must be honoured. I have just come from Johannesburg. After the disappointing Monterrey and Food Summits, Johannesburg is a new opportunity for the northern Heads of State to repeat how important it is to help the people of the South but also to provide ourselves with the proper means to do so. All well and good, but when will these significant commitments be followed up by practical action? Secondly, the approach concerning multilateral trade relations should definitely be thoroughly reviewed. Within the WTO, these relations do not actually take place with a view to achieving the priorities set by the United Nations, but are dominated by the ‘give-and-take’ philosophy. What is more, the negotiation methods and pace automatically exclude many developing countries. Why refuse the protection that has enabled developing countries to implement their own industrialisation? As for the ADPIC agreements, these restrict access for local peoples in the South to their own natural resources and are incompatible with the objective of food security. Moreover, pressure in favour of the liberalisation of services endangers their public services, such as water, energy, communications, health and education. Lastly, new funding must be found urgently. In Johannesburg, the French President, Jacques Chirac, suggested taking a small percentage of the wealth created by globalisation to finance the fight against its negative effects. Who is he trying to kid? Why not suggest that the rich countries set aside the equivalent of 5% of the money they spend on subsidies for their own agriculture in order to fight hunger in developing countries? Johannesburg, in particular, is also an excellent reflection of people’s experiences and anger, but also the hopes of the numerous NGOs, associations, men and women from all continents who meet to find alternatives and draw up effective proposals. We must listen to them. To Mr Berlusconi, who said in July that it is not the fault of rich countries if they have 80% of the world’s wealth, I would say that three quarters of the world are slowly dying on the doorstep of this so-called ‘rich’ world. It is the responsibility and duty of rich countries, for the sake of fairness as well as of economic efficiency, not to limit themselves to formal commitments, voluntary guidelines or the business community, but to define a proper, restrictive code of conduct that penalises countries which fail to give the necessary aid to the poorest countries. The same applies to transnational corporations, whose exceptional power must be regulated and controlled as a matter of urgency. Although the Deva report does not demonstrate a radical will to throw off the shackles of die-hard commercial globalisation, it still raises the need to protect the economies of poor countries and cancel all or part of the debt. This is a significant starting point.
Boudjenah (GUE/NGL

 Mr President, projections based on the ‘current rate’ of decline in the number of people suffering from malnutrition suggest that it will take a century to overcome hunger in the world. Is this hard fact not enough to justify a radical rethink of the policies that are currently being pursued? The subsidies that the governments of industrialised countries pay to their own farmers are forty-eight times higher than the amount paid to support agriculture in poor countries. Direct competition between agricultural products from countries with very unequal productive systems, as well as the practices of exporting countries in the developed world, coupled with the risk of dependence facing the countries of the South if they specialise in the export of one or two primary products – these are the long-term threats to the future food security of the people who inhabit three quarters of our planet. The effects of these practices, which are totally consistent with the enshrined provisions of the WTO Agreements, are verifiable and have been verified. These practices kill. The Johannesburg summit could be an opportunity to make other choices, to focus on other avenues as yet unexplored, such as guaranteeing the right of developing countries to protect their rural economies with a view to defending their food security against multinational corporations and to supporting local food-processing businesses. Why not make hard and fast provisions for the creation of a specific fund designed to guarantee the effective achievement of all these objectives? The Director-General of the FAO has estimated that an additional amount of 24 billion dollars would be needed to achieve the aforementioned aims. The disaffection of the Heads of State at the FAO summit, however, provided confirmation that the developed countries’ would not be committing any more resources, which cannot fail to give cause for concern. The only effective remedy would be a response to the needs of the poor countries; at the Forum of the Peoples that has just been held in Sibi, Mali, for example, these countries called for the immediate and unconditional cancellation of Africa’s foreign debt and for fair payment for agricultural products and other raw materials. This is the price that has to be paid to rid the world of hunger.

 Mr President, I too have just returned from Algeria, having been a member of the parliamentary delegation. I wish to use my speaking time to describe the expectation and hope that many Algerians have placed in relations with Europe and to describe their thoughts and demands as well. Today, Algeria has, of course, passed a milestone, shall we say, by holding elections, in which the absolute majority was gained by the so-called new FLN. First and foremost, however, Algeria is a country with disastrous social conditions in which hundreds of thousands of families are struggling for survival. Eighty per cent of the country's population consists of young people, whose sole future prospect is unemployment. An additional concern is that the acceleration of the liberalisation process and our future privatisations risk making the situation worse. This social situation is, without doubt, connected to the record level of non-participation in the last elections. The Algeria of today is defined by the citizens’ movement in Kabylia, formed in spring 2001 to condemn the repression and killing of 115 young people, is still active in Algeria. It is defined by the women’s collective, by the lawyers who are defending more than 150 of the movement’s militants who have been detained, some for more than two months. Algeria is also defined by remarkable aspirations to construct a society which reconciles its identity, fundamental freedoms and development which will benefit all people. The future of Algeria certainly does not lie in repressing democratic aspirations, in restricting the freedom of the press. Instead, it lies in taking into account the often courageous action of many different associations which defend, for example, women’s rights, which call for the family code to be repealed, which care for children who have been scarred by violence, or which defend human rights. Yes, we must revive formal EU-Algerian relations, since the Algerian people have almost single-handedly been coping with an explosion of terrorist extremism for a decade now, whereas other countries only realised the extent of the danger after 11 September. A great deal of criticism and also many expectations have been expressed by our Algerian counterparts, originating in particular from associations, independent trade unions, students and the Kabyle movement, regarding the lack of prior consultation in Algeria and also the content of the association agreement. With regard to the latter, Algeria must, first and foremost, respect its international commitments on freedom but there is also the question of the social consequences of opening-up the borders and markets and of a policy that, it is claimed, is entirely liberal, at a time when the Union is presenting itself as a fortress. Lastly, it would, without doubt, be tragic if the genuine democratic potential that exists in Algerian society continues to be wasted, or even stifled. The Algerian authorities, as well as the European Union, must listen to these aspirations. I support what my fellow Members have said with regard to the Union; namely, how can the troika that visited Algiers some days ago openly bring up the question of human rights, which is a positive step, and also welcome the organisation of elections, which caused a general uproar among many Algerians? Given that these elections were boycotted by several democratic parties and by an entire region, Kabylia, I feel that we should, at least, be slightly dubious. It is true, the economic and social situation of the Maghreb people is explosive and the measures introduced by the partnership to defuse the situation have fizzled out! I would like to end by warning the European Parliament against taking any decision contrary to international law which, since 1991, has been calling for a referendum on self-determination in Western Sahara. Parliament has so far resisted giving in to the politics of the fait accompli and any deviation or change of position is not likely to be of help to the Arab Maghreb Union.

 The right of everyone everywhere to a healthy and adequate diet should be recognised and respected in practice throughout the world. It is a fundamental human right. The preparations for the World Food Summit should in fact make it possible not only to affirm this, but also to put it into practice once and for all. The time is over for expressing wishes and making declarations, too few of which are followed by action, when there are 826 million people in the world who are still suffering from hunger – almost 800 million of whom in developing countries – and when there are 2 billion people who are badly nourished. No one can be unaware that in such cases the most vulnerable are women and children. The commitment we made six years ago was already to halve the number of people suffering from hunger by 2015, but a quick calculation shows that at the current average rate of reduction of 8 million a year we will not be able to meet this objective. It is therefore a matter of urgency to address the consequences of this tragedy by of course providing financial aid, contributions and programmes, but it is also vital to tackle the root causes of this situation. The liberalisation policies encouraged by the WTO to open up the markets of developing countries pose a serious threat to countries that are already weak, as does the ever present reality of debt. Wars, policies of establishing hegemony and of seeking outlets, at whatever price, for products from the North, and the quest for profits, even when it means privatising the South's natural resources, all threaten food security. Making trade a priority over development can only widen still further the gap between opulent wealth and extreme poverty and make it harder for the South to gain sovereignty over its food supply and have this respected. Nevertheless, every country has the right to choose freely how it is going to supply itself with food. Access to adequate food and the means of producing it and access to resources are the best ways to guarantee the right to food and make it a reality. A trade policy which respects local production, the income of small farmers and the needs of the local people and where cooperation is based on a relationship between equals is the only possible way to find a lasting solution to the problem of food security in the world.

 Mr President, I would firstly like to extend my heartfelt thanks to Mr Esteve for his opening remarks explaining the amendments. I shall, of course, take note of these. It is impossible to give thought to Euro-Mediterranean relations without contemplating concerted action to bring an end to the war in the Middle East, at a time when Israeli tanks are crushing the Palestinian population and Shimon Péres himself is speaking of massacre. Sharon’s aggressive, murderous and colonial policy is leading not only the Palestinian people, but also all the people of the region – and that includes the Israeli people – towards a bloody and violent dead end. We must condemn the crimes and the destruction of infrastructure financed by the European Union. We must call for urgent aid to be sent to the civilian population and for an international protection force to be dispatched to the region. Since Mr Solana and Mr Patten claim – as they did yesterday in this very House – that acceptable boundaries have been crossed, the European Union must therefore take swift and objective action. It has the resources that are needed. It can decide to suspend the partnership agreement with Israel. The bombings and killings must stop. The settlements must be dismantled. Israel must respect the United Nations’ resolutions. These are all matters of extreme urgency. If the summit in Valencia can assist in achieving this, so much the better, but it would be totally unrealistic to think that everyone is willing to come around the table in a few days’ time – even if the Palestinian leader were able to leave the territories – if the European Union has not adopted a clear position. The Mediterranean region is in need of peace so that it can contemplate its future. Another conflict is also placing strain on this partnership, and on relations with North Africa, in particular, and that is the conflict in the Western Sahara. The good relations that the European Union enjoys with Morocco should be used to break the deadlock in this situation and to apply the United Nations’ peace plan which provides for the self-determination of the Western Saharan people. The situation that has come about since 11 September means that everyone, on both sides of the Mediterranean, must avoid any religion-terrorism equation and must work together to eradicate terrorism from its breeding grounds, which can only encourage the most violent forms of fundamentalism and nationalism. At this point, I would like to mention the growing poverty, the pillaging of natural resources and the attempts to curtail and sell off national industries. I am in favour, as Mr Esteve states in his report, of encouraging a dialogue amongst equals, which meets social needs by adopting measures to combat unemployment or which promotes trade between countries of the south. I continue to believe, however, that the path towards shared prosperity has been blocked, for the time being, by agreements which are guided by solely economic and financial interests, thus denying the needs of the people who are already suffering from the burden of debt, the drop in the price of raw materials and the austerity imposed by structural adjustments. How can we continue along the path of unbridled liberalisation, which is failing everywhere, without taking stock of previous agreements and ignoring the concerns that are growing in all parts, including the Mediterranean countries? Although one of the major objectives of the partnership is to improve the economic and social situation of our partner countries, it is now necessary, in addition to this, to satisfy basic and fundamental requirements in terms of health and education. Unemployment figures, for example, or jobs that are directly threatened due to the abolition of customs barriers – namely, 500 000 in Algeria – illustrate how far off-target we are and would even tend to illustrate that other options must be explored, such as that of cooperation between public services. Is it not also a good idea to take a bolder approach, for example, by establishing a Euro-Mediterranean development and cooperation fund, which would enable the people to define and monitor local projects? Lastly, the free movement of individuals should be the condition for an equal and fair partnership. We wish to establish harmonisation in the area of immigration and asylum, but only if this contributes to the development of the country of origin and ensures that migrants, on our soil, enjoy dignified and fair treatment which observes human rights and is based on equal rights.

Mr President, it is perfectly understandable that we should wish to examine the state of transatlantic relations in the light of the current situation. Let us begin with the decision to tax steel imports at rates of up to 30% and to impose quotas. As the main exporter to the United States, the Union is the primary target of these measures. And yet European steel imports have fallen by 33% since 1998, and so they are not the cause of the problems in the U.S. steel industry. Coming on top of the differences over hormone-treated beef and GMOs, these measures are likely to have serious economic and social repercussions for the European steel industry. The Commission would therefore be well advised to bring a complaint before the WTO, as Mr Lamy announced, as well as to apply retaliatory measures without delay against US exports. What is more, this latest decision by the Bush Administration testifies to a strengthened desire on the part of the US Government to adopt a unilateral approach in numerous domains: on the commercial and economic as well as the cultural and military fronts, and this last front is the focus of deep concern.

has just published a report indicating the existence of a secret Pentagon plan targeting Iraq, Iran, Libya, Syria and North Korea and even Russia and China. The plan apparently envisages the possibility of using nuclear arms for offensive purposes, for example in the framework of an Arab-Israeli conflict. To quote John Isaac, a leading figure in the voluntary sector in the United States, Doctor Strangelove is alive and well and working in the Pentagon. This lurch by the American superpower, on the pretext of fighting terrorism, towards a permanent war footing poses an intolerable threat to the entire planet. The United States is redefining its role in the world around one single obsession, namely its own security. But in this world, right cannot be exclusively and invariably on the side of the Americans. It was impossible not to be concerned at the words of John Bolton, Under Secretary at the Department of State, who fired this broadside during the Conference on Disarmament, and I quote: ‘Our policy is, quite simply, pro-American’ and ‘The United States … will meet this threat with every method at our disposal’. This policy, which entails a 15% increase in the military budget, equivalent in monetary terms to the entire state development aid provided by all OECD member countries, along with the planned anti-missile defence system, is liable to provoke a new arms race. The fight against terrorism, on the other hand, involves identifying its roots and seeking real solutions. And again, the United States is obstructing progress towards a fairer world by refusing to ratify several international conventions, such as those on the rights of the child, disarmament, biological weapons, the International Criminal Court, climate change, the Kyoto process and a host of others, not to mention the failure of the United States to adopt a sufficiently impartial position on the Middle East conflict. We can no longer be silent on the death penalty, a crime perpetrated by the state, where it is administered by a superpower that seeks to impose its order and its values on the world. We want nothing to do with that particular value. Numerous people, including US citizens, reject that vision of the world and aspire to globalisation based on solidarity. This was one of the messages that emerged from the World Social Forum in Porto Alegre. Europe must take heed of the ardent hopes of those who are exhorting us to play our part in the pursuit of that goal.

 Mr President, on 8 November 2001, the Council of Development Ministers urged the European Union and Member States to increase development aid. I believe that we must now take firm and visible action. How do we go about doubling the current level of aid given by industrialised countries to achieve the required USD 50 billion a year, as recommended in several of the preparatory reports for the Monterrey conference, so that we can meet the most basic requirements of developing countries, particularly in terms of education and health? What stage has the Commission reached in its negotiations with each Member State on a timetable to enable us to achieve the objective of 0.7%, which was set some 32 years ago? Although the attitude of the United States is placing the very existence of aid for development under serious threat, the Monterrey conference would be an opportunity for the European Union to prepare and set in motion a strict process to rigorously monitor this timetable. There are still other avenues to be explored. Firstly, we must cancel debt and go much further than the HIPC initiative. The crisis in Argentina is an urgent reminder – as if it were needed – of the need for us to act. The world parliamentary forum, held some days ago in Porto Alegre, also recommends, by means of a resolution, that the United Nations establish an international tribunal to combat debt in order to guarantee financing for development. Furthermore, it is time to seriously consider introducing a tax on international financial transfers. Lastly, reforms in the financial system and international trade system are obviously needed in order to make them more democratic and to combat the mechanisms which cause poverty in developing countries. Furthermore, as regards the current situation with aid, we must ensure that payments of sums are made in a swift and efficient manner as, at the end of 2000, EUR 9 billion remained in the coffers of the European Development Fund and we must also change the focus of the ODA. It is, first and foremost, private investors who find this attractive, as it helps to further develop each country’s specialist knowledge of production niches for exporting goods in terms of the requirements of the global market and not of populations. The commitments made towards developing countries must be honoured. This is a legitimate expectation of the 2.8 billion people who live on less than USD 2 per day.

 The annual report on the human rights situation in the European Union, on the one hand, and in the world on the other is a laudable and useful means of reviewing the Union’s policy in this area. It is certainly a necessary undertaking when we think of the infringements of human rights perpetrated against millions of men and women in too many parts of the world. I will confine myself to two specific issues in this debate. First of all I am thinking of the disturbing decline of the situation in Tunisia, at this very moment. In the coming five days alone, militant democrats will be further harassed with at least three political trials coming up: the trial of the journalist Sihem Ben Sedrine, brutally arrested as he stepped from the plane; Doctor Moncef Marzouki; and Fathi Chamkhi, President of ATTAC Tunisia. The European Parliament has already, on several occasions, condemned this unacceptable repression. Yet it still needs to acquire effective tools and the necessary political will to ensure respect for the Association Agreement provisions on human rights, so that it can exert pressure that goes beyond mere words. This question is all the more topical when we remember that on his visit to Tunis Commissioner Patten reaffirmed that Europe wants to act in close conjunction with Tunisia to give new impetus to the partnership. It is indeed a real and beneficial partnership for the people on the two shores of the Mediterranean, but it must be based on the recognition of freedom of expression, movement and opinion. So when will we see a special Association Council on these issues with Tunisia? The human rights situation really has declined. Arrests, violence and torture are the common lot of the militant men and women who support human rights and who quite simply want to establish and live in a free society. But there are also signs of a decline in the rights that affect the day-to-day life of every individual in the European Union itself. Everyone, be he a European citizen or a foreign resident, has the essential right to a job, to acceptable wages, to a roof over his head. The same applies to political rights, to the right to be treated as a full rather than a second-rate citizen in one’s place of residence. Accordingly, it should become the established rule that third-country nationals who have resided in the Union for at least five years have the right to vote and stand for election, as advocated by the Council of Europe since 1992. Let me conclude by saying how urgently necessary this is to the very future of a Union based on solidarity when we remember that the prospect of several candidate countries’ participating in the elections...

 Thank you for your answer. I was expecting you to give the same answer as the one you gave in writing. I would, however, like to point out to you that support for a Tobin-type tax is increasing. This support is coming from organisations of economists, naturally, but also from political institutions, as a result of the fact that certain positions have been taken up in the Finnish and Canadian parliaments, and again in Argentina, quite recently, even in Great Britain, and here, in the European Parliament. It is said that this type of tax could only be effective if it were chosen and implemented by several countries or areas of the world. This is often the argument used against it. It is certainly true but a first step in that direction is absolutely necessary in order to clamp down on financial speculation which is sweeping the planet, whereas new resources are urgently needed for investments to help people, particularly in developing countries. We must be aware, and you know this, that USD 1 500 billion pass through the stock exchange every day and half of these transactions are made on the European stock markets. There is no doubt that if the European Union decided to take this step, the impact would be considerable. Do you not think, therefore, that the Commission could at least carry out a feasibility study?

 Mr President, for ten days the region of Kabylia was the scene of a series of very serious incidents. Following the death, on 18 April, of the young high school student, Guermah Massinissa in the police station at Beni Douala, impressive peaceful demonstrations were held at several locations, demanding that the persons responsible for this ‘mistake’ be brought to justice. In addition, thousands of demonstrators, often very young, turned out to demand important social measures in this region, which has been hard hit by unemployment, poverty and even a housing shortage. Without doubt, the roots of this discontent lie in the serious social crisis which has affected the whole of Algeria. One rightly wonders if speeding up the process of liberalisation and privatisation already under way risks exacerbating the situation. There is also a strong cultural demand in this region for the Amazigh language and culture to be respected, especially since the Berber Spring in 1980. Provocation and other abuses of authority by the police with respect to the population also seem to be at the root of this positive outburst of anger. So these were peaceful demonstrations calling for more social progress and greater freedom and democracy. The marches turned into clashes which were put down by the security forces with a great deal of violence over a period of several days, leaving dozens dead and hundreds wounded. Numerous eye witness accounts printed in the newspapers talk of outright brutality. President Bouteflika and the national assembly announced that committees of inquiry would be set up. We can only hope that they will be set up as quickly as possible and will have the means needed to work efficiently – and, more importantly, transparently – so that sanctions can be imposed on those responsible for the repression. In another indication of the seriousness of the situation, the Rally for Culture and Democracy Party said that it was ‘impossible for it to stay in a government which fires on young people’ and withdrew from the coalition. I am positive that the future of Algeria, whose people have courageously resisted barbaric pressure from Muslim fundamentalist terrorist groups, lies not in repression but in heeding the people's social demands and the often very courageous action of the various associations acting to defend women's rights, secure the repeal of the family code, care for traumatised children, keep solidarity alive in the face of serious social difficulties or defend human rights. Nor does the future reside in the worrying restrictions on the freedom of the press which will result if the planned amendments to the penal code are adopted. The European Parliament delegation travelling to Algiers tomorrow will certainly help us to gain an insight into the Algerian situation from our various contacts and listen in return to their expectations of the European Union. In the same spirit, it will inspire the Commission to continue negotiations with a view to an Association Agreement, while taking better account of the opinion of political, trades union and community organisations.

 For months we have heard that incessant rain has caused serious flooding in numerous regions of France. In the département
 of the Somme, where there was three times the normal rainfall between October 2000 and April 2001, several dozen communes
 are still under water. Thousands of people have been evacuated, often having lost everything. The damage to infrastructures, houses and crops has been put at several billion francs. Human and material resources have been deployed at all levels to cope with the crisis which families have been suffering for months now. This wave of solidarity, however, which many citizens have been involved in, is still not enough. The European Union should, I think, as others have already said, take an active part in this solidarity by paying emergency aid to the people affected, so that infrastructures can be restored and economic activity restarted. This is the main demand in the resolution by our group, which also stresses the need to step up action to protect ecosystems and fight the pollution which are partly to blame for increasingly frequent climatic disasters.

 Mr President, the Commission has decided to haul France up before the Court of Justice because of its delays in liberalising the gas market, as laid down in the 1998 directive. Opening up the energy sector to competition is indeed vehemently opposed by the unions, which reject the idea that the right to energy should be regulated by the dictates of money. In 1997 and 1998, our group opposed this directive. Because we refused to accept the creation of a system based on competition, we proposed guaranteeing a fair supply at the best price, the fair treatment of users and a standardised system of charges. Energy is of strategic importance to the Member States’ economies and should not, therefore, be considered to be a commodity like any other. If we implement the directive suddenly, we risk putting all gas operations solely in the hands of huge multinational groups, and thereby seeing the conditions of public service deteriorate. Once again, it has to be said that the Commission appears to be in more of a hurry to see the principles of free competition applied than to worry about the fate of employees. Instead of contributing to speeding up the process of liberalisation and deregulation, should the Commission, when presented with any new proposal, not undertake a study of the consequences of plans for liberalisation on employment, on working conditions and regional planning? I therefore call on the Commission to renounce its dogmatic position and to withdraw its charges at the Court of Justice.

 Mr President, I thank the President-in-Office of the Council, although I should like express my disappointment that we are unable to ensure that the quite important and strict criteria of this code of conduct are respected. Amongst these criteria I would highlight the idea of banning the sale of arms to countries or regions that are involved in conflict. This matter is so serious that now, in the United Kingdom, MPs have obtained the right to vet arms sales from their country to anywhere the world. This move has created quite a stir in that country, even though the decision is not retroactive and British MPs cannot take action on this matter of arms sales to the Western Sahara. I would nevertheless put my question once again: do you not think that there may be ‘sanction’-type measures that the European Union could take when this code of conduct is breached? Furthermore, what concerns me the most is that this affair appears to demonstrate Morocco’s desire to rearm itself. Deplorably, it also demonstrates the support that the country is receiving within Europe. This can only heighten the already tense atmosphere in the region. Although the situation in this 25-year-old conflict is currently deadlocked, largely as a result of Morocco blocking the validation of the electoral lists established by MINURSO (United Nations Mission for the Referendum in Western Sahara), there is a risk of armed hostilities flaring up overnight. Can I ask the President-in-Office of the Council whether the Swedish Presidency plans to issue a statement on the matter before the end of June? I am thinking back to the German Presidency, which made a specific statement on Western Sahara. Given this background, why does the European Union not officially recognise the Polisario Front as a negotiating partner in this conflict, something that the United Nations did 25 years ago?

 Commissioner, you described the ‘Everything but Arms’ initiative as a world first. If this initiative begins to have a real effect in the near future, bringing about a qualitative and effective improvement in the quality of the living conditions of the people concerned, then, yes, it will be a world first. Even so, if I may, I would firstly like to ask about the timing of this initiative, which is scheduled a few months prior to the re-launch of the WTO negotiations. It would be regrettable if this proposal were used primarily to attempt to bring round all the developing countries to the European position at the WTO. I would, however, like to look at the content of this initiative. Europe imports six times the amount of agricultural products from LDCs than the United States, yet this only represents 1% of all the European Union’s exports. This shows the magnitude of the effort that rich countries must make in order to attempt to restore some balance within the world trade system, which more than works in their favour. Several aspects of this initiative give me cause for concern, however. First of all, the lack of consultation with either Parliament or the ACP countries, which are stressing, as they did at the Joint Assembly, that the preferential system for sugar, for example, as well as all the Community protocols, could be compromised. Also, the need to reclassify impact studies in order to improve understanding and take into account the legitimate concerns expressed with regard to the potential negative effects. Then, products destined for industrialised countries should benefit from access to minimum guaranteed prices and should be protected from fluctuations in exchange rates, whereas the economies of the LDCs are all too often dependent on the international environment and on the exports of one or two basic products. Lastly, diversifying production must be actively encouraged, all the more so because, as confirmed by experts at the United Nations, production capabilities were weakened in the last decade and some industries died out due to competition from imports. The French High Council for International Cooperation stresses, for example, that the right of the LDCs to protect and to support their fragile industry, particularly in terms of their food safety, must be recognised. Now, in order to guarantee this sovereignty of food, to make considerable progress in meeting the people’s most pressing needs and to have access to technology, the LDCs are in dangerous and vital need of substantial external funding, and for this to be provided in a spirit of cooperation which will help develop their production capacity. If we can give them help by opening up our markets to their products, the liberalisation of trade cannot be seen as a development policy. How, indeed, can essential needs be met when the growing burden of debt continues to condemn every attempt made by these countries to invest in a future? In 1970, this debt was equal to 10% of the developing countries’ GNP, and now it represents more than 40% of their GNP, whereas the total amount of public money given is less than that paid in interest on the debt. France had, in fact, made a commitment at the second Conference on LDCs to give 0.20% of its GNP, but in 1999, only 0.08% was actually given. I cannot stress enough the gravity of the situation behind these figures  half of the population lives on less than EUR 2 per day, one in three does not have access to electricity, one child in three suffers from malnutrition. The time has come, therefore, to listen… (President cut the speaker off)

 Mr President, we all know that words are no longer enough to condemn these situations in which whole families are thrown out of their country, like the 908 people crammed into the holds of the “East Sea”, seeking a better life, or fleeing war, violence or poverty, sometimes both. Words should now be followed by actions. In March, when Parliament rejected, fortunately, several Council initiatives, I wondered when we would have any Council initiatives and proposed directives drawn up in a spirit of openness towards the world, of welcome and humanity, rather than reflecting an approach concerned solely with policing and security. Yes, Europe does have a duty to take initiatives, but not the sort of initiatives that would cause a breach of solidarity, or impose arbitrary sanctions on transport companies. On the contrary, a common policy on immigration requires ambitious initiatives based on improving and strengthening the right of asylum, guaranteeing both that right and the right to freedom of movement, and facilities for receiving migrants with dignity and with respect for human rights. We also need to take restrictive and punitive measures, not against the victims, but against those who are behind this human traffic. So when shall we see an end to the expulsions, when will the situation of illegal immigrants living on European soil be regularised, and when will non-Community foreigners have the right to vote in local elections? It is impossible to avoid answering these questions if we want to move towards a policy that is more just, more humane and more effective.

 Mr President, on the subject of aid to developing countries, and in particular to those known as the least-developed countries, what are the facts? We discovered these facts just now. The mandate for the third UN conference covers, in particular, public development aid, debt and trade. In that case, we must not try to evade the following conclusion, namely that the commitments made for the preceding decade have not been fulfilled. It has often been said, but it is necessary to repeat it, that the decrease in the flow of public development aid is unacceptable. It has dwindled by almost half during the last decade, falling to only 0.05% of the GDP of the donor countries, far below the 0.7% objective set by the UN. In Europe, only the northern countries are meeting this commitment. Moreover, the proportion of this public development aid that is spent on economic infrastructure and the production sector has also been reduced. What does the future hold for these countries, if they cannot achieve a level of development which will enable them to make choices that are truly independent? There is no need to seek further afield for the reasons for the results that have been obtained. The mere mention of the fall in life expectancy to 51 years gives an indication of the size of the disaster. Behind the experts’ reports there are men and women who are living in extreme poverty: 614 million people, or one tenth of the world’s population, who live on less than two dollars a day. Worse that this, as UNCTAD reports, the least-developed countries are caught in a downward spiral and a vicious circle of economic regression, social tensions and violence, which all reinforce one another. Thus the proportion of their GDP accounted for by the manufacturing sector has not increased, and in some cases it has even decreased. The LDCs are still, in many cases, exporters of only one or two basic products. Production capacity has been reduced in some countries. For example, the committee that is preparing for the third conference has even noted that very often the industries created to supply the internal market have been forced out of the market by the increasingly keen competition from imports which is the result of liberalising trade. The third UN conference must not be just another ritual gathering, and I believe that the European Union, which is to some extent hosting the summit, should help to make sure that it does not turn into one. Europe’s political authority is achieved from its capacity to stand up to an all-consuming globalisation governed only by the laws of commerce and of money. The effectiveness of its development policy is measured by practical action, and there are avenues which still need to be explored as a matter of urgency, such as debt cancellation, the need for urgent action to recognise the right of countries hit by AIDS to manufacture and sell the necessary medicines, the need for high-quality public education services to contribute to the crucial development of human capabilities, and the need to help these countries to become self-sufficient in food. I believe that development cannot be summed up simply as the organisation of trading relations... (The President cut the speaker off)

 Mr President, what is the best way to keep out all the undesirables? What further barriers can we add to fortress Schengen to protect ourselves from outside threats? That is the impression made on me by some aspects of the reports we will be voting on today; at the same time I approve the three rejections. Less than a month after the tragedy of the East Sea
 that ran aground on the French coast, with 908 people crammed into the holds of an old tub, including three babies born during the crossing, we run the risk of perpetuating the image of a Europe that is suspicious of foreigners and wants, above all, to strengthen its borders, while alleging that the intention is to combat the trafficking in human beings. The European Union cannot pursue an immigration policy based purely on policing, as the President of the French Human Rights League said a few days ago. The news shows us more horrors by the day and we hear expressions of indignation and emotion from all sides. We are bound to be shocked by the pictures of Kurdish families, dreaming of peace and freedom, who came to seek a future without persecution. They follow on from the pictures of the 58 Chinese immigrants who reached Dover only to be found dead among crates of tomatoes, of the fugitives from Bangladesh, Pakistan, Albania, Iraq, Africa or any other region stricken by poverty and war. Article 14 of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights states that everyone has the right to seek and to enjoy in other countries asylum from persecution. So the time has now come to strengthen the right of asylum as set out in the Geneva Convention; the idea of temporary protection, which does not prejudge recognition of refugee status, goes in that direction. We know that trafficking in human beings exists and that there are criminal networks. We are all aware that fabulous sums can be made out of exploiting human misery. So if we are to combat this trafficking effectively we will have to attack the roots of the evil. Repression alone is not enough. We must impose severe penalties on those who organise and are responsible for this trafficking but we must also look into the reasons why individuals, exploited in a cowardly way, find themselves shunted from country to country, from continent to continent, in their search for El Dorado – all in the name of liberal globalisation. We must not confuse the traffickers with their victims. We must seek out and penalise those who exploit illegal labour. In fact, immigration and economics go hand in hand. Yet the proposal to harmonise the penalties imposed on carriers could prove to be the wrong track to follow and could even be turned against certain people who are simply trying to help men and women under threat. Let us not make solidarity and humanity into an offence. While the European Union is rightly seeking to pursue a humane development policy, let us make it clear that development depends on the free movement of people, their knowledge, their culture, as well as their suffering and their hopes. We must guarantee that freedom of movement. A society that decides to be tight-fisted and selective in granting residence permits, visas, places in holding centres, is a closed and sectarian society. Do we want a Europe that shuts itself off from the world; do we want a Europe that sorts people out and divides them up into good and bad refugees, acceptable immigrants and permanent exiles? When will we see Council initiatives and proposals for directives drawn up in a spirit of openness to the world, a spirit of welcome and humanity, rather than one concerned primarily with policing and security? Frantz Fanon wrote, “We always want to walk in the company of man, of all men.” I hope with all my heart that Europe can finally offer us that freedom.

 Mr President, questions such as the presence of GMOs in our food and uncertainty about their effects on humans and on the environment are now in the public domain, and that is for the best. In France, the press gave a great deal of coverage to the European Parliament vote on this directive at second reading. French and European citizens alike are expecting the Members they elected to have a clear standpoint – the scandals involving contaminated blood and mad cow disease should give them a right to this, as if any justification were necessary. Along with other Members, I believe that the findings of the Conciliation Committee fall far short of alleviating the concerns voiced by European society. The notorious lack of any requirement for traceability is a source of provocation to all the people who wish, quite legitimately, to be kept informed. Yet, the right to information is not always acknowledged. The proposed regulations must guarantee the reliable labelling and traceability of GMOs and derived products. In addition, we must ensure that those who produce and release GMOs are held responsible. We must denounce the lobbying by unscrupulous laboratories and the multinational companies who represent them. To sum up, I would like to take the opportunity afforded by the final reading of the directive in order to highlight the responsibility of the Council, which failed to adopt all Parliament’s amendments after first reading which went in this direction and which would have produced a quite different text. What is going to be adopted as the definitive text is in danger of completely invalidating the moratorium of June 1999, whereas the precautionary principle would instead put the lives and health of men and women before any other considerations, especially financial considerations.

 Mr President, although the Barcelona Process raised hopes and expectations, today we must register disappointment. What yesterday were laudable ambitions, such as calls for an area of shared prosperity, for a balancing of North and South, a commitment to enhancing peace and stability, are now urgent issues. While we all see the need to relaunch the partnership, there is, however, a divergence in the options we favour. The future of the very concept of a partnership lies not in adjusting the needs of these populations to the market forces at work in the North and to our personal ambitions, but instead in ensuring their own development and resolving their urgent issues. I believe, therefore, that Europe should adopt some approach other than simply supporting these countries in establishing the free-trade area that Europe was to set up. Enabling cooperation agreements, particularly through public services, seeking other financial resources, by introducing a Tobin-style tax, for example, and reducing or even writing off debt would give real substance to a fair and useful partnership. This approach would favour North-South relations without the element of domination. The same applies to human rights. Our associations with countries in the Mediterranean region can only be built on trust. We are, therefore, extremely concerned about human rights violations in Tunisia, for example, because the agreements signed by both parties oblige them to respect human rights. The same applies to the European Union’s respect for the rights of all citizens. I am thinking here of the need for a more integrated and more generous approach to migration. It is inhuman and ineffective to advocate the free movement of goods and capital but not of people. Experience shows that closing borders serves only to force immigrants with no identity papers and no rights into the hands of smugglers and other unscrupulous dealers. How can we speak of managing immigration in a more humane manner, how can we hope and pray for further integration, if we do not question its foundations? We must safeguard the freedom of movement of persons and equality in social, economic, cultural and political rights. To sum up, in order to create an area of peace in the Middle East, the European Union needs to take much more direct and resolute action. From now on, the United Nations resolutions must be applied in full, Israel must respect its commitments and we must recognise the Palestinians’ legitimate right to their own state. The same problem – I am about to finish – can be seen in the Western Sahara, where there is a risk that armed conflict will be resumed. Despite all this, the European Union has everything to gain by bringing together all parties, such as associations, local authorities and unions, who are already establishing a different form of partnership.

 Mr President, last Tuesday night, 11 people were murdered at a false roadblock in the Ain Defla province; on Saturday, 24 December, a young cabaret singer was murdered in a discotheque in the town of Annaba; a week before that, 16 high school students were savagely murdered inside their own boarding school. Algeria has just experienced its bloodiest Ramadan for two years. Over two hundred people – men, women, children, the elderly – have been murdered; girls have been abducted and raped. The horrendous, barbarous and inhuman violence perpetrated by the Islamist guerrilla groups appears to be on the increase, if indeed it ever actually ceased. This information is obtained mainly from the newspapers. Indeed the relative official silence, except perhaps in the case of foreigners, can only be regretted. So I should like to pay tribute to the Algerian press, one of the most independent in the Arab world, which has paid such a high price at the hands of those who are implacably opposed to any form of freedom of expression and who dream of an uneducated people subject to their diktats. Yet, in the last year, and more, thousands of terrorists are supposed to have surrendered their weapons in return for a total amnesty. The election of President Bouteflika had given the people hope, but we are forced to acknowledge that the path taken by the ‘civil concord law’ is a very long way from leading to peace. Even though the Algerian people displayed remarkable resistance in order to reject fundamentalism, the amnesty for such murders – described by some as crimes against humanity – and the lack of punishment enforced upon the perpetrators of these crimes appear to have exonerated them to the point that they are continuing their murderous work. Surely attention should be paid instead to the opinions of the associations of the families of the victims of terrorism, which are outraged that they have received no form of compensation while ‘penitent’ Islamist rebels are given financial support in order to be reintegrated into society? Surely the doubly courageous fight of Algerian women should be recognised, since they are the main victims of terrorism yet, at the same time, still subjected to a family code which flouts their most basic rights? Finally, the economic and social situation is also perilous, when it already proved a propitious breeding ground for the rise of Islamism in the 1980s. Subject to intense external pressures – I am thinking of debt – Algeria finds itself in a crisis which has already led to an unprecedented rise in unemployment. More than ever, solidarity with the democrats and with an Algeria which is fighting against terrorism and death and for a free future is urgently needed.

Mr President, allow me to start by welcoming Imen Derwiche and Nourredine Ben Tisha to the public gallery; they are young Tunisian students who were tortured and imprisoned for several months. Action is needed quickly, which is why we decided to include this item on the agenda. The very existence of the oldest human rights league in Africa and the Arab-speaking world, the Tunisian League, is under threat, despite being recognised by President Ben Ali. Judicial proceedings to have it wound up were instituted following its last congress, which appointed directors who are obviously not to the Tunisian authorities' liking. Its fate is to be decided at a hearing scheduled for 25 December, which is surprising, because this date is also a Muslim public holiday this year. As we speak, police forces have surrounded the premises of the Tunisian National Council for Liberties and even the private residences of some of its members. This police operation has already used force to prevent the National Council of the League from meeting in Bizerte and the Tunisian National Council for Liberties from meeting in Tunis. Its spokesman, Moncef Marzouki, risks being sentenced to over 10 years in prison at a hearing the day after tomorrow, on 16 December. Finally, political prisoners have been on hunger strike in prison, some of them for two months. Some, such as Béchir Habid, are in a critical condition. Their very life is in danger. Repression is on the rise, arrests and intolerable cases of torture are increasing in number. This is no longer a question of attacks on the freedom of expression, association or assembly; now, freedom of movement, freedom of speech and the freedom to receive persons of one's choice are difficult to exercise in Tunisia. Men and women are harassed daily and their families harassed as well. One example is Mehdi Zougah, a French-Tunisian citizen, who was arrested at Tunis airport on 11 August. For four months his wife and children have been waiting for him at home in Marseilles. He will stand trial on 8 January on charges of having attended a meeting of the Tunisian opposition in France, which he denies. It is a case of the most blatant arbitrariness. The Tunisian authorities should pay heed to the concern and outrage being expressed in this Chamber. They should listen to the representative of the UN Secretary-General for human rights who expressed her acute concern on 7 December, calling for an end to the practice of harassing defenders of human rights. The Tunisian authorities should realise once and for all that we are determined not to relax our vigilance and to continue to press for fundamental rights to be respected.

 Mr President, since I only have one minute, I shall confine myself to a single issue and say that the strengthening of relations between the European Union and the United States should not only concern economic and commercial issues. I would therefore ask you and the European Union representatives attending Monday’s Summit to tackle political issues and, more specifically, the issue of the death penalty at the same level. It is impossible to remain silent about this State crime, especially when it is committed by the most powerful nation on earth which too often attempts to impose its own order and values on the rest of the planet. That particular value, at any event, is one that we do not want. It is impossible to accept that the only solution to crime and violence is further crime and violence. It is therefore necessary to take action to prevent the irreversible fate that awaits those women and men who, like Mumia Abu-Jamal or Leonard Pelletier, have sometimes been on death row for years. Throughout the world, voices are being raised to demand a form of justice which is a genuine reflection of the values of human respect and of the basic rights and freedoms of the individual. On every continent, a petition demanding the abolition of the death penalty is being signed by hundreds of thousands of people. As Nicole Fontaine rightly reminded us this morning, preserving this most precious commodity called life means, in the end, obtaining a universal moratorium on the death penalty as a first step towards its abolition. I believe that advantage should be taken of the dialogue that exists between the European Union and the United States in order to finally achieve this objective.

 Turkey’s accession to the European Union is an issue that has become even more topical. Unlike some others, I am not stirring up the religious argument in order to put off this prospect. This cannot, however, be just a formality. I am thinking, instead, of acknowledgement of the Armenian genocide of 1915. In the country currently holding the Presidency of the European Union, the French National Senate recently at last proclaimed this significant act of public recognition, two and a half years after the French National Assembly. Acknowledging this act of genocide does not mean that the present-day Turkey is a barbaric nation. Quite the contrary, a nation only grows in stature by facing up to its past. How could Europe maintain its credibility with regard to the state violence perpetrated in the world today, even, at times, including genocide, if it were to embrace Turkey as a Member while brushing aside its history? Furthermore, the ongoing denial and repression of the Kurdish people is as appalling as it is unacceptable. The Turkish parliamentarian, Leyla Zana, winner of the Sakharov Prize, and in prison since 1995 merely for haven spoken in Kurdish within the Turkish Parliament, is still languishing in prison. These are facts that the European Parliament has highlighted on a number of occasions. There is no justification for our omitting them today.

 Mr President, Commissioner, I share the determination which has been expressed to give a new boost to the Euro-Mediterranean partnership forthwith. Even those behind the Barcelona process consider that it has broken down – that is the description which has been used – and it is a long way from having fulfilled its promises. In this respect, today’s motion for a resolution falls a long way short of the declared ambition. The peoples of the South are often critical and are concerned about this failure. I share their impatience, and even their disappointment and their anger, at the delays but also at the inadequacies of this partnership and at the initial damage it has caused. There are still extreme disparities between the two sides of the Mediterranean, which keep the peoples of the South in an explosive economic and social situation, with poverty and unemployment, particularly among young people. The path leading to an area of shared prosperity has, for the time being, stopped at the association agreements, which are governed by strictly economic and financial interests in denial of the needs of the people. These populations, however, are already suffering under the weight of the debt, the drop in the price of raw materials and imposed structural actions. The free trade area is in danger of considerably intensifying these imbalances, even though there is an urgent need, instead, for greater collaboration in order to meet needs. I am thinking in particular of public services, more especially in the areas of water, education, health, public transport and housing. This partnership will have no future unless it has the benefit of close cooperation with the representatives of the citizens concerned, the associations, the NGOs, the trade unions and civil society as a whole. Moreover, the dream of peace on both sides of the Mediterranean should be listened to and the wish granted at the earliest possible opportunity. The spiralling violence in the Middle East, the war being waged so violently and resolutely against the Palestinian people, whose right to statehood is still being denied by Israel, are all threatening the future of the entire region. The European Union must, as the Palestinian leaders expressly request, henceforth take bold action in order to put an end to the gunfire, to promote effective dialogue and actively militate in favour of applying the UN resolutions. The Marseilles Conference could have been used to this end. The failure – or, at least, the relative failure – of the Charter for Peace and Stability proves that it is not possible to achieve Europe’s “security” on the basis of marginalising the South and closing borders. These last few days in Marseilles, I have observed the great numbers of speakers addressing such comments to the Conference of Ministers, speaking in favour of cancelling debt and replacing free trade with relations of mutually supportive codevelopment...

Thank you for your reply. You referred to a mutually acceptable solution. I myself have visited the camps at Tindouf where this extremely difficult situation has been going on for 25 years. It must be noted, however, that one of the parties involved, Morocco in this instance, that has diplomatic weight and the wheels of state at its disposal, is making less of an effort to ensure that the peace plan, in other words the Houston agreements that it did, in fact, sign, is implemented. It continues to talk about the problem of territorial integrity, a term used by the King, particularly during his last official speech. Now, the issue relates to the self-determination of a nation and the implementation of United Nations resolutions. Whatever the result of the referendum – independence or annexation to Morocco – it seems to me that democracy is what will finally resolve this conflict most effectively. Otherwise, the exacerbation of current tensions and the possible return to arms would be dangerous for the region as a whole at a time when we are discussing – and we were even doing so earlier in this Chamber – the resumption of the Euro-Mediterranean partnership. How can we even consider reviving this partnership without first resolving the conflict? We are well aware of the close links between the European Union and Morocco and, in particular, between France and Morocco, which is why I wanted to ask Mr Moscovici if he could inform us as to the content and nature of negotiations that he is currently holding with the Moroccan Government on the Western Sahara question.

Mr President, it is high time we adopted a universal moratorium on the death penalty, this ‘veritable administrative murder’, as Albert Camus called it. This is what I was saying in this House back in October of last year, when mobilisation was urgently called for to prevent the black American journalist, Mumia Abu Jamal, being executed. What is the position today? A total of 77 states still see the death penalty as the appropriate response to certain crimes. In 1999, 1813 people were executed in 31 countries and there are at least 3 857 people condemned to death in 63 countries. The life of Mumia, who is waiting for a possible review of his trial, is, more than ever, hanging by the thread of international solidarity. So what approach is the European Union going to adopt to ensure that the death penalty disappears before the end of the century? During phase 2 of his life on death row, Mumia Abu Jamal sent this courageous message: ‘Phase 2 is the second phase of the fight. We will win’. Indeed, encouraging signs bear witness to the rising abolitionist trend at a global level. Like the European Parliament, the United Nations is now participating in the inevitable debate that is taking place across all levels of society. In the United States, opinion is still very much in favour of capital punishment, but its hold has been shaken. A study by the University of Columbia brought to light an almost 60% rate of errors committed in twenty years in the executions that were carried out. Innocent people are being killed and racism is evident in the application of the death penalty. The residence of the governor of Texas and the Republican candidate for the White House is regularly the target of demonstrations by opponents of the death penalty. The European Union must put its full weight behind achieving this moratorium and imposing it as an inviolable principle on all nations still practising this form of state-sanctioned murder which, as Victor Hugo declared, ‘traumatises the human conscience’. Nineteen years after the abolition of the death penalty in France, initiatives are currently being taken in favour of a national day for the institution of a universal moratorium on capital executions. And I am in favour of this proposal being advanced at a European level. On 10 December, hundreds of thousands of petitions will be handed in to the United Nations. The Presidency of the European Union could also join this campaign, thereby giving inspiration and crucial backing to those who are fighting for abolition. The mobilisation of Europe is critical.

 I shall, of course, continue in the same vein, especially as I feel we must consider that this debate bears witness to the fact that increasing numbers of people, particularly within the European Union, are wondering about applying stricter control to financial speculation and also about the ability of the political authorities to intervene in this economic sphere and the extravagant powers of the multinationals. Further to the comment which Danielle Auroi made just now on the subject of the countries of the South, I would add that there are some expert estimates which provide some interesting figures, for instance, a range between USD 50 and 250 billion, which could be recovered by a Tobin-type tax, whereas, at the same time, the UNDP [United Nations Development Programme] amounts to USD 40 billion per annum, which would be sufficient to guarantee minimum living conditions for the hundreds of millions of deprived people in the countries of the third world. So, at a time when people feel that politics does not have the ability to intervene in the economic sphere, and also more generally in the role of European construction in order to alter its conduct of international relations, do you not think that a measure of this kind could contribute to restoring confidence in the political world’s power to act and, hence, could it not serve as a message sent out to the countries and the peoples of the South?

 Mr President, combating discrimination and passing legislation against it means acknowledging that is exists and that many forms of it are in a sense ‘decriminalised’ because they are so commonplace. I therefore, obviously, welcome today’s directive, whose application must also become the norm. I shall therefore confine my remarks to the limitations which, I feel, still remain in spite of everything. Firstly, the burden of proof. The directive takes a step forward in shifting the burden of proof but does not go as far as to reverse the situation. Yet, should the law not provide the victims of discrimination with better means to escape the isolation they too often find themselves in? How is it possible to think that a job applicant, rejected in such circumstances, has the same resources as a firm, especially a large undertaking, to defend himself and prove that he has indeed been a victim of discrimination? Moreover, if it were compulsory for firms to prove that their practices were non-discriminatory, they would doubtless think twice on the matter when recruiting. I am thinking particularly here of the discrimination affecting third-country nationals, but also the second-generation children from immigrant families. There are many examples of this in France. Given an identical curriculum vitae, identical education and identical career, a young person with a French sounding name has four to five times the chance of being recruited than a young person with a North African sounding name, and twice that of a young person with a Portuguese or Spanish sounding name. This is the hierarchy of discrimination. In a Europe that is supposed to be multicultural where diversity is respected, we must ensure that our deeds live up to our words. Let me end on the subject of the exemption granted to religious bodies. I would like to say that I consider the exemption of Article 4(2) to be very dangerous and perhaps even a legal cover for the most reactionary ideas. Earlier, the idea of abuse of the provisions was mentioned. I feel that this may provide a major foothold for those most reactionary ideas. Mr Paisley’s objectionable intervention earlier with regard to homosexuals bears witness to this.

 Mr President, the MEDA programme is a crucial instrument for enabling us gradually to establish a genuine area of shared prosperity, as stated in the Barcelona Declaration. The difficulties in setting it up, the impatience and even the disappointments it has caused our southern partners should nevertheless encourage us to look more deeply into the state of the Euro-Mediterranean partnership as a whole. The southern Mediterranean countries need European aid, aid that demonstrates solidarity and which contributes to the development of their society. This aid must also reduce the disparities between the two sides of the Mediterranean, by putting an end to the existing relationship of economic domination, the most obvious and most unfair example of which is perhaps the system maintaining national debt. What role does MEDA have to play in this? With more than EUR 3 billion in commitment appropriations for 1995-1999, MEDA I actually committed just over EUR 2 billion in its first four years and actually paid out EUR 553 million, or scarcely a quarter of the credits committed. What a discrepancy between the aid promised and the aid actually provided! This discrepancy is largely due to the fact that, as Mr Patten has often told us, the Commission lacks the human resources to deal with all the tasks that are assigned to it. I am sure that I will not be the last person to call for further human resources if that will enable the European Union to shoulder its responsibilities. The Commission proposals, moreover, are aimed at simplifying and speeding up procedures under the new regulation, even though removing from the outset individual States’ ability to supervise projects would not necessarily be the best solution to achieve greater transparency. More credit should be provided for smaller-scale projects. Too frequently I meet people who have extensive experience of the local association movement, who feel let down by the procedures they have to follow in order to receive subsidies. The Euro-Mediterranean partnership can only really be built by and for the general public, who themselves wish to achieve a partnership that is of real benefit to all citizens. The MEDA programme also raises fundamental questions about our Euro-Mediterranean policy in general. First and foremost, cooperation is concentrated essentially in the economic and financial dimensions and marginalises the social and cultural dimensions. It is also time that we took greater account of the growing dissatisfaction with the practices of out-and-out free trade. The social consequences we are seeing in the free trade area are cause for deep concerns, which cannot be ignored. The social budgets of southern countries risk seeing the budgetary resources raised from customs duties cut to a dangerous level. The growth in competition could eat away at the industrial fabric of these countries, which in some cases consists of vulnerable small and medium-sized enterprises. Rather than so-called ‘accompanying’ measures, the economic systems in the South need real technological support. The purpose of aid, furthermore, should be not only to convert businesses to comply with the criteria of profitability, but also to respond to the employment needs of the population. While private sector development is heavily supported by MEDA, the public sector is largely forgotten, even though it responds to genuine needs. To conclude, I should like to concentrate on two aspects of the reports which I support: really encouraging the participation… (The President cut the speaker off)

Mr President, whatever the value of the euro, the primary objective of the European Central Bank, as you have reminded us, Mr Duisenberg, is to maintain price stability without worrying about the economic and social consequences which come in the wake of these decisions. That is why the ECB can increase its interest rates, at the risk of slowing down investment and dampening growth. This hike follows on from the increase in American rates. The persistent weakness of the euro against the dollar is also the result of the huge drain on capital leaving the European Union. According to experts, nearly 950 billion French francs net poured out of the euro zone in 1999 in the form of direct investments abroad, i.e. 43% more than in 1998. In short, the euro is used mainly for borrowing in order to finance speculative projects, even as far away as the United States. The decision to compete with the United States by promoting the financial markets leads up a blind alley. It needs a boom in employment, training, research and salaries to enable us to develop a resolutely modern European social model. To do so, social and monetary sides must join forces. But the ECB is the only master on board when it comes to monetary policy. In the name of the fight against inflation and strict compliance with the Stability Pact, it even goes so far as to call the governments of the Member States to order, but never has a word to say in criticism of the speculation sweeping the financial markets. It advocates wage restraint, flexibility and job insecurity. It fans the flames of privatisation in order to boost competitiveness and the return on capital. It also advocates ‘modernising’ social protection and reducing unemployment costs, thus applying the same logic as the agreement in France between employers and two trades union, an agreement which punishes the unemployed and makes them feel guilty. We must re-open the debate on the remit of the European Central Bank in order to find a new credit policy which takes account of employment criteria. We cannot merely tack a social chapter on to neo-liberal economic policy. The alternative in a truly social Europe would be to substitute a growth, employment and training pact for the stability pact. And if we are to implement this approach, it is vital that we strengthen control of the ECB by the European Parliament and the national parliaments.

 Mr President, 58 Chinese immigrants who arrived at Dover, in the hope of a better life, have died in horrific conditions, surrounded by crates of tomatoes. I, like all of you, am deeply shocked. This crime, however, is a daily occurrence at European Union borders. Let us not forget Yagine and Fodé, the two boys from Guinea, who wanted to see Brussels last summer. Since the beginning of this year alone, dozens of young people from the Maghreb have drowned trying to reach the Spanish coast. Fourteen Kurds died of asphyxiation in the hold of a burning ship in Patras. Dozens of Albanians and Tunisians die en route to Italy. These are terrifying figures. They should be unacceptable in a European Union that prides itself on being based on the protection of human rights. How then, can we put an end to this? That is the question. The debate that has opened as a result of the Dover tragedy has focused on the traffic in human beings and the eradication of the mafias that organise the criminal networks. The trade in smuggling human beings is undeniably flourishing. For a long time, we have known about the existence of criminal networks, such as the Chinese Triads, who make huge profits by transporting desperate people to countries that they are led to believe are paradises.  Mafia networks must therefore be harshly punished, but so must the people who exploit illegal labour, since no immigration networks exist without economic networks. As a result, in France, Chinese illegal immigrants are forced to work for years in sweat-shops to pay for their journey. These modern-day slaves supply a cheap labour force to whole sectors of the economy, and bosses are therefore free to move them around, even within the European Union.  The dogma of liberal globalisation has magnified the free movement of goods and capital, but is seeking to stop the free movement of people. Emigration, whether it is a result of political oppression or poverty, merely reflects global inequalities. It is a symptom of the ever-widening gulf that separates North and South, and the incentive to emigrate is all the stronger since images of Western prosperity are invading the screens of the third world.  It is true that the free movement established by the European Union is a fundamental right, but this is reserved for its own nationals. Nationals of third countries have seen their movement littered with traps, as a result of the Schengen agreement and the mirage of zero immigration. All of these factors have simply created new forms of illegal immigration.  A purely repressive European response to the issue of immigration would certainly consolidate Europe’s fortification mechanism, but this would be ignoring the most fundamental aspect, which is the uniting of efforts and sharing at global level. A seminar is certainly a good idea, Minister, but it should cover a common immigration policy based on the principle of freedom of movement, improving rights…  (The President cut the speaker off)

 Mr President, I should like first of all to welcome Moncef Marzouhi, spokesman for the National Council for Liberties in Tunisia, and Khemmaïs Ksila, from the Tunisian League for Human Rights, who are present in this Chamber. Commissioner, Mr President-in-Office of the Council, I, together with other Members of this Parliament, have spared no effort to ensure that this debate was held. Why should we discuss Tunisia? This is not a question of interference, as that country’s future is in the hands of its citizens. What we wish to do is open people’s eyes to the hidden reality of Tunisia and to shoulder the responsibilities that are incumbent on the European Union, which is linked to that country by an association agreement that was signed five years ago now. The hunger strike by the journalist Taoufik Ben Brik lifted a corner of the veil that conceals the lack of press freedom and the persecution of the men and women with alternative views to those of the regime of President Ben Ali. No, Tunisia is not the smiling land trumpeted in the advertisements aimed at the 4 million European tourists who go there every year. Tunisia also comprises militants fighting for human rights, women fighting for democracy, students who are spied on, harassed, and deprived of their telephones, passports, sometimes even of the freedom to travel within Tunisian territory. An administrative action, which, on the face of it, is quite commonplace, becomes a genuine political fight. This is what happens, for example, to the militants of RAID, the Tunisian branch of the ATTAC movement – the Association for the Taxation of Financial Transactions for the Aid of Citizens – whose association is not allowed to exist, and three of whose members have been held in prison. Tunisia has also become a judicial system that is controlled from above. Militants are imprisoned and tortured. I still remember the suffering endured by young Nourredine, whom I met when four of us visited Tunis a month ago. Nourredine was tortured and kept in prison for more than 20 months simply for having organised a strike at the university.   Fortunately, in the last few weeks, several prisoners have been released and passports have been returned. In short, I would like to see the Tunisian authorities express the will to take account of the calls for democracy. If measurable progress is to be made, however, more must be done, much more. Hundreds of prisoners of conscience, who are locked up in intolerable conditions, must be released. Organisations that are not recognised, such as the RAID and the TNLF, must be decriminalised, and the cases against the three leaders of the RAID, whose trial will be held on 27 June, must be dropped. Let us therefore not weaken in our support for those who are taking action to condemn a police state. The desire for freedom has, moreover, become so unbearable to some parties that they, sometimes with violence, try to prevent public meetings about freedom in Tunisia, even in France. I witnessed this myself around a week ago in Paris. Such acts within the European Union itself are quite unacceptable. We must therefore point out that the association agreement, which contains a clause on respecting human rights, the non-observance of which can lead to suspension, is not being respected today. I urge all honourable Members to vote in favour of the compromise resolution and I particularly urge the Council and the Commission to implement all the methods provided for in the agreement to ensure that democratic freedoms are respected, by involving civil society and preparing if needs be, for this agreement to be suspended.  To conclude, the economic policy set by the Tunisian government, which gives liberal experts the impression that it is a model student, is under threat from various social forces. The partnership proposed by the European Union, which is essentially based on free trade, is liable to exacerbate the harmful effects on the population to the extent that, as the parliamentary delegation for relations with the Maghreb noted, the association agreement is considered to be harmful by all Tunisian organisations, in both the public and the private sectors. I therefore urge the Commission to review the European Union’s Mediterranean policy in the light of its economic and social consequences for the Tunisian economy and for employment there.

 The external debt of the developing countries poses a major challenge. The 50 poorest countries spend twice as much servicing their debt as they receive in aid. The UNCTAD report on sub-Saharan Africa shows that African countries have not received any benefit from structural adjustment programmes for over ten years. The proposal is very restrictive and is limited to the poorest, highly indebted countries. It imposes far too many conditions on the countries requiring debt relief. I regret any conditions which are imposed, particularly any link between debt relief and the application of structural adjustment measures. This is why I have abstained from the vote on the motion for a resolution. I am in favour of very substantial debt relief for all the countries concerned and debt cancellation for the poorest ones.

 Mr President, the Euro-Mediterranean Partnership launched in 1995 has broken down. It is official. The relaunch of this policy announced by the forthcoming French presidency of the European Union bodes well, since the countries in this region have to face extensive and urgent challenges. In order to respond effectively to these, it is crucial that the interests of the peoples around this central sea are truly taken into consideration, and that the people participate actively in the partnership. Let me say from the outset that the time has come to change the course of Euro-Mediterranean policy. First of all, the objective of a policy of this type must be to tackle the blatant disparities between the northern and southern shores of the Mediterranean, which keep the peoples of the south in an explosive economic and social situation. Poverty, a high level of illiteracy, massive unemployment, particularly among young people, extreme inequalities and an increasing technological deficit compared to Western countries. There are considerable infrastructure needs, not to mention environmental challenges. The effect of this widening gap can only be to increasingly foster the most violent forms of nationalism, fundamentalism and war. Indeed, the weight of foreign debt, the drop in the prices of raw materials and structural adjustment plans have already forced these countries to adopt swingeing austerity programmes and have wrecked their capacity for development. The prospect of a free trade area, a sort of regional MAI, is liable to dangerously exacerbate these power struggles. Studies show that two thirds of Tunisian industry would not survive the opening of frontiers. The slowdown in the process indeed stems as much from the deadlock in the Near-East peace process as from the many concerns expressed increasingly overtly: for instance, the first Euro-Mediterranean trade union conference held a year ago which highlighted the complete absence of the social dimension. There are, however, advantages to establishing things from scratch. Citizens, NGOs and trade unions are committed on a day-to-day basis to supporting solidarity between peoples and to putting many local cooperation projects into practice. The Euro-Mediterranean process thus calls for a pooling of resources which should be advantageous to all concerned in moving towards a common area of prosperity, which was the objective set in Barcelona. There are many possible ways out of the dogma of free trade that was challenged in Seattle. It is more than time to wipe out the debt of the countries of the South, and to engage in technology transfer and cooperation in the areas of training between public services. I should finally like to say that, besides working towards peace in the Middle East, which the European Union must continue to strive for, I am just as keen to seeing Europe play a much more active part in ensuring that the referendum on self-determination in the Western Sahara, which is under serious threat, is held in the conditions stipulated under UN authority. The credibility of European foreign policy is at stake here.

 Mr President, Commissioner, as all chocolate-lovers know, proper chocolate is made from cocoa butter. The addition of any other fats spoils the flavour. Indeed the 1973 directive, which prohibited the use of vegetable fats other than cocoa butter, was intended to safeguard this quality. With the inclusion of new countries in the European Union, some derogations to this strict ban came to be granted. Harmonisation was essential in the name of the free movement of goods. The Commission then had the choice of setting the European standard at the maximum quality level and extending the ban to all Member States but, under pressure from multinational companies wishing to reduce their production costs, in April 1996 the Commission proposed a directive authorising the addition of a minimum level of vegetable fats. At first reading, Parliament got involved in a dangerous procedure of accepting the directive subject to certain conditions. The Council leapt into the breach, adopting its common position, which recognises the designation ‘chocolate’ even for products with other vegetable fats added. Once again we see the concept of profits for the few triumph over quality for all. At second reading, however, the European Parliament can thwart this directive which would have serious implications if it were applied. Both consumers and small specialist chocolate-makers would suffer a reduction in quality and standards would be reduced to the lowest level. ACP cocoa-producing countries would experience a considerable reduction in their market and their income. This would involve more than USD 300 million for the Ivory Coast alone. To say that they are extremely worried is an understatement. Out of concern for the interests of consumers and the ACP countries, the great majority of my Group is in favour of banning the use of vegetable fats in order to safeguard the authenticity and the quality of real chocolate. We have therefore tabled a motion to reject the Council’s common position. The small specialist chocolate-makers came to warn Members of Parliament at January’s part-session in Strasbourg. So, I ask all the Members who declared their solidarity with them to support our motion.

 Madam President, my Group is extremely delighted that this debate is taking place today, particularly as we have spared no effort along with Members of other groups to bring this about. Obviously we all have different approaches which is demonstrated by our debate and the motions for a resolution tabled at the beginning. Having said this, our Group is pleased about the step forward which the compromise motion represents. This invites the Commission to present a report within six months. The European Parliament can play its role by taking the initiative, even if it does so timidly, on this subject. However, I agree with the previous speaker that, if paragraph 9 were challenged, this motion would clearly lose its substance. This debate concerns a vital question which increasing numbers of people are legitimately raising. What are the respective places of people and finance in today’s economy? USD 1 800 billion is the volume of money moved every day in the world’s currency markets. This represents over a quarter of the annual global volume of trade in goods and services. By putting finance at the helm, this has reinforced the demands of profitability and toughened the operating conditions everywhere. It has led to a growth in mergers, acquisitions and company restructuring and to gigantic sums being raised with increasing frequency on the financial markets. Unemployment and pressure on employees worldwide is increasing. Openings and real growth are being hampered and the sudden influx or withdrawal of speculative capital is threatening the economies of many countries, to the point of collapse, as in Asia, Russia and Brazil. Faced with this neoliberal globalisation dominated by the financial markets, demand, as our motion recognises, is developing from a different idea of the world in which common law stipulates a duty of solidarity in an increasingly interdependent world. No one can ignore the challenge to civilisation posed by the lack of nearly one billion jobs and the need to make unprecedented efforts in terms of development and access to information. In this respect, all ideas deserve to be considered, including the Tobin tax which is important, just like other forms of transaction which may be envisaged. This tax could help to check speculation without penalising the activities of the real economy. It could release new resources for investment in people and, at a time when the UNDP estimates the sum needed to eradicate poverty to be USD 40 billion per year, it could allow access for everyone to drinking water and satisfy health needs. When the debate on the ability of politics to influence economics goes global, the establishment of this tax could become one of the symbols of the political desire to recapture the democratic areas seized by the international financial operators. The Commissioner has said that a minimum number of industrialised countries would be needed to achieve this. I would point out that the European Union is composed of a large number of industrialised countries and, like Mr Désir and several other speakers, I feel that the European Union which we are forming can take the initiative in this respect. In any case, the European Parliament would be honoured to take up the call of the people to control the world in order to achieve a sense of well-being for everyone.

 Mr President, in 1998 the European Commission started a procedure intended to conclude a cross-border book price agreement between Germany and Austria. Through this procedure, which was based on respect for European competition rules, the Commission was actually aiming to challenge the fixed book price system. Among other benefits, this system allows literary production to be supported and the survival of small publishing houses and bookshops to be assured. The European Parliament reacted strongly by adopting virtually unanimously, on 20 November 1998, a resolution which defended fixed book prices and which called on the Commission to bring its Community policy on book price agreements into line with cultural requirements. Under pressure from the French and German Governments, the Council used Parliament’s position to adopt a resolution on 8 February 1999 demanding, in particular, the continuation of the existing fixed book price systems. The steadfastness shown by the Council and Parliament led the Commission to acknowledge that competition rules could not be systematically applied in the book sector. It therefore confirmed that it had no intention of challenging the contractual agreements concluded in certain Member States or national laws such as the Lange Act in France. Nevertheless, some months later, and after the installation of the new Commission, the Directorate-General for Competition is once again pushing the Commission to act against cross-border agreements and fixed book prices. Faced with this new offensive by the Commission, which is bent on deregulation, it was important to react very quickly. I am therefore delighted about this debate and the new position being taken by the European Parliament on this issue. In its motion for a resolution, my group stresses that books are primarily cultural assets and must not therefore be subject to the competition rules in the same way as all other goods. Their unique nature must be fully recognised in the context of the EU’s cultural policy which we are trying to develop. This is why we hope that Parliament will confirm its position of November 1998 in order to defend cross-border agreements and fixed book prices. Why will the Commission not take up our proposal to extend the fixed book price system to all Member States? In order to take account of technological developments, the directive on e-commerce should also include the requirements indicated by the various national laws on fixed book prices to prevent this system from being circumvented. To conclude, I hope that the Council will show the same steadfastness as this House in protecting and promoting the fixed book price system. This system, as noted by our motion for a resolution, is better than any other at improving the production and distribution of literary works without eliminating competition.

 Mr President, why has the situation of women in Afghanistan been raised in this debate on topical and urgent subjects of major importance? The answer is that, although discrimination against women has become a common problem in today’s world, the discrimination being experienced by women in Afghanistan is unique and without precedent. This is the explanation given by one of the courageous women who is standing up and telling the world about this abominable situation. There is therefore no doubt about the urgency of this issue and this has been the case since 1996. Terror and fanaticism have swept through Afghanistan since the arrival of the Taliban. Women are their bête noire and the hatred which they have unleashed against them is expressed in inhuman violence. All females, including young girls, are subject to a strict regime of segregation. They have no freedom of speech, no access to healthcare and no right to work. They are forced to cover themselves from head to toe which is like living in a walking prison. They can be beaten in the street simply for not covering their faces and hair correctly. In addition to physical cruelty, there is every evidence that almost all the women living in Afghanistan are subject to psychological pressures which are leading them to depression and suicide. This situation can only get worse because girls are not allowed to be educated beyond the age of nine. The direct consequences on all children are terrible for one child in five is dying before the age of five. These conditions are even less acceptable given that, in the past, Afghan women participated in public life as students, professionals, officials or even parliamentarians. This treatment, which is impossible for a human being to even conceive, is not a religious issue or a question of cultural tradition, as some would have us believe. It is a barbaric system which forces women into a sub-human status. We must react against this apartheid. We must stop these fanatics who are greedy for power and secretly supported not only by the regime in Pakistan and its Koranic schools but also, unfortunately, by American services. Several women’s organisations have been calling for some time for all the countries of the world to increase pressure on the Taliban. The UN and the European Union have rightly made their aid conditional on respect for human rights. As indicated in the motion for a resolution which, like Mrs Morgantini, I ask you to support en masse, I call on the Council not to recognise any regime in Afghanistan until sexual discrimination is eliminated. The Council must be more active and at least as active as it was with regard to Bin Laden. NGOs are also present in part of the country. We must help them and ensure that a proper action plan is implemented to support their work. We must also help the Afghan women who are in Europe organising themselves. They must receive our support and help. (Applause)

Turkey’s application for membership of the European Union will probably be on the agenda of the next European Council meeting in Helsinki. There is a strong movement developing, particularly in France, for Turkey to be recognised as having candidate country status on an equal footing with the other applicant countries for enlargement. I should like to draw your attention to the risk of finding ourselves in the same situation as with the Customs Union. According to those promoting it, the Customs Union between the European Union and Turkey should favour democratic reforms, human rights and the rights of minorities. Against the opinion of our Group and many human rights associations such as “France Liberté”
, which is chaired by Danielle Mitterrand, the Customs Union has been ratified and implemented. Today we are discussing dealing with it in greater depth. We have no choice but to note that human rights violations have continued. The problem of the Kurds has still not been resolved. The fact that Öçalan has been condemned to death has been confirmed. Leyla Zana is still in prison. The European Commission itself has been obliged to acknowledge that since the implementation of Customs Union, no significant progress has been made in Turkey in the field of human rights and democratic reform.  Let us learn from the experience of the Customs Union. Encouraging Turkey’s “attachment to Europe”, as Jacques Chirac put it in Istanbul on 18 November, by recognising Turkey as a candidate country will be taken by the Turkish authorities as encouragement to continue the same policy.  I do not propose to rule out Turkey’s application to join the European Union for good, but we must first require of Turkey firm and definitive commitments and check that they are observed: the recognition of the rights of the Kurdish people, the abolition of the death penalty and a new judgement for Öçalan, the release of Leyla Zana and of all political prisoners and the application of United Nations resolutions to resolve the Cyprus problem. The report by the Committee on Foreign Affairs, Human Rights, Common Security and Defence Policy takes care to refer to the matter of human rights, but, after having amended the Commission proposal, it comes out in favour of continuing and increasing the Customs Union with Turkey. I cannot approve this step because it is time to send a clear signal to Turkey by blocking or suspending the implementation of the Customs Union.

 Mr President, energy is at the heart of any economic or social activity. All citizens are affected by the supply, transportation and distribution of energy. There is still a lot to be done to ensure that the right to energy is a reality everywhere, both in the poorest countries and in industrialised countries, where all classes of the population do not have access on equal terms: needs are not therefore being satisfied and energy-related issues are becoming crucial. The European Union is still highly dependent on energy. CO2 emissions have not yet been stabilised and energy sources have not yet been diversified. Designing an energy policy which respects the environment therefore requires determined effort. In this respect, the fifth UN Conference on Climate Change has just confirmed the divergences between those with pro-active policies and those who are continually attempting to circumvent the Kyoto targets. The European Union is itself undertaking to ratify the Kyoto Protocol by the year 2002 and is campaigning for measures which are different for developing countries and for industrialised countries. Its CO2 emissions were reduced by 19% in 1997. In this way it may contribute, I believe, to preventing the Americans’ exclusively commercial liberal concept gaining the day, a concept which goes as far as to call into question the Kyoto targets. Yet, Europe has not made sufficient effort, and there is no guaranteed response to all these challenges. There is, therefore, cause for concern in the fact that the Commission and the Council continue to regard opening the energy market to free competition as an essential phase. As the Chichester report indeed observes, there is a contradiction between liberalisation and the reduction of CO2 emissions. But this is not the only contradiction. Market pressure is also exerted on public service tasks: the most effective centres of resistance to unbridled free competition and public enterprises are under threat. Furthermore, the call for competition restricts the capacity of States to intervene in energy policy choices and to guarantee equal access for users. Energy is not like other goods for sale and must be treated as a special case. Greater cooperation and the coordination of national policies are required, not an integrated European policy. Finally, the rapporteur is astonished, rightly so, that the Commission makes no mention whatsoever of nuclear energy even though it contributes towards reducing CO2 emissions, even if this energy should be safer and more environmentally friendly. Such key issues merit extensive public debate, enabling everyone to come to terms with the challenges and choices involved in energy policy.

Mr President, it is high time that we adopted a universal moratorium on the death penalty, that true administrative murder, as Albert Camus called it. This is the purpose of our resolution directed at the General Assembly of the United Nations. Like my colleague, I would like to devote a few words to the urgency with which we must intervene to save Moumia Abou Jamal. Moumia is the black American journalist who was sentenced to death in 1982 after a police set-up and a rigged trial. The Supreme Court has just rejected his appeal. Having spent 17 years on death row, Moumia is now at the mercy of an execution order which the Governor of Pennsylvania can legally sign at any time. At a time when an American study has revealed racial disparity in the application of the death penalty in Philadelphia, the American Government should be noble enough to make a stand against this flagrant violation of the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights. The shock that this produced in public opinion and the resulting powerful international mobilisation, in which this Parliament took full part, already prevented the implementation of the first execution order, signed on 2 June 1995. Today the threat is serious. It is urgent. The person who is known as the voice of the voiceless and the peacemaker is in danger. Any stand, demonstration or resolution will help to prevent the irreversible, and may prevent that voice from being silenced.

 Mr President, I would like to thank Mrs Kinnock for her report. The agreement between the European Union and South Africa, which we are debating today, is of great importance. I am all the more favourable towards it because the Council stalled the negotiations at the beginning of the year, which sent out a very bad sign to the South African people. In February 1999, our House expressed its failure to understand this rejection, even if the interests of certain European agricultural producers had to be taken into account. This could have been done though, without threatening the discussions in their entirety. Parliament’s urgent appeal was obviously heard, because the Council finally approved the agreement. I am also pleased that at the insistence of the South Africans, the agreement was extended to cover development cooperation, too. What we have to do now is to follow very closely the way the agreement is applied to ensure that its most positive aspects contribute to the development of the new South Africa. Although it is a “rich country” in one of the poorest continents, relations within society there are still very unevenly balanced, to the extent that the UNDP ranks this country 93rd in its human development index. 52% of annual income goes to only 10% of the population, and unemployment rose from 30% in 1994 to 37% in 1997. These disparities reflect the racial divisions which still exist. To sum up the situation, and this is what South Africans themselves say, “Apartheid has been defeated in political terms, but it is still very much present in the daily life of millions of people, in economic and social terms.” There is a noticeable, justifiable impatience, particularly among the black population.  Having showed our solidarity with the movement for freedom from the harsh apartheid regime, we must now support the unprecedented efforts which have led to the RDP. Substantial advances have already been made in providing schooling for children, local medical services, access to drinking water and to electricity. Nevertheless, a great deal still remains to be done. This agreement means all the more to me because, after years of going on demonstrations for the release of Nelson Mandela, I had the privilege of going to South Africa on the day after he was elected President.  Finally, we must listen to those expressing their concern about the consequences of free trade. South Africa’s preference was from the outset for an agreement close to the measures of the Lomé Convention, and Unctad predicts an unequal impact on the bilateral movements of trade to the detriment of South African products. Also, concerns and fears at a regional level in the countries within the Southern African Customs Union have not been given sufficient consideration. Botswana, Lesotho, Namibia and Swaziland will be losing a major source of revenue as the entry into force of the agreement will lead to a dramatic fall in the level of the sums currently raised by customs duties in their Union. In addition to this, the appearance on their market of produce subsidised by the CAP will represent a real threat to their agriculture. The agreement that we are discussing is of strategic importance for both parties. It is also of strategic importance for the peace, stability and development of Southern Africa. As well as giving my approval, I would like to finish by putting forward a proposal. Perhaps we could hold hearings in Parliament for the ambassadors of Southern African countries in order to involve them directly in these new relations between the European Union and this part of the world, which is so crucial to the future of the whole African continent.
