Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, the single market has become a matter of course for our citizens. Who can fail to remember with amusement the judgment of 1979 on Cassis de Dijon or the banana war with the United States? As we look at global trade wars or disputes, the European single market appears as a mainstay of the European philosophy: no barriers, no discrimination, legal certainty and fair competition.  Nevertheless, in the interplay between the global economic powers we, the European Union, must continue to safeguard the rights of consumers and SMEs and protect consumers against new dangers, for example, chemical substances or new, creative tricks by vendors, such as exist in the financial market. We social democrats support the Commission in its measures against dominant practices and unfair competition, regardless of who is involved, even when this applies to Microsoft or Google, to German energy companies or Gazprom. We must also observe Jacques Delors’s third point more closely: the single market also means solidarity, which unites. Barbara Weiler  (S&amp;D

 Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, I would like to thank the rapporteur and, above all, the whole team of shadow rapporteurs, for producing these proposals, which we will adopt tomorrow. Much has already been said about the benefits of standards. I would like to mention two further examples that we think are self-evident: the universal charger for mobile phones and, in future, the realisation of electromobility. Without standards, these things would absolutely not be possible. Unfortunately, not all of society knows how standards are produced. It is not this House – and nor will it be in future – it is national, European and international institutes like CEN and CENELEC that produce standards. The last 25 years has been a good period, but there were also a number of shortcomings, which we have now tidied up. The creation of standards was far too slow, far too expensive, too opaque and too unilateral in terms of participation. We have now rectified that with this proposal, and we will make access cheaper for small and medium-sized enterprises, too, we will involve the trade unions and the social partners, the consumer organisations, and we will link up with national, international and European bodies. I am also pleased about the sensible involvement in procurement. As a final point, I will deal with acceptance. This is something that we will still have to test out and check the state thereof. Germany’s DIN institute had serious concerns at the start of the debate about the direction that acceptance was moving in. I believe those concerns have since been resolved. The SME sector in Hesse, for example, has already provided me with feedback. I found out that it is pleased with this compromise, with this proposal from the rapporteur and the Committee on the Internal Market and Consumer Protection, and that it sees a series of improvements for the future.

 Madam President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, in the past week, I had the honour of speaking about the 20th anniversary of the completion of the internal market at a Franco-German partnership celebration. It was interesting to see how the guests reacted to this. They took it all for granted, and indeed it is good that citizens consider this something that goes without saying. The four fundamental freedoms are the core of the European Union, and I hope that we, as Parliament, will fight all joint attempts to erect new barriers and new borders, such as when the German Government and the former French Government attempted to erect new barriers, because the freedom of movement of our citizens is at least as important to us as the freedom of movement of capital or goods. In my view, Mr Busuttil has presented a good and helpful report. The internal market scoreboard, SOLVIT and other instruments are useful for establishing whether the governments really want European laws and whether the deficits are actually being reduced, as the Council has in fact agreed. We want the internal market to be simplified for consumers. We want SMEs to have easier access and we want all our citizens to profit from it. Interestingly, transposition is not always related to the size of the country. As has already been mentioned, Malta comes out best; Belgium, unfortunately, has not done so well. Mr Busuttil, your motion is also interesting and I have great sympathy for you, but I must point out that there are a few other demands in your report that already incorporate this, such as Article 18 on transparency, or Article 24, in which we call for correlation tables, or even Article 21, which suggests that the European Court of Justice could work more quickly. So perhaps we should work on this first. On behalf of the Group of the Progressive Alliance of Socialists and Democrats in the European Parliament, I should like to highlight four further aspects. Firstly, the transposition must be correct; that is, it does not have to be gold-plated, but it must not be lax and inadequate. Mr Chatzimarkakis, if I may have your ear for a moment: the two liberal camps in the national German Government are currently dabbling with the Payment Services Directive, and from what I have heard, initial reports are not encouraging. Now for my second point, which is that the internal market is also a way of overcoming the crisis, creates jobs and contributes to growth. Thirdly, we consider the procedures for the social protection of workers to be too cumbersome, because as far as we are concerned – and this is my only criticism, Commissioner Barnier – social cohesion is dealt with too briefly in this report. We will insist on this, because we have a long tradition of social cohesion. Finally, I would like to quote your former colleague, Jacques Delors, who said that the internal market works according to three principles: competition which stimulates, cooperation which strengthens and solidarity which unites.

 Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I would like to talk about the European Development Fund (EDF), and I am confident that we will be able to reach agreement in this area, not only in committee, but also in plenary. This debate – and this is surely also important to mention – is taking place under the very particular circumstances of the hard times of economic and financial crisis within the European Union and, essentially, also worldwide. That is precisely why the attention of the general public is also on our debate here concerning discharge and the review of the budget. After all, we all actually want the budget to be correctly implemented and for it to be meaningful and, above all – I mention this with regard to the EDF in particular – sustainable, too. The EDF is our most important instrument for reducing poverty, that is to say, in the best interests of the European Union, for preventing wars and also for giving people prospects for the future. I am absolutely convinced that that is also the way the citizens and taxpayers see it. The Social Democrats support the report that we voted on in committee, although this was only after our amendments had been adopted and the report took a slightly different direction, as meaningful and necessary criticism is only right and proper. However, as Ms Herczog already mentioned, an attempt at politicisation is being made here, for example, with regard to the criticism of the United Nations. It goes without saying that the UN must improve its efficiency and, in particular, become more transparent. However, it is also an important partner for our work and it has useful infrastructure. We must, in any case, provide training in our offices and increase capacity, as that is the only way to work efficiently. That is something I would like to emphasise and, to conclude, I would like to state that we need a common assessment of the error rate and, of course, also a different agricultural policy.

 Mr President, Baroness Ashton, ladies and gentlemen, Ms Oomen-Ruijten, your speech has made it clear to me that the Members who recently visited Myanmar together with me and Mr Langen as part of a delegation from the Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN) have a rather different view. It is no longer possible to say that the regime is still a junta. There are moves under way towards democracy that we have experienced at first hand and seen the effects of. I believe that everyone who has been involved in the introduction of democracy on the ground in Myanmar has been impressed, relieved and filled with enthusiasm. In my opinion, this is particularly true in the light of the debate that we have just held and the developments in Syria, Mali and Egypt. What can the EU do to ensure that this process continues in Myanmar? Sympathy alone is not enough. We need to share responsibility for further development aid projects and give them our support. We should encourage the ASEAN countries and, in particular, Myanmar’s neighbour, Thailand, to continue helping, as they have already done for a long period. However, we also need to lift the sanctions. The following comment recently appeared in a newspaper: Myanmar is a gold mine with huge quantities of raw materials, gas and oil, and all of this is now available. The estimate is that growth will reach a level of 6%. We must also help to ensure – not alone, but the EU is partly responsible for this – that the growth and the wealth in what is still, in part, a very poor country does not end up in the capitals of America, Europe and China, but reaches the population. Only then will there be stable, peaceful and democratic long-term development in the country. Barbara Weiler,

 Mr President, Commissioners, ladies and gentlemen, Malaysia is a wonderful country with age-old traditions and cultural riches. As members of the ASEAN delegation, we have frequently seen for ourselves how quickly and remarkably this country has grown. The resulting increase in economic power has led to Malaysia achieving top ten ranking when it comes to world growth rates, a fact that has greatly impressed us. It is for this reason that I would like to state on behalf of my own group, the Group of the Progressive Alliance of Socialists and Democrats in the European Parliament, as well as all those here who signed the resolution, that we find it impossible to understand why Malaysia still practises this outmoded method of chastisement, which harkens back to the country’s colonial past and which seems almost mediaeval to us in Europe. We are not alone in voicing this criticism: lawyers in Malaysia itself are equally opposed to the practice. Caning violates all United Nations human rights agreements and we believe that things need to change quickly. We welcomed the charter of the ASEAN states, which emphasises in several articles and the preamble that – and I quote – ‘the promotion and protection of human rights’ is among the essential requirements of the ASEAN Charter, which has also been ratified by Malaysia. Malaysia has long espoused democratic principles. However, this also involves the rule of law with universal standards. This is something we shall repeat again and again when we are in Malaysia and the ASEAN states, and the European Parliament will underline this with this resolution. Barbara Weiler,  
rapporteur

 Madam President, President-in-Office of the Council, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, first of all, I would like to thank the team of shadow rapporteurs from the Committee on Legal Affairs and the Committee on Industry, Research and Energy, my colleagues and everyone who contributed to this splendid result. Without constructive and fair cooperation with the Commission and with the Belgian Presidency, we would certainly not have achieved this result. As rapporteur, I am – as you can imagine – very pleased with the result, firstly because we have made significant improvements in relation to the old directive, and secondly because we have introduced new ways to encourage better payment practices. We have achieved the goal. Well, I would prefer to say that the course has been set for improving the liquidity of SMEs, the small and medium-sized enterprises, and for securing investments in new products, new jobs and new processes. Why was it necessary to improve this directive? The legislation from 2000 was non-binding and not very efficient. In recent years, payment practices in almost all Member States have deteriorated, and this happened even before the financial and economic crisis. The reform was also requested by the small businesses that expressed their wishes within the framework of the Small Business Act. They wanted payment practices in Europe to be organised in a considerably more efficient manner. With regard to the results, I can say, firstly, that we have trodden a new path. We have strict rules. As a matter of principle, invoices must be paid within 30 days with few exceptions, and these must be justified. We have introduced a higher late payment interest rate of 8%. We have set the recovery costs at a completely non-bureaucratic fixed amount of EUR 40, and we have made it easier than it was previously for small businesses to assert their rights. The second aspect to the new path, however, is the positive incentives and the new instruments, for example, the naming of customers with good payment practices, more information provided to small businesses concerning their rights, payment in instalments and the promotion of alternative dispute resolution mechanisms. This legislation is also part of the ‘better regulation’ approach and it will also apply to the EU institutions. We are particularly proud of this, because – as I am sure you can imagine – not everyone was enthusiastic about it. Of course, there were a few conflicts and I would like to mention some of these. Firstly, to start with, there were certainly major differences and a diversity of opinions in Parliament. The 100 amendments alone demonstrate that we first had to tussle together over this in Parliament, too. The Commission was certainly not always happy with our endeavours, including the extension of this to the business to business level, but I think that, overall, we have achieved a good result. It was the Council that posed the problems. It is regrettable that the Council has not always fulfilled its objective of helping small businesses. I find that particularly regrettable for the relatively rich and well-structured countries like Germany and Austria. With regard to the professional organisations, I can only say that they were constructive, even though we, naturally, did not always accept or were not always able to go with their opinions. In summary, the next steps are that, after tomorrow’s vote, we expect the Council to conduct a final positive vote and then the Member States will be able to implement this legislation. We do not expect it to take two years for this to be implemented. Instead, we expect the Member States to begin to transpose it into national law as early as January of next year. Barbara Weiler,  
rapporteur.

Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, when we discuss this matter back home in our electoral districts, I believe we will all find that we receive a great deal of support – something that is not a foregone conclusion where European dossiers are concerned – because this issue of late payment as a whole is not merely criticised back home; it is considered by everyone to be a given that payments should be made on time. That is the case irrespective of which party someone belongs to, and it is not dependent on what branch of industry you talk to, either. So we have broad agreement. I would also like to thank my fellow Members who have indicated their agreement with this result this evening. I would like to mention three more aspects. As I said at the beginning of the debate, we will set the wheels in motion tomorrow. However, we will have to look very closely at whether the relaxations that we have introduced for micro-businesses, for agricultural undertakings, for example, and for artisan companies, are actually sufficient to enable these enterprises to obtain the money they are owed. We will have to examine very carefully how the limited freedom of contract will work. That is something new in the European internal market that we are now going to try out and that all of us also more or less support. We will need to examine whether the 8% late payment interest rate is adequate; Parliament would have liked it to be 9%. We will see how it works, and I would like to ask the Commission to pay close attention in order to ensure that, during the process of implementation, the Member States do not water down the directive. I also see definite success on the horizon. I have heard that Spain has already produced new national legislation following our methods, and I know that the same is true of other Member States. In any case, our Committee will monitor the situation or carry out an impact assessment according to a directive, so that the Member States also know that, when the parliamentary term comes to an end, we will know who has implemented the improved payment practices as we intended and who has not. I would like to thank everyone who has contributed to this result, including the Belgian Presidency, which has perhaps not received enough recognition for its contribution. We know how efficiently and constructively you conducted the negotiations – a small country, but I would say a country with very intelligent and efficient methods for achieving results in Europe.

 Mr President, representatives of the Commission and, above all, the Council, ladies and gentlemen, we hear this every year in the debate on improvements in the implementation of the distribution of European funds: more accurate and more efficient control of expenditure in all bodies and institutions, more transparency for Parliament and also for citizens. The presence today of the Council is the first indication that something is changing in the Council as well. Marvellous, we are pleased – as you have heard – but that is certainly not enough for us. It is precisely the difference that you mentioned – you believe you have created complete transparency, while we believe you have not yet answered our questions from the debate at the end of November – that shows that we are not yet cooperating with each other as well as we should be. You spoke of the 1970 agreement that you want to amend and develop. That is all well and good, but this expectation of ours is hardly new. We have mentioned it a few times and now you have acted as if it were a new thing entirely. The Group of the Progressive Alliance of Socialists and Democrats will support Mr Czarnecki’s report. We share his criticism and that of the other groups. We will not grant discharge to the Council, either today or next month. I am therefore surprised by the request by Mrs Andreasen, since I obviously believe that the Member States are responsible for 80% of the funds. That does not exempt the Council from its responsibilities, since the Council is not a fourth or fifth institution in the EU, but works together with the Member States. However, our criticism, I agree, has no real consequences. As Mr Audy has pointed out, we must develop our tools. Every year, we show the Council the yellow card of discharge refusal and nothing happens. We must therefore develop our tools: not only tangible criticism, but also consequences – what happens if the Council does not work with us. That will possibly also mean constitutional change.

 Mr President, Commissioners, ladies and gentlemen, this joint debate this morning and the high quality of all three reports indicates the high priority given to internal market and consumer policy in Europe. I would like to thank all three rapporteurs and the many shadow rapporteurs and fellow Members who have produced this joint work. I would like to focus on two crucial points. The first is that we, that is, the Commission and those of us in this House, are assuming that everything runs relatively harmoniously in the internal market and that we have enlightened consumers and fair suppliers. That is often the case, but not always. There are irresponsible suppliers who only see their short-term profits and therefore, we need stronger market surveillance and supervision. However, there are also uninformed consumers. We need better information. It is not enough for the package leaflet to be readable. We need continuous information. Someone has just said that we need confidence. However, confidence comes from knowledge. I have heard that in Germany, only one in two 14 to 15 year olds understands the meaning of inflation. I do not even want to ask what the results of the questionnaire were when it came to the word ‘deflation’. We need schools to be better networked along with information on the conflict between the interests of suppliers and consumers. That is mentioned in the reports by my fellow Members ...

 Mr President, Commissioner, Mr Caldeira, ladies and gentlemen, I would like to start by thanking Mr Caldeira and his team. His report will be very useful to us in our deliberations which lead up to the granting of a discharge. I have a sense of déjà vu, because as far as I can tell, the Council is once again conspicuous by its absence, just as it was last year. I am being so critical because the Council, as one of our major community institutions, cannot and should not stand outside this debate. We rightly expect all the Member States to provide control and transparency, but we also expect this from our own institutions and the Council is jointly responsible for what happens or does not happen in the Member States. Of course, the irregularities in the budgets do not affect the Council’s budget as severely as they do the agricultural sector, but nevertheless, we will also have questions about public procurement, late payments or overdue payments and repeated overestimating. We will be discussing this with the Council in the next few weeks. It is true that errors are not the same as fraud and that the recovery of payments is a useful tool. Another good tool is the process of naming and shaming in the area of agricultural policy which has proved its worth in Bavaria and in the rest of Germany. I believe that we should continue to use this method because it has become clear that the Member States and the companies involved react to it. We expect the Swedish Presidency to be ready to discuss this over the next few days and also… (The President cut off the speaker) Bernd Lange,

Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, what are we dealing with here? We are dealing with an issue which concerns fair trade. This is not about protectionism for European products. There is one issue, and one issue alone, at stake, namely ensuring that our trade relations are based on fairness. I therefore believe that the threat scenario that China is now creating is completely inappropriate. Let me make it very clear: we want transparency in the investigations, and we do not welcome attempts by China to obstruct these investigations by creating threat scenarios, in which European companies are put under pressure with the threat of countermeasures that are supposedly in the pipeline. No, that is not part of the discussion! We intend to investigate the matter. In reality, however, it is about the following issue. Under what kind of working conditions are the solar panels produced in China? Which direct and indirect subsidies go towards supporting their production? What about the value chain as a whole? There are many different aspects which need to be investigated very carefully.  There is undoubtedly overcapacity. We cannot have a situation in which dumping is used to reduce overcapacity, at the expense of European jobs and industry. That is why we need to achieve transparency here. Hence my question, and this is also addressed to the Commission: does this transparency exist on the Chinese side as well? Does the Commission have the opportunity to look at all of the relevant facts? That should have been China’s immediate reaction: instead of making threatening gestures, it should have created transparency. Secondly, are you willing to pursue this process to the end, even if China were to yield at the last moment? We do not want a situation like the ethanol case with the United States, when the procedure was shelved at the last minute! I urge you to pursue it right to the end. Bernd Lange,  
rapporteur for the opinion of the Committee on International Trade.

(DE) 
Mr President, Madam President-in-Office of the Council, I would like to begin by sincerely thanking the rapporteur for what is, in my view, an excellent report which covers the many different facets of our relations with Kazakhstan in a truly outstanding manner. Thank you very much indeed.  Speaking on behalf of the Committee on International Trade, I would like to talk about four aspects which are particularly important to us. First of all, as the President-in-Office of the Council has already mentioned, Kazakhstan is seeking accession to the WTO, and that means, of course, that it must comply with and implement WTO rules. It will also be subject to the WTO’s dispute settlement regime. This is an important step towards transparency and fairness.  Secondly, when we talk about transparency and fairness, raw materials are, of course, an issue of great relevance in this context. Kazakhstan’s economy is geared mainly towards the raw materials sector, so the main priority here is to create workable tax and financial frameworks, but without losing sight of the environmental dimension. The aim must be to ensure that raw materials extraction serves the interests of the people of Kazakhstan but also safeguards the interests of the environment. Thirdly, this includes the issue of phosphorus, for example. We cannot have a situation in which the export of phosphorus involves the use of dumping practices, ultimately putting a question mark over well-established structures in the European Union. We support trade, but it must take place under conditions which are fair and reasonable. Fourthly, as in all the trade agreements concluded by the EU, trade also means fair conditions of competition in the fields of workers’ rights and environmental standards. For that reason, we also need to include a sound and viable chapter on sustainable development in the agreement. We want this demand to be reflected in the resolution; that is our firm position. Bernd Lange  (S&amp;D
). 
 – (DE) 
Mr President, Commissioner, I think you are being too defensive if you only examine how the consequences of plant closures and overcapacity can be remedied. No, I believe we need to examine how corporate policy can be shaped in a sensible way. The lesson is firstly that we need different forms of corporate governance. We need employees to be more involved in their companies so that sensible solutions can be found for the future of firms. This is one of the central lessons learned from the crisis: greater worker participation in companies to enable sensible solutions to be found. Secondly, Commissioner, we in fact have 15 factories in the European Union that are running at around 50 % capacity. When I look at the global market, however, Commissioner, car production is growing from roughly 79 million to 84 million. Something is wrong here! It is unacceptable that we are de-industrialising here, while, on the other hand, the global automotive market is growing by 3 % a year. No, we do not need to just close down car factories, we need investments in future technologies to ensure that the automotive industry remains in Europe and is competitive on the global market. This also means that global corporations must be urged to exercise restraint, as they also make global investment decisions and do not necessarily place a particular emphasis on European interests. A more active role is therefore required from the European Commission! Bernd Lange,  
on behalf of the S&amp;D Group
. – (DE) 
Mr President, Commissioner, yes, we support you in your efforts to bolster the European steel industry. I also think it is right that trends that are also in evidence in the steel industry, namely simply reducing capacities, are not followed. Just recently I read an article in the press by the President of the European steel industry body that said that 100 000 of the close to 400 000 jobs in the industry would have to be cut, that we had to shed 25 % of capacity – a hard, deep cut. No, we cannot deal with the problem like this. We must make sure that we stabilise this core industry in the European Union and create prospects for development. This of course was a foundation stone on which the European Union was built. I would like to bring to mind the European Coal and Steel Community, which very successfully developed a research and structural policy for the steel sector. I believe that there should continue to be such a model; work on the further development of the European steel industry should involve three equally represented groups – the Commission, employers and employees.  What we really need are innovations to ensure we have highly flexible steel at our disposal, particularly for the energy transition, an area in which there is undoubtedly demand. We must also ensure that the steel industry can exist in a competitive environment and is not unduly burdened with costs. You therefore have our support to stabilise the European steel industry.

Madam President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, this agreement must indeed be scrutinised very carefully for it has major political implications. In Israel, there is a debate under way as to whether, with this agreement, we mean to support Israel or show it the red card. In my view, this is an unproductive debate. It is not for us to adopt a position on the State of Israel and its people. Our task is simply to adopt a position towards the present Israeli Government.  When we conclude agreements with other countries, it is only right and proper that we apply the standards and values that we uphold in the European Union to our partner countries as well. With that in mind, it must be said that the present Israeli Government, in its conduct towards the Occupied Territories and the people who live there, is not acting in accordance with the values to which the European Union is committed. That is why we cannot enter into an agreement with that government without giving the matter careful thought. Secondly, there is still a lack of clarity on a number of points. The previous speaker said that there was a consensus here. No, there is no consensus. The vote in committee was 13 to 15. In my view, the origin of generic drugs is an issue that must be clarified in future in order to ensure that they do not come from the Occupied Territories or from illegal settlements. We must also clarify how the Commission will in future exercise the right to extend this agreement to other products as well. That is why we need more time for a thorough-going discussion and why I fully support Véronique De Keyser’s demand for this matter to referred back to committee for intensive deliberation.

 Our values apply on an universal basis, of course. We make no distinction at all. Why you adopted the position you did two years ago is not something that I can explain. From our perspective, the situation is quite clear: we are not pulling arguments out of thin air. We want to ensure that the agreement, which will, after all, serve as a model for future agreements as well, is sound. That is the reason why we are asking for more time to discuss it, Mr Caspary.

 Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I move to defer the vote on the legislative declaration and to refer it back to committee, so that we can enter into trialogue. Bernd Lange,  
on behalf of the S&amp;D Group
. – (DE) 
Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, when negotiating the Economic Partnership Agreements (EPAs), we must always remember that we are entering the negotiations with different requirements. We have the European Union on one side with a strong Commissioner and a large team of officials, sitting across the negotiating table from young countries with little capacity. To this extent it is more than right and proper to allow these countries more time and opportunity for negotiations. We should not give the impression that we are putting pressure on these countries by abruptly ending market access opportunities. I also believe that we should not force anyone to sign something but rather that, in a spirit of partnership, we should negotiate solutions with these countries that are acceptable to both sides. Sometimes this requires a bit more time. That is why the Group of the Progressive Alliance of Socialists and Democrats in the European Parliament clearly supports the proposal from Mr Martin to give this two years, but no more than two years, in order to identify ways in which we can reach agreement. Mr Fjellner, I would ask you to support this compromise, because we have succeeded in obtaining a sizeable majority in committee in favour of sending clear signals that this should be brought to a close, while at the same time offering opportunities for negotiations.

Mr President, Commissioner, Mr Kariņš, I should like to start by extending the warmest of thanks to the rapporteur, Mr Kariņš, for his hard work and, above all, for his patience during negotiations. I would also like to thank you, Mr Oettinger, for your proposal. In general, you are doing your work really well in the area of energy policy. The object of my criticism, in other words the Council, is not here at present. Ladies and gentlemen, I have participated in around 50 conciliation procedures and trialogues, involving negotiations with the Council. However, in all this time, I have never witnessed anything like this before, namely that the Council has taken a heavy-handed position, seeking to blackmail Parliament by saying: take it or leave it. I have never known the Council’s chief negotiator to get up and leave a trialogue before. So, we have a contradiction to what we are constantly being told in the sermons from on high: we need more involvement from Europe. This morning we have once again discussed the fact that what we need in this crisis situation is more involvement from Europe and an agreement in relation to our core policies. Mr Oettinger, you have hit the nail on the head. Energy policy is central to the European Union, to economic growth and to a forward-looking energy policy. It is only logical, ladies and gentlemen, that we can only have a sound energy policy if we can also agree on a common external energy policy, in other words agreements with third countries. Accordingly, while I understand and sympathise with the idea that achieving the lowest standard is better than nothing, we must press for greater commitment in this legislative proposal. We want to make it mandatory for the Commission to be informed and we want the Commission to participate in negotiations. That is the least we need in order to ensure that a European external energy policy really is put into practice and that the Member States do not drag their feet as usual. We shall table these amendments tomorrow and hope that you will support them so that we can give the Council something more to work with. Commissioner, I am naturally hopeful that you are really serious about your last point, namely that there should be an examination of the Council’s behaviour in future, so that we can get a reasonable revision on track.

Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, thank you for attending this evening’s sitting, so that we can discuss this matter. This issue is clearly not of interest to everyone in plenary this evening. With these safeguard regulations we are still feeling our way somewhat in relation to the Treaty of Lisbon, because the roles of the various institutions and where certain things are regulated are still unclear. Thus we now have to incorporate a number of items in the legislation, by which I mean the ordinary legislation, that have already been included in the wording of the Treaty and in the Council’s decision, but which were in the wrong place. That is why it is good practice to take a closer look at the overall process of establishing this safety net for the agreement with Colombia and Peru. On the one hand, we are placing demands on Colombia and Peru in the agreement and now we must also see how we can define the requirements that we place on ourselves. It is also important that the safety net should remain practicable. It makes little sense to set down regulations that are never applied. This is how things were done in the past. For this reason, we should exercise the powers we have to dust down the safety net legislation so that we can apply it in a positive way. Commissioner, we are concerned about five points. The first is to see what the actual criteria are for casting a safety net. I am quite convinced that, in order to determine when something is having a detrimental effect on the market, we must also address the issue of social standards because, of course, the violation of social standards leads to dumping and can give rise to competitive advantages. Accordingly, this is one of the criteria for applying safety nets, particularly in the area of bananas. Now for my second point. If we are cautious in our approach to the Treaty of Lisbon, then we will naturally find ourselves being more and more cautious about the role of the European Parliament. It is fundamental for us that we, like all the other European institutions, should have the power to launch an investigation. My third point is that if we are serious about more transparency, then this also means that we must include civil society in our dialogue to a greater extent and that this should be institutionalised when we come to examine this agreement with Colombia and Peru. That is why I want to strengthen dialogue with civil society. We need more transparency. Commissioner, you always refer to the safeguard regulations with Korea as a template. The problem is that you have forgotten Article 11 of the agreement with Korea when it comes to the issue of the transparency of monitoring and reporting. I am referring to the requirement that a report must be presented that covers all the different angles, which is something we want to see guaranteed. The fifth issue relates to providing security for the banana producers in Europe’s regions. Bernd Lange,

Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, we have a huge amount of work ahead of us in the coming three to four months. In accordance with Parliament’s decision, we are going to launch a road map for strengthening workers’ rights, human rights and environmental conditions in Colombia and Peru, while also establishing a safety net for conditions here in the European Union. Neither of these is an easy task. Hence my urgent call on you, Commissioner, to support this work in whatever way you can, particularly with regard to the road map and the involvement of the government in Peru, in order to ensure that we establish a road map for Colombia and Peru within a reasonable timeframe. I get the feeling that the message has not been fully understood there and that people are unaware of just how serious Parliament is about its conditions. Secondly, Commissioner, I would ask you to please take an active mediator role in relation to the Council in the trialogue on the safeguards, so that we can also implement the safeguard regulations in a reasonable timeframe to ensure that we have both the road map and safeguard regulation in place in good time to enable us to vote on this in November and finally put this matter to bed, in the interests of the people of Europe and the people of Colombia and Peru.

 Madam President, Mr De Gucht, ladies and gentlemen, this is a political issue on which we have to decide. We in the Group of the Progressive Alliance of Socialists and Democrats in the European Parliament have analysed the Anti-Counterfeiting Trade Agreement (ACTA) very closely and carefully, and we would like to make it clear that ACTA is not a suitable instrument for guaranteeing copyright protection and preventing counterfeiting. ACTA is the wrong instrument for this and, therefore, we in the S&amp;D Group will be voting against it. Why is that? For three reasons. Firstly, the countries which are mainly responsible for counterfeiting and disregarding copyright are not the subject of the agreement. The good have been sorted out from the bad and, in international terms, it makes absolutely no sense. Secondly, ladies and gentlemen, rules from the analogue area of counterfeiting have been transferred into the digital world and, as a result, the wrong rules are being imposed on consumers who behave differently in a digital environment. This is why we are saying that we cannot put apples and pears into a saucepan and finish up with apple sauce. The wrong things are being combined here and that is the second reason why we are opposed to ACTA. However, ladies and gentlemen, the most important reason is the third one. ACTA is putting the digital world into a straitjacket and we do not even know whether we want it, because the question of enforcing intellectual property rights on the Internet, in the digital environment, has not even been resolved within the European Union. The Commission’s presentation of its legislative proposal is overdue. How can we conclude an international agreement in this area if we have not even discussed the legislative proposal within the European Union and drafted some sensible legislation? Therefore, let us put ACTA to one side and, first of all, draw up a sensible European law. I call on the Commission to submit a legislative proposal for the European Union.

Blue-card answer.

You are mixing up apples and pears again. Climate policy is obviously something quite different from the question of copyright protection. You know very well that 60% of all counterfeit products come from China and this is why it is genuinely necessary for the international community to enter into a dialogue with China in order to find a solution and not simply to sort out the good countries from the bad ones, Mr Fjellner. Bernd Lange,  
on behalf of the S&amp;D Group.

 Mr President, Commissioner, and of course – at least virtually – President-in-Office of the Council, our resolution is essentially directed towards the Council, as the reality is that we believe – and this touches on Mr Leichtfried’s question – that we, as Parliament, should proffer our position on the issuing of a mandate before one is issued. There is a good reason for this. You have already addressed the resolutions that we have adopted with numerous questions. These resolutions did show quite clearly the two sides of the coin when it comes to trade relations with Japan. We support increased trade relations with Japan – that much is clear – as the negotiations at WTO level have ground to a halt and Japan is one of our most important trading partners in the world. Over the last year, EU exports to Japan had a total value of around EUR 49 billion, while exports from Japan to the EU came in at around EUR 69 billion – in other words, we are talking about a very important part of our economic dynamics. That being the case, we need to also strengthen this so that the inter-exchange and the growth dynamic develop further. That is right and proper. On the other side of the coin, however, when it comes to market access on the Japanese side, we actually have non-tariff barriers to trade. That, after all, is why the Commission carried out this scoping exercise, and it was only recently that we obtained the results. Once again, analysing this situation precisely is the right thing to do. No sooner do we look, for example, at the key sector that is the motor industry, than three non-tariff barriers to trade hit us right in the face. Of course there is, for one thing, an agreement at UN level about technical standards for cars, as well as for vehicle parts. Clearly, recognition of this is crucial to market access. The European Union has signed up to nearly all of these guidelines, whereas Japan has only signed up to 43. In order to also be able to supply car parts to the Japanese market with unfettered access, it is actually a basic prerequisite that Japan, too, should sign up to these UN conventions. If I consider, now, the tax breaks enjoyed by environmentally friendly vehicles, I can see that, in Japan, these depend solely on test cycle JC08. Logic dictates, however, that this cycle is not adhered to by vehicles that we produce here, as we test according to a different cycle, the European driving cycle. It needs to be ensured that the same tax benefits for environmentally friendly vehicles – we define these as vehicles emitting below 90 grams of CO2
 per kilometre – are ensured for European vehicles in Japan, too, without jeopardising the standard by so doing. Of course, traders must also have the opportunity to offer their cars for sale in Japan, and to have them maintained in workshops there. Current property law does not provide for that. So, then, we need a tougher re-presentation of the scoping exercise and clear guidelines from Parliament. That is why we are calling on the Council to wait until September to issue a mandate, that is, until Parliament has drawn up clear guidelines for a mandate for trade relations with Japan.

 Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, I, too, would like to thank the rapporteur, Mr Fjellner, and also the shadow rapporteur, Mr Martin, and the other shadow rapporteurs. They really have succeeded in negotiating a good compromise. I also call for us to pass this compromise with the largest possible majority, as there has been real success here in granting these unilateral advantages in a more targeted way. The EU’s trade policy, after all, is oft-criticised. In this area, however, it is clear that we are granting unilateral advantages to the poorest and next-to-poorest countries in the world, so that they can bolster their development on the back of these advantages. We will now be making this more targeted, and that is exactly the right approach to take. With the GSP+ countries, we are inviting them – on the basis of common values in relation to human rights and sustainability – to intensify trade relations with us still further. This also helps to strengthen sustainable development on the global level. Here too, then, what we have is a reasonable approach. We have also ensured, however, that there are not sudden distortions in our industrial relations. In that connection, we have incorporated appropriate safety nets in those areas in which there is a competitive environment for our industrial products, so that we can very confidently say that we are granting unilateral advantages without jeopardising any jobs within the European Union. For those countries that will be leaving the GSP scheme, it goes without saying that the door is not closed. We invite all of them to conclude intensive trade relations with us – be it via bilateral trade negotiations, through the WTO, or through economic partnership agreements (EPAs) – with the aim of bringing about sustainable development.

 Mr President, Mr De Gucht, I believe it is clear that trade is not an end in itself but a means of improving people’s living conditions. A glance at the situation in Colombia and Peru shows that the process of improving living conditions there involves major challenges. Against this background, Parliament is, of course, investigating very carefully, on the basis of the rights granted to it under the Treaty of Lisbon, whether this trade agreement with Colombia and Peru meets these requirements. It is very unlikely that the trade agreement alone will be able to overcome these challenges. The issues include the extent to which civil society is included in the process of implementing the trade agreement, the independence of its involvement and the options for instigating complaint procedures. There is also the question of the restrictions placed on efforts to implement the sustainability chapter. Article 267 and Article 277 specify the possible restrictions relating to material resources. We believe it is necessary for us to enter into additional agreements with the Colombian and the Peruvian governments so that we can be certain that the trade agreement will bring about significant improvements in the living conditions of the people. One aspect of this involves improving the employment rights of people who are working in the informal sector. Around 58% of people in Colombia, for example, are employed in the informal sector and their working conditions are quite different from those of people with formal jobs. The question of how the interests of workers are represented must be reconsidered, in particular, in the light of International Labour Organisation (ILO) Conventions 129 and 135. Job security and social dialogue also need to be improved in line with ILO Convention 144. The United States and Switzerland have put in place action plans to accompany their free trade agreements and we should follow their example. Bernd Lange  (S&amp;D

 Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, you will have noticed from Mr Lambsdorff’s remarks that the issue here is not an objective debate, but rather the elections in Germany. All I can say here is that for a party on the political defensive, a debate like this, with so many wrong-headed arguments, may be one way to stay afloat. However this is to ignore the facts. The situation in Germany is that the government supported by Mr Lambsdorff’s party already levies a tax rate on diesel above the future minimum tax rate. At present, we have a minimum tax rate of EUR 0.33 in Germany, which would be increased to EUR 0.41; however, the German Government already takes EUR 0.47. In other words, there would be no immediate change. Thus, it is wrong to say that the price of diesel fuel will sky-rocket in the morning. The second point is proportionality. We Social Democrats have always said that proportionality is not unconditional. We have tabled Amendment 15 precisely with this in mind. We must not drive the diesel engine to extinction through taxation. We Social Democrats proposed this amendment, which the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs was happy to adopt. But what happens next? Obviously our Liberal and Conservative colleagues distrust their own governments because the definition of the absolute tax rate is still a matter for the Member States and their governments. The level of distrust is so great that they believe that if this resolution is adopted, the governments they support will increase diesel taxes. That is why I can understand it when people say that this distrust will result in the rejection of proportionality. If your distrust really is so great, then I believe it is right to reject proportionality in this case. I have one final word to add. If everyone is suddenly a supporter of diesel, then I find myself wondering why these governments are not moving to switch from taxing cars to taxing CO2
 emissions, benefiting the more economical diesel engine. You can do this immediately without consulting Europe. What is stopping you? Bernd Lange  (S&amp;D
),  
Blue-card question.
 – (DE) 
Mr Seeber, I have a supplementary question. Are you unaware that we Social Democrats tabled an amendment in the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs drawing attention to precisely this problem – namely, that this could lead to problems with industrial policy and the questioning of the CO2
 reduction strategy for cars – and that this amendment was adopted by the Economic Affairs Committee? Bernd Lange  (S&amp;D

 Mr President, Mr Mato Adrover, I see things in a fundamentally different way. This agreement cannot be compared with the fisheries agreement. In the case of the fisheries agreement, it was not clear where the money paid by the European Union would be going. In this case we have clear rules about who benefits from the money – and the beneficiaries really are Moroccan producers – as well as about European investments into Morocco. With that being the case, the situation is completely different. It is also completely clear that, with this agreement, we are not legitimising the situation in Western Sahara. On the contrary, we are saying clearly that a solution needs to be found in the interests of the people. We are also making that clear with our resolution. We cannot, however, send out a signal to the Arab Spring that we will always seal off our markets per se. We do need to offer solutions for fair trade so that there really can be change through trade. It also means that, if there really are distortions in the European Union in agriculture, we need to ensure, within the EU, that our farmers also have development perspectives. We cannot simply close our borders, however. That would be a signal that would heighten the sense of disappointment in the Arab Spring. For these reasons I will recommend to Members in my group that they vote in favour of this agreement. Bernd Lange,  
rapporteur for the opinion of the Committee on International Trade

 Mr President, Mr Bütikofer, I too wish to start by expressing my thanks for this ambitious report and the huge amount of work it has entailed. Mr Tajani, raw materials policy is essential to the development of European industry. The trade dimension is decisive, which is why I believe it is right for raw materials policy to be anchored in an international context from the perspective of industrial policy in Europe. A number of points are key here: If we intend to secure our supply of raw materials in the world by means of partnership agreements, we can only do this by ensuring that the businesses that extract these raw materials also conduct themselves in a reasonable way. It is unacceptable for European businesses to evade tax or for workers to be required to work under inhuman conditions. That is why it is clear that if we intend to mine raw materials, then businesses need to comply with clear social and environmental standards. Secondly, we must also ensure that the raw materials that we use do not come from crisis regions and are not used to finance groups who use the money earned from raw materials to fund civil war. We need an international certification system for the extraction of raw materials and for tracing trade, so that we can tell where raw materials come from. By the way, excellent footprints can be found for raw materials everywhere. Thirdly, we must ensure that we do not export raw materials illegally. In our own interests, we need to close any loopholes in our legislation – this last remark is addressed to Mr Florenz. However, we also need to improve controls. The system will never work if a single individual is to be required to ensure controls in a large European port. Exports need closer monitoring and it is necessary to ensure that monopolistic and oligopolistic structures in raw materials trade are eliminated. The good news, Commissioner, is that the Commission is moving in the right direction. Bernd Lange  (S&amp;D
).

 Mr President, Commissioner, we all firmly believe that we must help the people in Pakistan, but the instrument that you are proposing, Commissioner, is the wrong one, for three reasons. The first is that there is absolutely no proof that trade facilitation will benefit the people affected by the floods. On the contrary, we can even see that the textile industry in Pakistan is based in other regions and, in recent years, has even experienced growth. Thus, this sector is not really affected at all. How we intend to help the people affected by the floods by means of trade facilitation is beyond me. Secondly, I cannot understand how we can now grant these facilitations to a country that plainly does not meet the GSP+ conditions in terms of social and environmental standards and send a signal to other countries, like Bangladesh, which do meet these conditions, that essentially tells them that their efforts are not wanted and it is also possible to achieve this status by other means. My third argument, Commissioner, is that this is not an approach based on solidarity, because the burden in Europe is borne in a one-sided manner by certain sectors and certain countries only. If we want to do something, then we should do so in a spirit of solidarity with all countries and with the involvement of everyone, and that means we need direct aid for the flood victims. That would be the right approach to take. Bernd Lange  (S&amp;D
).

 Madam President, Commissioner, I really do think it is important that, following the entry into force of the Treaty of Lisbon, we decide on the structure of the negotiations together, because this Treaty gives Parliament a new role in trade relations. If we once again consider the fact that India is clearly a market of the future, we must also feed this back into a clear position adopted by Parliament: In our view, industrial development in the European Union – linked to jobs – is of key importance. We therefore need to make it clear that the interests of jobs in industry in Europe must take priority in the trade agreements. For that reason, although an agreement has to be asymmetrical, at the end of the day, the tariffs must be zero. It is not acceptable for us to have tariffs of 100% in mechanical engineering and the automotive sector and, in the end, perhaps negotiate 50%. As long as we do not have any zero tariffs, it will encourage investments outside Europe. Therefore, Commissioner, we need to clearly define our priority areas and they lie in industry. We also need a level playing field to be established with regard to social standards, and it is also necessary for clear obligations to be imposed on India in relation to workers’ rights. Bernd Lange  (S&amp;D

Madam President, I am somewhat disappointed that Parliament was unable to approve this by a majority today in order to learn sensible lessons from the reactor disaster in Japan. I consider it beyond question that this must mean organising a clear shift in energy policy away from nuclear energy – in order words, the beginning of a phase-out – at European level. Secondly, it should also be obvious that if we carry out stress tests, then any nuclear power plant that fails these tests is required to be removed from the grid. Neither of these proposals received a majority in the vote. I was therefore unable to support the resolution. I hope that we will soon succeed in organising a uniform energy policy that provides us with safe and sensible energy in the future, which means movement towards energy efficiency and renewable energies.

 Madam President, Mr Tajani, ladies and gentlemen, this report presents the position of the European Parliament very clearly. I would like thank the shadow rapporteurs who have contributed to the report and the rapporteurs for the opinion of the relevant committees. Together, we have succeeded in conveying a clear message, Mr Tajani, which is that we want to move industrial policy closer to the centre of the political arena, for good reason. Industrial policy will help us, firstly, to create good quality, future-proof jobs in Europe and, secondly, to secure investment in Europe. Our competitors all over the world are making good use of industrial policy, for example, in the United States, China, Brazil and India. Thirdly, we are faced with challenges relating to sustainability, both in terms of the climate and the economic and social foundations of our society. Against this background, it is important for us to put industrial policy at the centre of the political arena. On the one hand, this means that we expect industrial policy to be integrated in such a way, Mr Tajani, that it becomes the focal point of legislative initiatives within the European Union. We do not want to see environmental, trade and competition policies being drawn up first and only subsequently being coordinated with the interests of European industry. On the contrary, we must define the other areas of policy on the basis of the strategic interests of a sustainable industrial policy. Secondly, Mr Tajani, we need better coordination between the industrial policies in the different Member States. Therefore, I would like to ask you, and we have included this in the report, to make use of Article 173(2) of the Treaty of Lisbon, in order to coordinate industrial policy in the Member States more effectively, so that we really are all moving in the same direction. We must, of course, focus on a number of specific areas. On the horizontal level, we need to look, in particular, at innovation policy throughout the entire value-added chain. We must succeed in supporting the entire economic chain, from fundamental research through to the market launch of products, and in bringing the best solutions for our society onto the market. We also need to pay more attention to resources. Simply saying that this is important is not enough. We need to introduce practical legislation which will significantly increase resource productivity. In industry, labour is responsible for 20% of costs and resources for 40%. That is a starting point for action on raw materials. The mobile phones that we all use contain rare earths and metals, which are seldom recycled. The recycling rate for mobile phones is only 1.5%. That is a starting point for creating jobs and increasing the competitiveness of European industry. I would like to make one last point in this context. Innovation and resource productivity will not happen by themselves. They depend on the employees who are involved. For this reason, a sensible industrial policy must also take into consideration the skills and the involvement of employees. If we can bring this about, then I am confident that we will have future-proof jobs in European industry. Bernd Lange,  
rapporteur.
 – (DE)
 Madam President, Mr Tajani, ladies and gentlemen, thank you very much for your many inspiring contributions. Mr Tajani, the four key messages which bring us together are clear. Firstly, we want to ensure that industrial policy lies at the heart of EU policy. Secondly, we want to link together sustainability and competitiveness and develop them further. Thirdly, we must not take a dogmatic approach, because this area cannot be regulated by the market alone or by the state alone. We need practical, sensible measures. Fourthly, this is just the beginning and not the end of the discussion on modernising industrial policy in the European Union. We are extending a hand to you, Mr Tajani, but we are also aware that we must take you at your word. We are expecting concrete legislative proposals and also concrete measures to provide financial support, particularly in the field of research. Mr Tajani, if we are successful, and if the hand that we are extending to you and the statement that you have made are compatible, perhaps we will find ourselves in a situation similar to that at the end of the wonderful film ‘Casablanca’, when Humphrey Bogart says to the police captain: ‘I think this is the beginning of a beautiful friendship!’ Bernd Lange,

 Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, the Treaty of Lisbon has in fact put trade policy on a new footing. The EU is solely responsible for trade policy and Parliament gives or withholds its consent. In that respect, we have gained a new responsibility. We can only enable this new responsibility to take shape if we act together. We have proven that very clearly in this matter. In this regard, I would also like to thank the rapporteurs and shadow rapporteurs. Trade policy is not an end in itself. Its purpose is, firstly, to strengthen jobs and industrial development in the European Union and, secondly, to improve conditions for people in other countries of the world. The aim of trade policy must be to achieve both of these goals. We therefore need to assess this agreement from this viewpoint. Overall, this is a step in the right direction towards fulfilling these two requirements. However, we certainly do have a few points of criticism, for example the question of duty drawback in South Korea, which will bring one-sided competitive advantages for certain sectors of industry in South Korea, particularly in sensitive areas such as the automotive industry. It was therefore right for us to have very intensive talks about a safeguard clause and also to have jointly implemented such a clause, which provides for the close monitoring of precisely these points, so that we can be certain that the possibilities provided by duty drawback in South Korea do not lead to a distortion of competition in Europe. Parliament has rightly established safeguards here. Secondly, this agreement also has the purpose of improving the situation in South Korea for our colleagues there. South Korea still has improvements to make with regard to Chapter 13, in particular the question of the core labour standards laid down by the ILO. Two absolutely crucial core labour standards – No 87 and No 98, relating to collective bargaining – have not be implemented or ratified. Section 314 of the penal code relates to the obstruction of business. Neither of these things is in line with the nature and the provisions of this agreement. Thus, Commissioner, I am relying on you, and on the statement that you have given in support of the safeguard clause, to change this situation in South Korea so that this agreement will represent a blueprint for the future to enable globalisation to proceed in a fair manner. Bernd Lange,  
on behalf of the S&amp;D Group.

 Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, I would first like to add my thanks to the rapporteur for the good cooperation that has helped Parliament unanimously adopt an extremely fundamental position in Committee – which is very much to be welcomed – and which has once again made clear the significance of this safeguard regulation. Together with the agreement with South Korea, this is the first agreement that we have negotiated following the entry into force of the Treaty of Lisbon, which gave Parliament a new role that it must play. Secondly, this Free Trade Agreement with South Korea and the safeguard regulation are also something of a blueprint for future agreements, and to this extent, we must tread particularly carefully here. These are two important reasons why we should not nonchalantly adopt diluted positions, but should really fight for prudent regulations to be adopted. As you are aware, Commissioner, there are six points that we are particularly concerned about here. I would like to give a brief recap of what these are. Firstly, the duty drawback mechanism. If Korean manufacturers use parts from third countries when manufacturing their goods, they do not have to pay duty on these and can export them to Europe, while European manufacturers – even if they use the same parts – do not enjoy this exemption from duty. This therefore provides Korean manufacturers with a competitive advantage. This must be closely monitored to see whether it gives rise to distortion of the market. That cannot be achieved by means of a simple declaration; rather, it must be made legally binding by including it in the safeguard regulation as a basis for initiating investigations. Secondly, there will also be regional variation. The sensitive sectors are not all represented equally strongly in all the Member States. Consequently, we must pay particular attention to how sensitive sectors in individual regions can be protected from targeted assaults. That is no simple task, because we are in an internal market – but a political solution must be found. Thirdly, as this is the first agreement since the Treaty of Lisbon, Commissioner, it also involves a new balance between the Council and Parliament; and since we have also reached agreement with the Commission, it is only right that an equal role for Parliament and the Council is anchored in the agreement. Fourthly, the implementation processes are, of course, your business – we have no desire to interfere with the operational implementation – but as Parliament we must ensure that Parliament’s rights are not brought into question in the comitology procedure. In particular, we need a right of withdrawal – this, too, must be ensured. My fifth point is that many decades of experience with South Korea has shown us that in addition to tariff trade policy, non-tariff barriers to trade are constantly being constructed. We must therefore also have a clear mechanism for monitoring, reporting and initiating consultations should problems arise in the area of non-tariff barriers to trade. My sixth point is that if we are serious about this new kind of trade agreement, then we must also involve and strengthen civil society. This means that fundamental ILO standards – such as standard 87, which grants workers the right to strike – need to be firmly rooted and implemented. In contrast, Article 314 of South Korea’s penal code states that ‘Interfering with the smooth running of the business’ is a criminal offence. We need to do something about this – civil society must be strengthened, fundamental ILO standards and fundamental environmental standards must be ensured, and civil society must also be involved in the monitoring of the agreement in the form of the Domestic Advisory Groups. My final point, Commissioner, is that you said that provisional application will most likely occur once agreement has been reached. I would like to delete this ‘most likely’. Provisional application cannot take place until Parliament has reached a decision on this matter! (Applause) Bernd Lange  (S&amp;D

Mr President, President-in-Office of the Council, Commissioner, I, too, would like to thank the Spanish Presidency and also the Commission for bringing the subject of electromobility to the fore. I also believe that we can use electromobility to revitalise the mobility economy in Europe, and we need to do that in order to create value and to safeguard jobs. However – to use another metaphor – we need to step on the accelerator, because the issue of electromobility affects many policy areas. There is, of course, the issue of standardisation, technology, but also the question of the integration of electromobility into the whole transport system, because we may need new forms of mobility, particularly in urban areas. Energy must be renewable and we need raw materials, so trade is also affected. Therefore, I would ask you, Commissioner, to perhaps integrate electromobility further in the follow-on from Cars 21. Bernd Lange  (S&amp;D

 Mr President, in the opinion of the Committee on Industry, Research and Energy, it is, of course, also important to protect small and medium-sized enterprises. Commissioner, competition is not an end in itself. If we look at the situation of small dealerships and small workshops, we need to increase their economic ability to act, otherwise one day we will only have large dealerships and large workshop chains. This includes, firstly, genuine authorisation for multi-branding. It includes allowing workshops and dealerships to have unrestricted access to information on vehicles and repair options. Thirdly, it includes providing the necessary opportunities for gaining qualifications. We talked earlier about electromobility. They also need to be in a position to maintain electric cars. Fourthly, they need investment security, in other words contractual protection and no more revisions. They need to be able to make safe investments over a long period. Bernd Lange,

 Mr President, Commissioner, I have three questions on my mind. The first is, why are we still lacking transparency when the Treaty of Lisbon has been in force since 1 December and we have had an interinstitutional agreement with the Commission since 10 February? I cannot understand why it is still the case that the Council is sitting at the table as an observer in the negotiations, Parliament is not involved and the documents are not publicly accessible. So why is this, Commissioner? The second question that is of concern to me is this: who is actually negotiating the ACTA Agreement? This is not being negotiated as some sort of follow-up agreement to TRIPS within the framework of the World Trade Organisation. It is only being negotiated by individual States and – as we hear from the United States – also by powerful economic interests. I ask myself whether, in fact, standards are not being set which will ultimately apply to everyone even though not everyone is sitting round the negotiating table. The third question that is troubling me, Commissioner, is this: what actually is the substance of the negotiations? In your hearing, you answered my question and assured me that the acquis communautaire
 was secure. However, when I look at individual papers that have leaked out I unfortunately have my doubts about this. I understand that negotiations are being held, that blocks on the Internet are possible, that providers are to be used, so to speak, to help police the Internet for economic interests, that restrictions on research and science may sometimes be imposed and that some people are even trying to introduce general surveillance systems. I therefore ask myself, where in all this is the acquis communautaire
? There is also the question of compensation. The fact that the inclusion of lost profit in the compensation is being negotiated is not appropriate for our policy. Of course, my third question, Commissioner, is what is the actual relationship between online and offline? When I read that online and offline are both supposed to represent the digital world, does that essentially mean that there are also to be restrictions and searches of laptops, iPods and MP3 players at borders? Would you please provide answers to these three questions. Bernd Lange  (S&amp;D

 Mr President, Commissioner, we all know that GSP is a good system and that GSP+ is a very good system. We also need to ensure their extension and so we need your proposal so that we can have a proper debate in Parliament. So, Commissioner, please speed things up. Even for GSP+, we may be able to introduce a few improvements. In this regard, there are five points that I would like to make concerning areas where we may be able to make further improvements. Firstly, who determines how the 27 standards are actually implemented, not only recognised in practice, but formally implemented? Is that the task of the ILO alone, or do we not need an assessment committee to provide specific support during implementation? Secondly, how are we involving civil society? I would like to see the coordination of civil society in the country in question in the assessment of the implementation of GSP+, just as we have now agreed in the agreement with South Korea. Thirdly, who actually initiates an investigation if any problems are detected? Parliament needs to be involved here, because I have the feeling that, in the Council, interests other than actually having an investigation carried out come into play. Parliament should also initiate an investigation in this connection. We surely also need clear structures for the next steps that we are to take as well as clearer structures for withdrawal, but perhaps we can talk about this in detail another time. Bernd Lange  (S&amp;D

 Mr President, Mr De Gucht, I have three questions for you. My first question concerns the need for fair competition conditions. The fact that employees’ rights in South Korea are restricted means that there are unfair competitive conditions, which include the question of collective action. Paragraph 314 of the South Korean Criminal Code refers to the crime of ‘disrupting operations’. This is used to prevent strikes and to limit the rights of trade unions, for example, in the case of Ssangyong. I would also like to know why we are concluding free trade agreements with countries such as South Korea and Colombia which have the most problems with the standards of the International Labour Organisation. Therefore, my first question is this: How do you propose to use the free trade agreement to ensure that there are no unfair competition conditions in South Korea caused by restrictions on employees’ rights? My second question relates to the problems in the car industry, which several other speakers have also referred to. It is very important in this case that there are sensible safeguard clauses. General safeguard clauses are currently in place for major market disruptions and for the duty drawback system. I am not able to understand this fully. Mr De Gucht, perhaps you could explain the safeguard clauses to me in simple terms. I would particularly like to know who can trigger them and when. My third question concerns the new contractual basis for our cooperation introduced by the Treaty of Lisbon. This includes approving safeguard clauses and implementation as part of the codecision process. Can you guarantee that the free trade agreement will not be put into force until Parliament has approved this procedure and only after Parliament has exercised its rights and adopted the safeguard clauses? Bernhard Rapkay,  
rapporteur.

 Mr President, I would like to just briefly explain the motion to postpone the debate. As you know, we held a number of rounds of negotiations with the Council about the unitary patent quite some time ago, and we reached a joint result at the end of November last year. The package consists of three parts: the patent regulation itself via the codecision procedure, the implementing regulation via the consultation procedure and a third area, consisting of an intergovernmental agreement. We reached an agreed result and, on 2 December last year, the chair of the Committee on Legal Affairs, Mr Lehne, received a letter from the Presidency of the Council containing the agreed text and a covering letter in which the Council committed to adopt exactly the enclosed text if Parliament adopted exactly what we had negotiated and agreed as well. For seven months, nothing has happened, as the Council has failed to get its act together on another matter, namely, the issue of where the seat of the central division of the patent court should be. This issue is not within our competence, however, and accordingly we have not got involved. There were three interested parties in this dispute, and in the last week the Council has decided, in its wisdom – something about which we are all aware – that all three interested parties will be getting the nod. That is not the crucial point, however, for which reason there is clearly cause to wonder whether what we have here is something of an oriental bazaar, but that would be an unfair insult to the serious traders of oriental bazaars. The problem is that it was also agreed to interfere in Parliament’s competences and to delete something from the regulation itself, specifically, three key articles. Coreper will be meeting tomorrow morning at 09.00 and formalising what the Heads of State or Government have agreed. It plans to then present us with that new text at 10.30 so that we can hold a debate on the basis of the new text in the afternoon, followed by a vote on Wednesday. This is a blatant violation of our agreement, and I believe that this is the first time this has happened in the history of our negotiations, informal trialogues, with the Council. This is not acceptable, Mr President, and that is why we are requesting that the item be taken off the agenda. (Applause)
 We are moving to have the item taken off the agenda as we cannot allow what I have just outlined to happen. Should Coreper decide tomorrow to adopt what is before me now, we will still have to discuss how we can move forward with this dossier all in all. Mr President, in order to avoid any interested parties getting the wrong impression, however, I want to make it clear that this is not just about this procedural issue, it is about a fundamental content-related issue. In many people’s view – including that of the Council in the negotiations themselves in the course of the last year – the removal of the three articles that has now been decided on is a blatant violation of European law. It is important to be aware of this. They want a regulation and a regulation should regulate something. They want to take out the regulatory content, in other words, exactly the things that are supposed to be regulated. That is remarkable in itself and it is why we have to take this item off the agenda at all events. Bernhard Rapkay,  
rapporteur

 Mr President, I would just like to say one thing regarding the debate previously mentioned on the immunity of Mr de Magistris, as I am also rapporteur in that case. I would like to point out that no debate on this has been included in the agenda, only a vote. I would also like to point that there are proceedings being brought against Mr de Magistris on a total of five accounts. This is only about one of these that is relatively uncontroversial. As regards the other accounts, we will first hear what Mr de Magistris has to say. Bernhard Rapkay,  
rapporteur
. – (DE)
 Mr President, I just wanted to clarify that, because some Members asked about it earlier. With regard to the defence of the parliamentary immunity of Viktor Uspaskich I have to say that this is not in fact what it is about. Mr Uspaskich does not have parliamentary immunity. Parliament waived Mr Uspaskich’s parliamentary immunity on 7 September 2010 – in other words, more than a year ago – and that situation has not changed. On the contrary, Mr Uspaskich has asked for his immunity to be reinstated on the basis of new information that he claims to have. What is the issue here? Mr Uspaskich is accused by the Lithuanian law enforcement authorities of having contravened party law and tax law in Lithuania during the period from 2004 to 2006 when he was chair of his party. He was not a Member of this House between 2004 and 2006. He was, however, a member of the Seimas (the Lithuanian Parliament). In 2008, the Seimas waived his immunity. He was then elected to the European Parliament in 2009, where he obviously received immunity once again. Then we had to deal with the matter. He was heard in Parliament twice. I want to make this point, because he always claims that he had no opportunity to present his case. He had two hearings in committee. I do not know whether Mr Uspaskich is guilty or whether he is innocent. He always maintains that he is innocent. I do not know. However, it is not my job, nor is it your job, to decide. It is the job of the judicial authorities in the Member State of Lithuania to decide. We simply have to determine whether two particular aspects to this case are such that his immunity, which he naturally has as a Member of the European Parliament, should be retained and that he should be subject to a different procedure to that of any normal citizen of his country. We have come to the conclusion that this is not the case. One aspect relates to the question of whether, through such proceedings, he is prevented from expressing his free political opinion as an MEP – but contravention of tax legislation actually has nothing to do with freedom of expression. The second aspect relates to the fact that, as a result of these proceedings, he is persecuted to a certain extent in his political activities. That is something that gives cause for consideration. However, after careful deliberation – following two hearings and after questioning the Lithuanian authorities once again – we reached the conclusion that this was not the case either. Thus, there was nothing else that we could do except waive his immunity. Mr Uspaskich then went to the Court of Justice of the European Union – as he is entitled to do – to the General Court, and brought an action for the annulment of our decision and for the suspension of the decision until the hearing for the main case. Of course, the Court of Justice of the European Union accepted this, but it rejected the application for a temporary order. Mr Uspaskich then declared that he had new information. Apparently, in WikiLeaks facts were published that confirm his position, and he is therefore asking for the case to be considered once again. He also said that he would withdraw his application to the court. I advised him most strongly against doing that. This is the only route that will enable him to obtain his right in court. I strongly advised him not to do it, but he nevertheless withdrew his appeal to the court. We then discussed the new facts in another hearing and came to the conclusion that these new facts may perhaps be relevant to the proceedings themselves in Lithuania, but not to the decision concerning the waiving of his immunity. We discussed the matter in detail, debating it for and against in several sittings, and we came to the firm conclusion that there is no other option: as we are not deciding on guilt or innocence here, but only on whether he has privileged access, we have to conclude that neither the first point, regarding ‘the free expression of his political opinion’, nor the second point, namely ‘political persecution’ are relevant here. There therefore remains nothing else for us to do but to maintain his immunity waiver. We are not making a decision to withdraw his immunity because it has already been withdrawn. Thus, in the report we conclude that his immunity should remain withdrawn. Bernhard Rapkay,

 Mr President, I am, of course, also speaking as rapporteur, because I have been involved with this matter for a long time. I have not done this for the pleasure of it, nor was I particularly keen on doing it. However, what we have just heard is not proof that the majority in committee were wrong the first time and again the second time. Nothing – absolutely nothing – has been put forward that indicates that. I am not making a judgment with regard to the role that Mr Uspaskich plays in politics in Lithuania. That is not my job. It is not your job, either. This issue here is: is he getting a fair trial or not? You will have to prove to me that he is not getting a fair trial. This proof has not been provided. Mr Tomaševski, please refrain from making comments about Bolshevists and similar things. That has more of an effect of disqualifying you rather than helping to establish the truth. Just to make it clear once again: the issue here is not for us to say whether he is guilty or not guilty. It is a matter of whether his right to free expression is being restricted or whether he is being politically persecuted. We came to the conclusion that neither of these are the case. That is the reason for our decision in committee and why this report states what it does. I can only recommend that plenary also votes in favour of our report as a whole. Bernhard Rapkay,  
on behalf of the S&amp;D Group. 
– (DE)
 Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, the explanatory statement from the rapporteur is quite correct and needs no amplification. For this reason, my group will give its consent to enhanced cooperation. There were also some contrary opinions among us – this is quite legitimate and these voices should be heard. However, what the rapporteur, Council Presidency and Commissioner have had to say shows that the time has really come and that we cannot drag our feet any longer. It is not the case, as some people claim, that this has all been agreed in haste without any discussion – like many of the other arguments, this is patently untrue. The language issue did not just become the subject of debate when the Commission presented its last proposal last year; this has been under discussion for a decade or more. There is nothing new about it. Anyone who looks at how different models have been presented and discussed in recent months cannot say that there has not been sufficient discussion. It is time to cut the Gordian knot! The second argument always used here is that we risk destroying the internal market. The fact is that we do not have an internal market where patents are concerned, so we cannot really destroy it. If – as has been the case for a long time – we are clear about the fact that the internal market really does need a uniform patent process in order to reach completion, then the entire internal market cannot be destroyed by this move. In the worst case scenario, things would remain as they are. I do believe that we will make progress, however. The third specific argument used is that Parliament would weaken its rights by consenting to enhanced cooperation: none of this is true. I would advise you to take a look at the Treaty of Lisbon and our Rules of Procedure. We will not relinquish a single right. We are now approving enhanced cooperation and, when this begins, we shall all have our individual rights. With regard to the language regime, of course this is simply a matter of consultation, since unanimity is required here. Codecision should apply to the actual patent regulation and the approval of patent jurisdiction, however. We are not relinquishing a single right, quite the opposite in fact. Bernhard Rapkay,  
rapporteur.

 Madam President, Mr Almunia, ladies and gentlemen, firstly, I would like to congratulate you, Mr Almunia, and your offices. The impact assessment that you have presented is very good. It is based on facts, it is conclusive and it gets to the point. It is a pity that the other members of the College of Commissioners have not read this impact assessment, because if they had read it, they would not have been able to present this proposal, which has nothing at all to do with the impact assessment. I wonder how the College of Commissioners picked the year, for example. There is absolutely no mention of this in the impact assessment. The only thing which might explain it is that 2014 is exactly halfway between 2010 and 2018. That is what it must be. However, it may be that they have also not understood the content. None of the arguments in favour of this proposal can be seriously considered because they are not correct. There is the argument that the State aid scheme adopted in 2002, which is about to expire, was a phasing out arrangement for coal mining. Of course, this is totally incorrect. It was a successor arrangement. I know this, because I was there and I was the rapporteur for Parliament in 2002. This is when the Treaty establishing the European Coal and Steel Community (ECSC) expired after 50 years and a successor arrangement was needed, not only with regard to aid, but also other issues. If this had been a phasing out arrangement, what would have happened, for example, to the ECSC’s assets? It was not a phasing out arrangement, it was a successor arrangement. At the time, we agreed with good reason on a period of eight years for this successor arrangement, after which we would look at the issue again. Therefore, this argument is incorrect. The second argument which is put forward is the question of sustainability. We are all in favour of this and we know that coal, of course, produces large quantities of CO2
 emissions. However, a decision made by the Commission cannot abolish the laws of science. What will happen next? Domestic coal will be replaced by imported coal. That is the only thing that will happen. Imported coal emits just the same amount of CO2
 as domestic coal. The problem is simply that if we no longer have reference points, we will not be able to use them in the development of new, state-of-the-art technologies for mining and power stations. Europe is a leader in this area and has an export advantage. I do not believe that we should just give this up. The third argument is that aid is harmful and that the money would be better spent on other things. It is not possible to say anything against this argument or against the attitude of market radicals. You cannot oppose an ideology with facts. However, the statement that this would be too expensive, for example, should be looked at in the light of what it would really mean if mining were to be stopped abruptly, and 2014 would be an abrupt stop. It would result in an increase in the costs of combating unemployment and, above all, in the costs relating to long-term pit closures. This is a very complicated and complex subject. The costs of long-term pit closures continue to be incurred years and even decades after coal mining comes to an end. The costs have to be paid out of the public purse. However, some Member States have a system in place which ensures that the state is not responsible for these costs. Therefore, this argument also does not hold water. For this reason, I recommend that you think this over again as soon as possible and that you pay attention to what is said in the impact assessment. Otherwise, the result will be regional and socio-political distortions, which we do not want. This is why the 2018 proposal is highly sensible. Bernhard Rapkay,  
rapporteur.
 – (DE)
 Madam President, Mr Almunia, that is exactly the problem. You are right when you confirm to Mr Lange that it is a Council regulation. However, it also depends on whether the Commission hears the arguments put forward in the Council and here in Parliament. You must drop this very stringent proposal, as you have done, so that it is possible for a sensible, democratic approach to be taken, which involves a majority decision that does not require unanimity. I would like to make a second remark to Mr Chatzimarkakis. The review clause which you referred to is completely irrelevant in this case. The disputes which took place in Germany were only intended to save the face of the Minister for Economic Affairs there, nothing more. Now, I would like to look at the concern expressed by Mr Almunia. No one here and not even the report itself is questioning the fact that this is a phasing out arrangement, Mr Almunia. Whether it is sensible in terms of energy policy or technology is another question. What Mr Geier said is absolutely correct, but we are not calling that into question. The only question is whether we should do this relatively abruptly in 2014 or whether there are sensible transitional arrangements for 2018. Otherwise, we are not questioning anything. The situation is not as described by Mr Lambert, for example, who read out his speech and then left. He should have stayed here, because he might have learned something. It is not the case that there are Member States who have done nothing at all. That is not true of Spain, of Poland, of Romania or of Germany. In 1990, more than 200 000 people were working in the mining industry in Germany. Now, 20 years later, the figure is around 20 000. This represents a drop of 90%, leaving only 10% of the jobs still in place. There have been a number of pit closures between 2002 and the present day during the period of this regulation, which is still in force. Let us not behave as if nothing has happened. The question is whether or not we need a sensible transitional period to be able to achieve this without causing socio-political damage. I can only say, yes, we do need one. This four-year period should not be an issue, because no one is calling that into question anyway. Please take that message back to the Commission. Bernhard Rapkay,  
rapporteur.
 – (DE)
 Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, and when I say ‘ladies and gentlemen’, I include you, Baroness Ashton, Mr Šefčovič, your team and the Council Presidency, because, at the end of the day, we experienced collegial cooperation, without which we would surely not have achieved the result that we did. I am happy with the result, at least as regards the part for which I was responsible and where I had a grasp of the overall picture. However, I would say that this is not so very surprising, because it is not as if we have only just started. Mr President, it was a very clever idea of yours to call all the rapporteurs together on a regular basis for an exchange of ideas right from an early stage – back at the time of the Brok, Verhofstadt and Gualtieri reports. As a result, for the relevant people, it was clear what would need to be done later, and for those who were to do this later work, it was clear what had already been done in terms of preparatory work. For this reason, it was primarily a matter of applying to the Staff Regulations the organisational aspects of what had been agreed between Parliament and the Council in connection with the establishment of the European External Action Service in the particular areas of competence covered by these Staff Regulations. When I say organisational, I mean that organisation is policy and policy is organisation. That is, of course, something that we found repeatedly during the detailed negotiations, because it was already clear at that point that perhaps one person may interpret something one way and others may interpret it somewhat differently. However, the spirit of cooperation resulted, I believe, in us finding very sensible solutions to such issues. What did we actually need to do, then, in terms of policy adjustment and what did we need to lay down in the Staff Regulations? Firstly, we had to incorporate the equal treatment of the three staffing components. I want to mention this point because, as you know, the treaty states that the staff of the EEAS shall comprise officials from the Commission, the Council and from the diplomatic services of the Member States. The last of these elements, in particular, did pose something of an issue, as it was something new. We had to resolve the almost antagonistic contradiction between the Community approach and the intergovernmental approach. It goes without saying that the Council and the Member States take more of an intergovernmental approach, while we prefer the Community approach. I believe I can say that we then worked out a solution to this together. To that extent, then, we can be very satisfied. What we needed, and indeed must continue, to take into account is gender balance and a balance in terms of geographical origin. We want to have a service that is modern, including with regard to the issue of gender equality. I am pleased, Baroness Ashton, that, in addition to what we have incorporated into the Staff Regulations as mandatory, you have assured us that you will make another personal statement, which will form part of the whole package. That already represents considerable progress with regard to both the aspect of gender equality and the other aspect of geographical balance. We need equal rights and equal obligations, and that includes loyalty – and indeed from all three components – towards the institution of the High Representative, currently embodied by Baroness Ashton. In this regard, we had a bit of additional work to do as far as the veto right of the diplomatic services was concerned in connection with possible extensions to the contracts of staff coming from the diplomatic services. However, we resolved this, too. There is one issue that should not be underestimated. We jointly agreed that this issue cannot be accommodated in the Staff Regulations. This is the fact that the new European diplomatic service also needs something of a separate identity. Everyone working there must be working towards the same goal and therefore, a common form of training and further training is also extremely important. That was especially important to some of my fellow negotiators, and I can understand that. I have just said that we did not succeed in doing this. It was clear that it would not be possible to incorporate something like this into the Staff Regulations systematically. However, here, once again, I have to thank the High Representative, because I have been informed that she also wants to say something about this and that she regards it as a major obligation and a major necessity and will also make another declaration of commitment in this regard, which, although not a component of the Staff Regulations, will reassure us and those who view it as particularly important as we look to the future work of the common External Action Service. Bearing all that in mind, we have done a very good job, and the service is now set for a sound start on 1 December. Bernhard Rapkay,  
rapporteur.

 Madam President, after my speech at the start of this debate, I actually only have two more comments to make. The first, which I quite deliberately left to the end of the debate, is that I would like to thank all of the shadow rapporteurs for their friendly and constructive cooperation. It is quite simply easier to negotiate when you know that your colleagues support you. For that reason, these were not the most difficult of negotiations. My second comment, however, is one that I would like to reiterate with regard to what has repeatedly been at the centre of this debate, namely, the question of geographical balance. Mrs Neynsky stole the show by saying that the compromise states nothing at all about this. I would simply suggest that, once we have adopted this, she quietly and calmly reads the text. Read the text! Reading the text will enlighten the mind. Then you will see that the compromise most definitely does contain statements – and indeed very strict, legally binding statements – on this matter. Then all of your concerns should, in fact, be dispelled. Matthias Groote and Bernhard Rapkay  (S&amp;D

 The German Social Democratic (SPD) delegation in the European Parliament is in favour of combating international terrorism and providing permanent protection for personal data with the highest possible degree of determination and effectiveness. In view of the importance of data protection, the SPD delegation did not make its decision lightly. After long and careful consideration, however, we are now able to vote in favour of the agreement: the Social Democrats have succeeded in providing for the establishment of permanent European monitoring in connection with the extraction of the data directly on the ground in the US Treasury Department – including the facility to stop the extraction of data. For us, the top priority was limiting the transfer of bulk data. SEPA data are not covered by the agreement; most transfers are not affected at all. The five-year data retention period is intended to be reviewed annually, whereby any data that is not needed is to be deleted sooner than this. In addition, an annual review of compliance with all data protection standards, with the involvement of data protection supervisors, is provided for. Even though we would have preferred the monitoring role and the transfer of data to be given to a judicial authority, Europol must carry out its mandate for approving the data transfer, provided for in the agreement, under the strict scrutiny of the EU. Although Europol has a reliable data protection system, it needs to be brought into line with the Treaty of Lisbon so that it can perform its duties under full democratic scrutiny.

 As the Committee on Legal Affairs’ rapporteur for the European External Action Service, I would like to point out that, including as a result of its amendments to Article 6 of the High Representative’s proposal, the report that has been agreed on today has absolutely no binding effect for me as rapporteur or for the European Parliament as a whole in the discussions on the adaptation of the Staff Regulations. This includes, in particular, the footnotes that were adopted in the text today. A report on a legislative proposal on which the European Parliament was only consulted cannot have any binding effect for the areas in which the European Parliament, by virtue of a different legal basis, has the power of codecision. Birgit Sippel  (S&amp;D

Mr President, almost everything has been said that needs to be said, so I will keep it brief. Why data retention? After all, food stocks have to be replaced sooner or later. That means consuming or using the food and buying a new lot. At the beginning, the debate about data retention focused on its use in anti-terrorism. In practice, however, these data are available, so apparently they have to be used, and they are accessed to investigate a very wide range of crimes, including minor or moderately serious offences. Moreover, in the process, there is a growing data hunger that is driving the storage of types of data that were not originally envisaged. The volume of data is growing. At the very least, then, we must reduce the amount of data stored, the types of use, and the duration of storage. We must protect data from abusive forms of access and use. We should be open to discussing alternatives to the current practice, and we must be mindful of one principle above all: that the rule of law and the protection of civil rights are key pillars of governance in our countries and the EU. They must be respected and defended, if necessary by abolishing the Directive. Birgit Sippel  (S&amp;D

Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, naturally it is possible to revise constitutions, media laws, Schengen rules and many other things. However there are rules. If the suspicion exists that existing laws and the values of the European Union are being violated, then this is something that must be pursued, whether in Hungary and Romania, or in France or Denmark, or any other country that could give cause for concern. I wonder, however, not just in view of the present debate, whether all those involved are really concerned with an objective clarification of events, or whether they are not more interested in party political mud-slinging or scoring party political points through sound-bites. This will not help us win back the confidence of our citizens. We need to arrange for an objective investigation to be carried out, using the same yardstick for all Member States, rather than different standards depending on whether we are located in the north, south, east or west of the European Union. If we consider the issue at the heart of these matters rather than relying on rumours and newspaper reports, then this discussion will have added value for the people of Hungary, Romania, France and Germany, and everyone else. Birgit Sippel  (S&amp;D

Mr President, let me state quite plainly from the start that freedom of movement within the EU is not a national right and thus cannot be restricted solely on a national basis. As the only elected European institution, the European Parliament must be fully consulted and given a say on all questions, whether relating to changes in the Schengen area or violations of Schengen rules. The reference to serious deficiencies at our external borders is dubious and factually incorrect. That is because the issue at stake is not just border controls, but also the excessive demands on some states immediately to investigate the legal status of every single refugee, thereby establishing clear perspectives for them. As Europeans, we must meet these challenges together, rather than sowing the seeds of uncertainty among our citizens with a crassly populist approach. This joint approach would be effective for our countries and our citizens, as well as for the refugees themselves. We should not regress to a parochial standpoint, because the fact is we need more Europe, not less. Birgit Sippel  (S&amp;D

Mr President, a number of years ago, terrorist attacks were given as the reason for introducing measures such as the retention of data or PNR. Obviously, terrorism alone is no longer enough to justify this gathering of data to our citizens, however. That is why we are currently talking about serious and organised crime and debating human trafficking; however the fact is that despite the millions of data records already on file, there have only been a few isolated successes so far. Ms Malmström argues that data protection has been improved, referring in particular to the fact that some data will be retained for ‘only’ 10 years. Data protection begins at an earlier stage, however, for example when a specific limitation of purpose is applied or when restricting the data that needs to be collected. What is it that the agreement that is to be voted on today allows? The retention of millions of data records relating mostly to completely innocent citizens, that will be checked and rechecked with different criteria for almost every conceivable purpose for the next 10 years. Other criminal activities are punishable with a custodial sentence of three years. The German Government has this to say on its website: Those travelling to the US should consider that some offences that do not even warrant a judicial process in Germany are punishable with custodial sentences of several years in the US. Penalties must apply across borders. According to the wording, it is sufficient for the suspect to intend to cross the border. This is something we all want to do when we travel to the US, as we already have the ticket for our return flight in our pockets. Furthermore, any court can demand this information. Will we have better data protection? In view of the broad range of applications, the possibility of data being forwarded to other authorities and to third countries is more than questionable. It is also regrettable that there is at present no provision for the participation of data protection specialists in the planned evaluation. At this point I do not wish to go into the fact that, in the US, terrorist suspects frequently remain in prison for several years awaiting official charges. A number of these people are innocent. We need to combat terrorism. However, this formulation clearly goes too far. Every citizen comes under suspicion and is delivered up to the US legal system, instead of protecting our values and the rights of our people. I have one final comment: Mr Albrecht asked whether those who vote in favour of the agreement should feel ashamed. No, no one should be ashamed about the way they vote today. Nonetheless, I am extremely concerned at the direction we would take by adopting this agreement and for this reason I am absolutely against it. Birgit Sippel  (S&amp;D

 Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, in the light of the history of the Hungarian people, it is particularly tragic that their own government is now withholding important rights from the citizens of Hungary. I would like to say to some speakers that even if a party was really elected by two-thirds of the people entitled to vote, it still has a specific responsibility in a democratic system to ensure that the political minority can present its views in the media and that the political minority is personally represented in the media, in the judiciary and in other areas. This is a principle which lies at the heart of democratic systems and it is a tragedy that this is not happening. The fact that we have to hold this debate today, and it is a good thing that we are doing so, is not just a result of the way in which the Hungarian Government is acting. It is also because the Council was not able in the past in the case of Hungary and in other situations to take up a clear position and to put the European values centre stage. It is also the fault of the European Commission, which has so far failed in its role as guardian of the Treaties. In the case of the independence of the judiciary, it is not about checking whether the change in the upper age limit for judges is in line with the anti-discrimination directive, instead we need to evaluate the entire package. Is the assumption justified that in future only members of a certain party will be represented in certain areas? I believe that, in the current difficult situation and in order to overcome the major challenges which face us, we need all the Member States and all the citizens of the European Union. For this reason, we must focus on values and not on individual laws. Birgit Sippel,  (S&amp;D

Madam President, I would like to propose a minor addition on behalf of my group in order to ensure that the rights of children and mothers are respected after sentencing. We would like to make an insertion after paragraph 4. I will read our proposal in English:  Reaffirms the importance of granting specific protection to mother detainees and to their children including through the use of alternative measures to detention in the child’s best interest, and calls on Member States and the Commission to actively promote and support such initiatives’.

 Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, why is it even necessary, in this House, in this European Union, to discuss detention conditions? The increasing mobility of our citizens and, in particular, the increased cooperation between the police force and the judicial system, as well as joint measures such as the European arrest warrant, require confidence. This is the confidence that everywhere in the EU, the Charter of Fundamental Rights and the Convention on Human Rights are being observed. It is confidence in properly functioning legal systems based on the principle of the presumption of innocence, in which a punishment is a punishment, not revenge or humiliation. However, many reports in the last few years and also many judgments of the European Court of Human Rights make it clear that we are still a long way from achieving this. The poor conditions relate to overcrowded prisons, a lack of opportunities for contact, a lack of medical care and many other issues besides. We urgently need common minimum standards for detention conditions and also for pre-trial detention. Long pre-trial detention periods, particularly if it is not in the person’s own Member State, can result in the loss of social contacts and jobs and, due to language barriers, they can entail isolation during detention. Therefore, in particular with regard to minor offences, alternatives to all forms of detention must be given greater consideration. The Commission’s Green Paper cites a number of examples in this regard. However, these need to be applied a great deal more in practice. The conclusion, then, is that minimum standards for detention conditions, a greater use of alternatives and special forms of accommodation for pregnant women and children are essential steps for us to take. The European Parliament has already called for changes to detention conditions in the past. Now, we must finally take specific measures. That is what we are calling for most strongly today and tomorrow. Birgit Sippel

 Mr President, Commissioner Reding, ladies and gentlemen, in the current times it is more important than ever to keep repeating that the European Union is more than just a market. It is a community of values, and it is precisely in difficult times that it must prove itself to be a strong community of values in all policy areas. The EU and its Member States are based on the common principles of freedom, democracy and the rule of law. An indispensable element of the rule of law in the context of criminal proceedings is the presumption of innocence, supported by clear and comprehensive procedural rights for the accused persons. Following the directive on the right to interpretation and to translation, the new directive on the right to information in criminal proceedings is a further important cornerstone in ensuring that suspected and accused persons are given a fair trial across the EU. The development of equal standards for procedural rights in criminal matters will strengthen our citizens’ trust in the judicial systems of the Member States. The mutual recognition of court decisions will also encourage this. An individual can only comprehensively exercise his procedural rights if he knows what those rights are. For a fair trial, it is crucial that people are aware of their rights and that they know what the accusation against them is. If authorities fail to observe these procedural rights, then they jeopardise the fairness of the proceedings and risk miscarriages of justice. The existing EU legal framework in the judicial area focuses on improved cooperation between judicial authorities. In contrast, the new directive concentrates on our citizens and the rights they enjoy in criminal proceedings. It states that police officers and prosecutors must provide people who have been arrested with written information concerning their rights in simple terms in a language they can understand. In addition to the right to interpretation and translation, this includes in particular informing them of the accusation against them, of the right to legal assistance and of the right to be heard by a judge without delay following arrest. In addition, Parliament has been able to expand the specific rights of which the suspect is to be informed. We have succeeded in integrating into the directive the right of access to medical assistance, the right to communication with relatives and the right to remain silent. No one knows in advance how long a suspected person will remain in pre-trial detention, for how long he will be deprived of his liberty. It is therefore important that he is informed of his rights at an early stage and is also given access to material evidence for and against him. The accused person must not become the object of the criminal proceedings, but rather must be able to play an active part in the proceedings. The Member States must now adopt and implement the directive as soon as possible. Finally, I would like to offer my thanks to the services of Parliament and of the Commission – and I would particularly like to thank the shadow rapporteurs, whose perseverance and really outstanding cooperation have made this report possible. It is now important that the Council and Commission bring the follow-up measures to this directive to a rapid conclusion jointly with the European Parliament, thereby creating uniform standards and fair trials throughout the EU. Birgit Sippel 
, rapporteur.

 Mr President, I believe Ms Reding has said it already; today’s debate has underlined once again what the unanimous decision in the Committee on Civil Liberties, Justice and Home Affairs made clear – namely that strengthening procedural rights is a concern of us all, whatever group we belong to and, to a certain extent, whichever Member State we represent. I therefore hope – and I am very confident about this – that we will again get a good proposal from the Commission for the next measure, which is the right to a lawyer; that we will be able to improve on this even further and that, following our discussions with the Council, we will once again be able to achieve a very good directive. I wish the rapporteur, Ms Antonescu, all the best with this and I believe she can count on the support of this House. Birgit Sippel  (S&amp;D

Madam President, the directive on combating the sexual abuse, sexual exploitation of children and child pornography sends out a clear message. This subject is an important one and one that concerns the whole of Europe, and uniform rules for the definition of offences and also for the penalties apply universally. Common arrangements for the prosecution of crimes committed outside the EU are still needed. The same applies to common standards for calling legal persons to account. The directive gives specific penalty options in this regard. One key area, however, was offences committed on the Internet. Here ‘grooming’ is now made punishable. It is also important that all Member States are obliged to take measures to get websites containing child pornography deleted. However, in addition to this there remains an important requirement for all institutions of the European Union, in their international cooperation with other states, to ensure that the principle of deletion should take precedence in other countries of the world, too. A great deal of abuse takes place in real life in our children’s immediate environment. Therefore, prevention mechanisms are particularly important, as is instruction in the use of media, so that, when using new media, our children and young people are able to recognise the sources of danger. Protection measures are obviously particularly important from the point of view of those affected, both for children during criminal proceedings and also in the form of special support for children and their families outside the context of such proceedings. The Member States have a particular duty here. Overall, after difficult negotiations, we have obtained a good directive. Following its adoption, it will be up to the Member States to implement it and put it into practice as quickly and as comprehensively as possible. To finish I would like to make one more personal comment. Even though a different decision has now been taken, I would have liked there to be correlation tables for all directives in future. The fact that we will not now have this quick overview of the implementation of measures is something that I personally find very disappointing. Birgit Sippel,  
on behalf of the S&amp;D Group

 Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, PNR data is nothing new – after all this information has been gathered since commercial aviation was in its infancy. Likewise, the use of this data, for example for border control purposes, is nothing new. Nonetheless, a problem arises here which is also familiar in other areas: in an increasingly mobile world with modern information technology, data is available in quite different dimensions than was the case 50 or even 30 years ago. This is also the reason why data protection is becoming increasingly important. We have achieved a great deal with this agreement: a clear definition of potential uses, good data protection standards and clear rules for legal certainty and judicial remedy. The changeover from the pull system to the push system is also important. Data is not simply collected, but is sent to Australia. We have not been able to achieve all our demands, however. One of the major points at issue from our perspective is the five-and-a-half-year retention period. We would have liked to see a much shorter period. So, what can we do about it? Do we vote in favour of the agreement or do we reject it? I would like to make two comments. We will never achieve one hundred per cent of our demands. So, we need to weigh things up. Data would continue to be transferred even if we rejected the agreement, however then we would have no clear rules on how this data should be handled. That is why I hope that this agreement will receive majority support tomorrow, despite many reservations. In relation to the forthcoming agreement with the US, I would like to state clearly: we want an agreement here too, but a 15-year retention period is a much longer time. I genuinely fail to see why we cannot change over completely to the push system here. We need to make improvements in this area. We want uniform standards for all agreements in relation to PNR data, rather than a patchwork of arrangements in which the rights of our citizens are dealt with in different ways. Birgit Sippel  (S&amp;D

Madam President, the new mandate for Frontex is a contribution to bringing about the situation whereby, whilst our borders are given the necessary protection, human rights are observed and those seeking protection actually receive it. There are many areas where I would have liked to have seen something better, for example, when it comes to independent observers. Yet whatever you may think of this new mandate, the situation will remain a patchwork. In all the criticism of Frontex – including the justified criticism – one point is often overlooked, and that is the participation and responsibility of the Member States in their collaboration with the agency. Unfortunately, they are not something that we can reform! It would be an important further step though, if we could finally, for example, put in place a uniform and improved European asylum system. The new Frontex mandate may be a step in the right direction, but critical follow-up continues to be absolutely necessary. The discussion about protecting our borders and about the rights of refugees will not be concluded simply as a result of this new mandate. Birgit Sippel

 Madam President, I must admit to the House that I am a little confused where the debate on passenger name records (PNR) is concerned, because the facts and the issues that need to be clarified are not new. Nonetheless, one gets the impression that we are not making any progress – worse still, that we are moving back to worse conditions than those previously agreed. The signing of the agreement with Australia is currently also stalled because the Member States have asked for more time to review it. I fear that the reality is somewhat different, but I would like to hope that this has something to do with the fact that the Member States, too, have realised that not every means is justified in the fight against terror. As most of us here will remember, negotiations on the SWIFT Agreement were very difficult, but were eventually brought to a successful conclusion. I am astonished that we are now moving at a different level as regards data protection and data security, and I get the impression that we are back to standards below those that we have agreed previously. A retention period of 15 years is far too long. In the case of the 11 September 2001 attack that was so incisive for the US, for example, 15-year-old data would have been no help whatsoever because the perpetrators were much too young for data that was so old to have had any relevance. In my view, there is a very close link between proportionality and the use of data for a particular purpose. You cannot collect millions of data records from innocent citizens for 15 years and then say: ‘Actually, we are going to use this data for everything’, as is currently stated in the text of the US agreement. That is not acceptable. I would like to make it quite clear that this requirement applies not just to the US, but also to the Commission and to our Member States. If you adopt a measure to fight terrorism and serious international crime, then this measure must be limited to precisely that and cannot be expanded to allow other areas to be included by the back door.

 Madam President, in the debate on the Hungarian constitution, we heard more than once the criticism that it was a political debate. I am completely taken aback by that, because having political debates is one of the things that Parliament is expressly there to do; and I therefore want to start this topic by setting out the political framework too. Crime, and organised crime in particular, has never been held back by borders or border controls. It therefore makes no sense to rebuild borders in Europe and to restrict the way our populations are growing together. On the contrary: what we need is the consistent further development of cooperation between our Member States and cross-border cooperation by the police and justice authorities. In this area, the European Arrest Warrant has repeatedly proven itself to be an important and successful instrument. At the same time, however, this instrument will fall into disrepute if European Arrest Warrants are used for, say, stolen bicycles, or merely in order to carry out questioning. I regret to say that we have also found that it is being used when perhaps it has been decided not to execute an arrest warrant because there is evidence to show that it was unjustly issued and this is then not respected by the issuing Member State – resulting in the unfortunate situation in which the citizens concerned are repeatedly arrested whenever they cross a border. That does nothing to help build confidence in European legal systems. Why is this happening? Does the text of the directive leave too much leeway? Is it a matter of incorrect implementation in the Member States or inadequate information? We need to clarify these points, the Member States need to make improvements where necessary, and the Commission must take action to prevent such misuse. That is the only way to prevent a successful instrument being permanently damaged and confidence in these measures being lost. Moreover, all these experiences show how important it is that we finally make some progress on the road map for procedural rights. In the interests of legal certainty for everyone involved, we need to have the same rights across Europe for those accused of offences and there must be mandatory information on these rights. I call on the Commission to exert pressure to counter possible opposition on all these points; I am sure it can count on the support of Parliament in this. (The speaker agreed to take a blue-card question under Rule 149(8)) Birgit Sippel

 I am not sure whether I should answer your question, as it is more of a polemic comment. However, the figures show that the European Arrest Warrant is an appropriate instrument for fighting crime in the unified space of Europe. Crime is not national; crime is international and crosses borders. That is why we need to cooperate across borders. We need to deal with the teething problems of the European Arrest Warrant and stop it being misused. As an instrument, however, it is indispensable. Birgit Sippel,  
on behalf of the S&amp;D Group.

Madam President, in a globalised world, terrorism and crime are, unfortunately, also globally organised, and therefore we know that we need to cooperate internationally and need to exchange data. I am very pleased to hear that both the Commission and the Council consider that citizens’ rights and data protection are both matters to be accorded very high priority. However, that does not mean that Parliament can rest on its laurels, since issues such as retention periods, data volumes and purpose limitation, as well as controls and whether protective clauses can really be implemented in the area of data protection, will remain critical points. In this sensitive area, what we need is not blind checks, but more trust. The terms on which data is exchanged must therefore also be set at a particularly high level, since it is not just a matter of specific agreements with Australia and the US; a number of other countries such as Korea and India also already want to have PNR agreements with us. For this reason, too, it is very important that we build in particularly high security standards at this point. The same applies to the forwarding of data to third countries. Here again, we must examine very carefully the terms that we want to incorporate. At the same time, when discussing PNR data, we also need to look beyond this. What is the point of keeping the volume of data as low as possible when negotiating on PNR if the US, as a countermove, announces that it wishes not only to levy an entry fee, but also to collect additional data from passengers? We also have a problem within the European Union. What is the point of agreeing the highest possible standards and attempting to limit data volumes if, at the same time, bilateral agreements are being concluded without us having any knowledge of their content and security standards? Mrs Malmström has said that this is not about PNR data, but rather that all data that is collected should apparently serve the purpose of fighting terrorism and combating crime. I would therefore like to end by making one more request: what we need is not just good provisions on the individual measures, but also at last to take an overall view of all the measures, all the data that is transferred by the EU and the Member States. We need to be quite clear about this: we will never achieve one hundred percent security, however many measures we take and however much data we collect. That is a fact that we have to face up to. Birgit Sippel

 Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, the Treaty of Lisbon has been mentioned many times today. I should like to say something positive about it for once. Most of our citizens think it is a good thing that we can travel in Europe without borders, that we can move freely about Europe for the purposes of education, work and leisure. However, in so doing, we naturally leave a data trail behind us. For a long time now, our data has not just been stored in one Member State, but is spread throughout the European Union. That is precisely why it is a good thing that we have greater powers at European level in this area – which concerns the protection of data relating to European citizens – because our citizens quite rightly expect their data to be well protected everywhere in Europe and they do not expect large amounts of data to be passed on unnecessarily, possibly even to third countries. How are we, as the European Union – and I will make myself absolutely clear: as the European Parliament and Council; in other words, together with the Member States – supposed to ensure this protection if it is the case that while we, as the European Union, are negotiating with third countries on the forwarding of data – over what data is actually required, the purpose for which it is to be used and the safeguards that are necessary in order to protect this data – at the same time, individual Member States are negotiating with third countries on data? Especially since we do not even know what data they are talking about, what security standards are being maintained, whether duplicate data is possibly being forwarded, or even whether data is being forwarded that we would not allow to be forwarded at European level. There is also another aspect that the Member States are perhaps not taking into sufficient consideration. If a Member State negotiates with a third country, how then can I ensure – how can and will the individual Member State ensure – that only the data of its own citizens is, in fact, forwarded, if any data is forwarded at all? We now have databases within the European Union that collect data on all kinds of citizens at a central point and to which many authorities in European countries have access. In other words, if my data is stored somewhere in country A and country A decides to forward data, will my data also be forwarded to a third country? This cannot be the added value in the European Union that was intended when, for good reason, we negotiated the Treaty of Lisbon. The Member States, too, need to take note of the new balance of power between the institutions, must act accordingly, and must stick to the rules, which state that data protection is a European matter. We need to ensure at European level that as little data as possible is forwarded and only for narrowly defined purposes, and that this is not all undermined by bilateral initiatives.

Madam President, in his introduction, the rapporteur said that Parliament now has to support the agreement. Perhaps that was a mistranslation, but I will nevertheless make it very clear that I do not have to support this agreement and I most definitely will not support it. This first agreement following the entry into force of the Treaty of Lisbon will, in particular, send out a particularly important signal. However, what sort of signal are we sending out to the EU and beyond? Looking at the supporters of the agreement I can, above all, see a biblical principle at work: we wash our hands in innocence – after all, we have a treaty. However, we have absolutely no idea what happens to the people in these countries when we send them back. I would have liked to have seen a greater sensitivity to the issue of the treatment of refugees and of respect for human rights. The adoption of this agreement will severely jeopardise our credibility in matters of democracy and human rights. I would therefore ask all my fellow Members once again not to support this agreement. Birgit Sippel  (S&amp;D

 Mr President, a preliminary remark. To accept or to reject, either decision is worthy of respect. What is not acceptable, however, are certain exaggerations, half-truths and falsehoods, frequently devoid of any knowledge of the facts, which have also been voiced in the published debate. More objectivity and less emotion would surely have been fitting. To come to the point, fighting terrorism is just as much about the defence of democratic values and freedoms. One of these also requires the use of data, while the other requires a high degree of data protection. It is precisely here that, under pressure from the European Parliament, we were able to achieve a great deal: verification that a request is actually founded on a legitimate suspicion of terrorism, and daily checks by EU officials in the US Treasury Department that only data pertaining to suspected terrorists are being examined, including the possibility of stopping the extraction of data. We in Parliament are convinced that this important function must be regulated in agreement with all institutions. Compliance with standards, with the involvement of the Data Protection Officers, must be reviewed annually, and, for a storage period of five years, an annual audit to ensure that data which is not required is deleted in good time. To reiterate, intra-European transfers are not affected. Nonetheless, not everything was achieved. For example, Europol. I should like to ask the European Commission not to wait until 2013, but to prepare draft legislation quickly which ensures parliamentary control by means of codecision. Birgit Sippel,  
on behalf of the S&amp;D Group. 
– (DE) 
Mr President, I would like to contradict those who have spoken so far on one point: I am not interested in arriving at an agreement as soon as possible, but in achieving one that is as good as possible. Quality must come before timeframe. I would like to make one other preliminary remark. The European Parliament has already rejected an agreement once and one aspect among the many reasons relating to content was the lack of European Parliament participation. In view of current events this week, we have decided not to adopt any decisions here in Parliament. Then there is the decision to call on the Council to likewise postpone its decisions until we can adopt our decisions. I am now rather surprised that there are Members of the House, who clearly do not take their own decisions seriously but think: well yes, despite this, the Council can simply decide. I do not think we can treat our own decisions like that. I still maintain that the Council should also withhold its decision until after 6 May when we have decided. I am sure there are no disadvantages to this and that the United States would be understanding. As for the draft mandate itself, I take a favourable view of the fact that the Commission is committed to meeting our demands. Nevertheless, I would like to say clearly that there still need to be substantial amendments to this negotiating mandate. These are necessary if a majority of the European Parliament is to vote in favour of a new agreement. In my opinion, the current mandate is not ambitious enough to achieve this. The problem of bulk data transfer remains unresolved. If the US authorities tell us that every month we are talking about the specific details of five to ten people, then the transfer of millions of pieces of data relating to European citizens is surely disproportionate to this purpose. Incidentally, I would like to say again to the Commission and the Council that although it is constantly maintained that this agreement will be highly significant as an additional means of combating terrorism, the proof of this is not as clear as we are always being told. The long period of retention of data in the United States also continues to be a problem. The mandate does not offer a solution here either. We need a judicial authority on European soil that not only checks the legality of US applications, but also the extraction of data, wherever this takes place. The transmission of information to third countries must be regulated with clear directives. We need an ambitious mandate with our demands. Only then can we achieve a really good result that meets our demands, taking into account data protection as well as the fight against terror. Finally, I have another specific question for the Council and the Commission. How do you intend to ensure that only data that was specifically requested is extracted and passed on? How can that work? In the United States? Or are there other proposals? Birgit Sippel,  
on behalf of the S&amp;D Group.

Madam President, there are a few basic things I would like to say about this agreement. There are, by all means, similarities with SWIFT, but also differences. If the European Parliament had to vote today on the Passenger Name Record (PNR) agreement, we would have no other option but to vote no. That is quite clear. There are still significant objections to this agreement. I will go into the details once more shortly. That is why I was not happy when we spoke about postponing the vote. However, unlike SWIFT, there were definitely good reasons for this postponement. Nevertheless, I will say quite clearly that, for us, it does not mean that the vote can be postponed indefinitely, so that we now have a provisional agreement for years on end. It is very important to us that we quickly reach a new negotiating mandate and, if possible, before the summer break, so that we can quickly gain clarity in detailed questions on how we should handle this data and what data should be included. Data protection plays an important role and here, I would like to use the opportunity to address once again the question as to what data should be transmitted. PNR covers 19 individual pieces of data. I know from conversations I have had that it is of course possible – if you want to – to create personality profiles from these pieces of data. Now, of course, those with whom we have such an agreement are saying they have no interest in this, they will not do it and that relevant data is erased. However, if certain data that could be used to create a personality profile is not used at all, then we must consider whether it should indeed be collected, or – if we reach an agreement – whether all of the data needs to be transmitted. That is a crucial question. We also have to check what level of protection is afforded to data that is transmitted. We know that the regulations in both agreements with the USA and Australia are very different. With a view to further requests by other countries that want to have similar agreements, we should ensure that every time we reach an agreement, special standards apply. We also have to consider in detail the question of how this data is to be used. Originally, it was always said that it was about combating terrorism. Now however, it is also about serious crime. This can be discussed. However, we must go into great detail here. We know that even within the European Union itself, legal systems and legal culture vary greatly. This may mean that the definition of what constitutes a serious crime is completely different in terms of the type of crime. That means we need to look again in detail at what we are discussing when we say that serious crime should also naturally be included. I hope that in future, with the implementation of the agreement, we ensure that there is a regular exchange of information between the institutions. The President-in-Office of the Council has indicated that there has been a first review as far as the agreement with the USA is concerned. Officially, we still do not have these results yet. That was in February. In future, I would not only like to see reports being drawn up regularly, I would also like to see these reports actually being made available to the European Parliament immediately. It is very important to create a uniform agreement. The issue of data must be reviewed again. However, I believe that, on the basis of the previous discussion, we will probably reach a good agreement, and I therefore view further negotiations as something entirely positive. Birgit Sippel  (S&amp;D

 Mr President, anyone who has followed the many discussions about SWIFT over recent weeks might get the impression that without SWIFT, we would descend into chaos and that rejecting the agreement would bring an end to the transatlantic relationship and the joint war on terror. These attempts to threaten us can be described in one word: ridiculous. The US and the Council are not trying to rescue an essential tool; they are simply saving face. There are many agreements and measures in place to combat terrorism. SWIFT could be a useful addition to these. The failed attack on 25 December has clearly demonstrated that it is not data we are lacking, but the ability to make effective use of the data which we already have. The idea is to divert attention away from this fact. The interim agreement simply could not be worse. It is full of contradictions and inconsistencies. Instead of suitable precautions being taken to ensure that only data relating to people who are actually under suspicion is transferred, huge volumes of data will be sent to the US every month. The agreement represents a flagrant breach of citizens’ rights, data protection and the principles of the rule of law. If the Council and the US were really prepared to take on board this criticism and to incorporate these points into a new agreement, then there would be no need for us to accept this dreadful agreement. In the interests of the citizens, we must say no to the interim agreement and we must start new negotiations immediately, so that we can put in place a really good agreement which acts as an additional, effective tool for combating terrorism and which preserves our fundamental rights.

 Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, we should discuss today’s debate, and particularly the decisions which follow the discussion, not from a formal, but rather a political perspective. Uniform standards for laboratory work are, of course, also important for cooperation between the police and the judiciary that is based on trust. However, there are many aspects of this matter which time does not permit us to discuss. In principle, however, the core issue is altogether different, namely how seriously the political acteurs
 take the Treaty of Lisbon, the rights of the Parliament and the citizens, as well as the trustworthy cooperation of the Council and the Parliament. I would like to give three examples: the Treaty of Lisbon describes the High Representative as a strong voice for Europe, and it is a great shame that the Member States have clearly also applied different criteria in this case. The agreement on SWIFT codes, which is controversial in many ways, could once again be subjected to careful scrutiny by the European Parliament next Monday. Instead, it is to be quickly ticked off the list a few hours beforehand and signed with the United States. We are facing the same situation with the topics we are dealing with here. Shortly before the Treaty of Lisbon enters into force, we are being asked to quickly push through decisions, which include provisions for the future which will limit our scope for making decisions, or at least significantly restrict them. We have to ask ourselves why this is the case, as it was certainly possible to submit new proposals on other issues. The Council’s and the Commission’s stance lost them the chance to send a clear message to the people of Europe, a sign of commitment to implementing the treaty, a sign of a democratic Europe of the citizens. We, the European Parliament, have only one option: we must reject these proposals, as we want a broad public debate and we want to use our strengthened rights to support the citizens now, rather than in the near or more distant future. Constanze Angela Krehl  (S&amp;D

 Mr President, this morning we have talked a great deal about targeted growth in the European Union. The cohesion policy is a European investment programme that we have at our disposal for creating growth. For this reason, we need at least as much money in the future budget as we have had available to date. The Friends of Cohesion are not against better spending of the money. However, I am not sure whether the friends of better spending in the Council really want good cohesion policy, which is something we need in order to overcome the crisis. There is a second point I would like to mention. In the negotiation box, which has also been mentioned frequently here, 90% of all points in the area of cohesion policy are basically decided with the European Parliament in the ordinary legislative procedure. Please would you accept that this time, for the first time, Parliament is involved in the ordinary legislative procedure for all areas of cohesion policy. The negotiations in committee will be complete in mid-July. We will then have a mandate and be able to negotiate. I hope that the Council will be prepared to do the same at that time.

 Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, it has so often been said that small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs) lie at the heart of the European Union’s economy and this is indeed the case. We are doing a great deal for them. I believe that this is something really special because, in contrast to other large economic areas, we have smaller companies which are competitive on global markets and which are flexible enough to adapt to changing conditions. That is the special feature of SMEs in the European Union and we are providing them with support. They are at the centre of our structural policy not just in the next subsidy period, but also here and now. We have done a lot to ensure that they can access the money from the Structural Funds more easily. However, I believe that there is potential for further improvement and simplification in this area. When a small company applies for a loan at favourable interest rates, it should not be necessary for the company to fill out reams of forms. I think that there is still room for improvement here. However, I also believe that by means of an intelligent initiative, we can encourage SMEs to create closer links between economic growth, an innovative approach to economic development and the struggle to reduce youth unemployment levels. Mr Hahn said in a previous debate that if every company in Europe were to hire just one young person, the problem of youth unemployment would effectively go away. He is right to a certain extent. I am not trying to say that we should insist that money from the European Union will only be made available when companies take on one or two young people. That sort of approach reminds me of my past in the German Democratic Republic, which was also unable to resolve this sort of problem. However, I think it is worth considering how we can establish an intelligent project that could be subsidised by the European Union and would give young people real opportunities for training followed by jobs within companies. Perhaps we will be able to make progress in this area in time for the next subsidy period. However, I must make it clear that I do not want to see merely windfall effects for companies. There must be lasting growth and a lasting reduction in unemployment. I do have one request for the Commission. I know that the Commission is currently reviewing competition law. It would be very helpful in this respect if we could ensure that regions are not pulled apart and that the subsidy conditions in one region are not completely different from those in another. This would lead to more bureaucracy and make access to subsidy funding much more difficult. I hope that the Commission can come up with a positive proposal in this area which will not result in the regions being torn apart. Constanze Angela Krehl  (S&amp;D

Targeted investment in business, infrastructure and renewable energies will be required in Greece in order to get the country back on its feet. This is precisely the purpose of the funds provided for under European cohesion policy. In order to implement our projects, however, we need money from private investors. These are unable to raise the necessary loans at present, however, because the banks mostly view any investment in Greece as too risky. That is why I believe we should use part of the funds already allocated to Greece to secure such loans. The banks can rest assured that they will get their money back, while investors will get their much-needed loans and can therefore participate in EU projects, enabling Greece to create several thousand jobs. The advantage of the report is also that it enables very efficient use of the precious funding that is available: by simply using these resources to secure the risk, we can generate more investment than if the money were to be invested directly in projects. Finally, this report makes one thing clear: the European Union is right behind Greece and private investors can rely on this fact. Constanze Angela Krehl,

Madam President, Commissioner, I would like to make three brief points in response to this oral question. First of all, I very much welcome the fact that the Commission wants to put tackling youth unemployment at the heart of its policy. Giving hope and a future to young people is part of our remit and it is very important to us. Secondly, I also welcome the fact that the Commission is increasingly realising that, in a time of economic crisis more than ever, cuts are not the only route to success: we also need investment. In that respect, SMEs should, of course, be our topmost priority, because they create the most jobs and are very important for economic development. Thirdly, let me be very clear and open about this: it appears, from what is being said in the media, that Mr Barroso has been giving the impression that he is able to stump up EUR 82 billion for this European Union, with the throwaway comment afterwards that that money will no longer be spent as planned in the cohesion policy, anyway; we will, instead, be able to use that money right away to do precisely what we have just been talking about: namely, tackling youth unemployment and supporting SMEs. EUR 82 billion – that is almost a quarter of the total cohesion policy budget up to 2013. As far as I am aware, that money is already tied up in programmes and projects. How exactly do you intend to go about this: that is, allowing all the regions, all of a sudden, to start doing something completely different with that money and, then, because the youth unemployment figures are not so high in your neck of the woods, making some of that money available to other countries? The regions have responded to this with dismay. I have received a lot of calls from people asking me: what is going on? Is the money being taken away from us? What is the point of that? Let me give you a word of warning. The cohesion policy has really been a tremendously successful policy and one that has been extremely tangible and comprehensible to citizens. It creates trust. If we now start making vague statements like this, which create the impression that we have money left over, that our policy so far has not been adequate, or that we can rustle up a couple of billion just like that, that will not create any additional trust, but only uncertainty. Most importantly, when I consider the fact that the Council has failed to provide the full amount of funds considered necessary by the Commission and Parliament for this year’s budget negotiations and the fact that, according to the information I have received, some EUR 15 billion are needed this year for projects that have already been completed, but we only have EUR 5 billion, at the very most, at our disposal, then I really wonder how anyone can go around implying that Member States are prepared to fork out more money and allocate additional funds for the cohesion policy. I think that we need to be careful that we actually pursue the right policy and that we offer support to countries with high youth unemployment. However, I would also like us to ensure that we do not create even more uncertainty for people in times that are difficult enough already. Constanze Angela Krehl  (S&amp;D

 Mr President, there is broad agreement both in Parliament and in the Commission on the future importance of cohesion policy for all the regions in Europe. I would like to ask Mr Hahn how the Commission intends to ensure that genuine flexibility within the regions can be guaranteed, given the differences between the regions and their different levels of growth, if everything is being controlled with great precision under the terms of the regulations and there is hardly any scope to accommodate the specific features of each region.

 Does this mean that a region which has already introduced extensive energy efficiency measures will not be forced to do so, but could instead invest in research facilities and that this could be laid down in the partnership contract? Constanze Angela Krehl,  
on behalf of the S&amp;D Group
. – (DE) 
Madam President, cohesion policy is a successful European policy which everyone makes use of, including regions which are not as well developed and those which already have a strong economy. A variety of studies have demonstrated this. However, most importantly, the citizens of Europe can experience its benefits at first hand. This is why we need cohesion policy in future in all the regions of the European Union. Nevertheless, we are under an obligation to make our good policies even better. This is what the European Parliament is aiming to achieve with Mr Pieper’s report. Modern cohesion policy means facing the new challenges, creating up-to-date infrastructure, combating climate change, supporting energy security and efficiency, promoting research and development, providing support for small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs) and creating jobs. Of course, we also need to ensure that the funding is used efficiently. Therefore, we are making it clear that cohesion policy must be more transparent and results-oriented and must involve less red tape. The coordination between the various funds and programmes must also be improved, as Mr Stavrakakis said earlier. One very important point is that the partnership principle must be taken to a new and better level. We must involve everyone, including the regions, local areas, both sides of industry and major non-governmental organisations. The new intermediate category remains controversial. We are of the opinion that the intermediate category will help regions which need more support than the classic Objective 2 regions. They will not be funded at the expense of other regions. On the contrary, the result will not be a patchwork of subsidies. Instead the many phasing-in and phasing-out procedures will be standardised and I believe that this is something which we really need in the European Union. Anyone who thinks that we are introducing a permanent subsidy category is underestimating the European Parliament. Over the past few years we have demonstrated often enough that we are able to bring in community initiatives when they are needed. However, we have also worked jointly to remove them again once the objective has been achieved. We are competent enough to be able to judge at the end of a subsidy period whether the results are good and how we should redesign the programme. Therefore, I am calling on my fellow Members to support this new intermediate category when it comes to the vote. Constanze Angela Krehl,  
rapporteur for the opinion of the Committee on Regional Development.
 – (DE)
 Mr President, cohesion policy accounts for one of the largest individual budgets in the European Union. We need to develop a new policy that is adapted to the new challenges. We want investment in a modern infrastructure, in research, innovation and the development of new technologies. We want sustainable, integrated urban development and we want a well-educated workforce. The regions need specific subsidies to help them to become competitive and to develop economically. However, at the same time, it must be said that all regions must have access to cohesion policy, both Eastern European Member States and strong national economies like Germany. Eastern Germany requires support. However, some western German regions require European aid, as do parts of the United Kingdom. This requires a budget that should be no smaller than the current one and that cannot be split into different sectors. We must make every effort to improve efficiency and transparency and we must link this with an abandonment of unnecessary bureaucracy. Cohesion is linked with solidarity. However, cohesion is also sensible from an economic point of view and necessary. A lack of cohesion is bad news, even for strong national economies. For this reason, we should provide appropriate financial backing for cohesion policy. I would like to thank the rapporteur for including the opinion of the Committee on Regional Development in his report and I would ask for support for the amendment for once again improving the intermediate categories. We have reached a compromise in the Committee on Regional Development and I would recommend that this House should incorporate the compromise found by the specialist politicians in the Garriga Report. I would ask for your broad support. Constanze Angela Krehl,

 Mr President, Commissioners, ladies and gentlemen, in the European Union, cohesion policy means that we aim to lend our support to the weaker regions. It is an expression of major European solidarity. Solidarity, however, is never a one-way street, and my group therefore backs the principle that all the regions of the European Union must be able to participate in our cohesion policy. For us, this also means that we will not support any measures of renationalisation and that we do not want to see cohesion policy fragmented into sector-based policy approaches. We do not need any extra transport or climate protection or energy efficiency funds, but we do need to work on how we reconcile the challenges we face with a sound cohesion policy. It is therefore clear to us that, alongside a strong Objective 1 area, we also need a strong Objective 2 area, and appropriate transitional rules. One thing is for certain, and that is that regions need our support at the European level. The European Union needs strong regions, too, and there is therefore a give and take in both directions. Of course, we need to review our priorities – clearly, we do need greater efficiency. My group is therefore four-square behind the proposal, in order, for example, to be able to coordinate rural development much better together under the umbrella of cohesion policy than in the past. Of course, we also back improving infrastructure, supporting businesses and supporting sustainable economic development. However, sustainable economic development is only possible if we bring the employed – the people – with us. In other words, we need employment policy approaches, we need education, we need training, we need people to integrate into the labour market. That, in turn, is only possible in collaboration with the European Social Fund, under the umbrella of cohesion policy. We support this, but with dedicated rules, which there did used to be in the past. We need to really make an effort to improve this and significantly strengthen the social side of cohesion policy. In the forthcoming discussions and negotiations, my group will be going in to bat for improving and simplifying the usability of the fund. We need a simplification of the application processes so that, first of all, fewer errors are made, and, secondly, so that access for those people who really want to work can be made easier through this European cohesion policy. We will strive to ensure that, in these negotiations, a stronger partnership principle really is implemented. I believe that Parliament’s role has been strengthened now that the Treaty of Lisbon is in force. My group will be arguing the case for this partnership principle. Constanze Angela Krehl  (S&amp;D

– (DE)
 Mr President, the current Cohesion policy started life with the title of the Lisbon Strategy. However, I firmly believe that the Cohesion policy can, and will, make an enormous contribution to the Europe 2020 strategy, not just because we command a considerable budget in comparison with other European policies but, above all, because the Cohesion policy allows us to have sustainable development in our regions and ensures good monitoring of the restructuring processes and challenges in our regions. However, there is one core issue here that I would like to clarify once again, and that goes for our group as well: our Cohesion policy can only work if economic development is considered to be equally as important as social development and providing training for workers. In principle, we need to take joint responsibility for the funds that are available to us. It is a bit like hardware and software – one cannot work without the other. Constanze Angela Krehl,  
deputising for the rapporteur.

 Mr President, I am very sorry that Mr Kirilov cannot present the report himself. He has worked very hard to draw up a report for Parliament on a subject which is very important for the regions and the citizens of the European Union. Therefore, I would like to read out his notes. They are in English, which is very surprising for a Bulgarian Member. However, it is a good thing that I do not have to speak Bulgarian. I am very pleased that I can represent him here in Parliament, even though he was unable to get a flight in Sofia.  Mr President, I am glad that this evening we have the opportunity to discuss important amendments to the Structural Funds general regulation. These modifications are a substantial element of the common efforts at European and national level to overcome the consequences of the economic crisis. They are a logical continuation of the documents which we adopted last year. Then, as the rapporteur on the role of the cohesion policy for investment in the real economy, I called on the Council and Commission to work for simplification of the Structural Funds rules and thus facilitating access to these funds when they are more needed by the Member States. I am happy that Parliament’s main recommendations for further simplification have been taken on board. I am convinced that the new changes to the general regulations, simplifying some of the existing procedures, deserve our support. Reducing unnecessary administrative burden, red tape and unclear rules will contribute to more transparency, better control and fewer irregularities. This also means improved implementation and correct spending on EU money. Here is just one example. Through the amendment of Article 88, the Member States are further stimulated to detect and correct irregularities before they are found by the EU controlling institutions. In this case, the Member States will not lose the affected money but will be able to use them again for other projects within the relevant programme. The second group of amendments concern financial management rules. Advance payments for countries worst hit by the crisis will be increased for 2010. All Member States will receive more time to spend 2007-committed funds for projects which have not been approved or implemented within the deadlines. Both groups of measures are important because of their message to the beneficiaries and because of their practical utility. Anti-crisis measures are a clear demonstration of solidarity. They will bring fresh money for the Member States to get out of the crisis. All measures will commit realisation of more projects, especially now. This is crucial for the creation of jobs, investment and infrastructure and adaptation of workers and firms to the economic change. Both types of measures are useful and more valuable if they are implemented at the right time, but they are still awaiting final approval. Unfortunately, there was a huge delay in the Council for reaching an agreement when it was the leading body for the adoption of the amended regulation. I strongly believe that now, when Parliament has the same power as the Council, we will not postpone any more the approval and entry into force of these long-awaited and needed measures.

 Mr President, this is certainly not a nice reason for this debate. Madeira has been hit by an unbelievable natural disaster and we extend our condolences to the families affected. The European Union must provide support in this situation. The solidarity of the whole of the European Union is required here and I can only reiterate what has already been said. I urge the Commission to mobilise the Solidarity Fund as quickly as possible so that help can be provided. I would like to ask the Council to ensure that the reform of the Solidarity Fund that Parliament adopted two years ago is finally implemented, because this will make it possible to provide assistance more quickly to the regions affected. We also need to look to the future. In recent years, Madeira has received a lot of structural fund resources and will also continue to do so over the next few years. These resources need to be used to take preventative action so as to be able to reduce the terrible consequences of natural disasters and therefore also the suffering. This is something that, as the European Union, we need to implement in the regions and therefore also in Madeira. Constanze Angela Krehl,

Madam President, the Group of the Progressive Alliance of Socialists and Democrats in the European Parliament supports the initiative for the development of a strategy for the Danube Region. This is an important project to us, also because it strengthens, in an exemplary manner, territorial cohesion, which has been included for the first time in the Treaty of Lisbon, and may also provide an opportunity to make it clear exactly what we understand by territorial cohesion. I hope that Mr Rehn has also told the many partners he has spoken to that the European Parliament will be duly involved in drawing up the common strategy for the Danube Region. Unfortunately, I did not hear the words European Parliament in your speech, but we will duly take part in the debate. I am pleased that we are having the first major debate here in plenary today. In addition to territorial cohesion, it is also important to make it clear that this strategy involves cross-border cooperation, something that we are always encouraging and have always supported in the area of cohesion policy, and in fact already wanted to increase during this funding period. I hope that this will have even greater success in the next few years, including in connection with the Danube Strategy. I would like to point out that, with this Danube Strategy, we will attain European added value, which will be really tangible, particularly for the people living in this region. They should, therefore, be directly involved in drawing up the strategy and they should also be given the opportunity to witness this European project. My earnest request is that we do not overload and burden the strategy with too many priorities, but that we focus on what we want to achieve. In my opinion, it is very important that we use the existing resources more efficiently and that we build or expand warning systems, for example, and set them up appropriately to warn of natural disasters such as floods, but also to respond in the event of industrial accidents, for example, which result in the pollution of the Danube and neighbouring regions. Common areas of activity exist here. A successful Danube Strategy and successful projects in this region may also provide models for other regions. Without always having to immediately invent a new strategy, we can use this as an example for resolving problems together in cross-border European cooperation and – if we succeed in actually incorporating third countries into such a strategy – also for putting in place a Neighbourhood Policy, which is something that is important for all of us in the European Union and which should be promoted.

 Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, I would have liked to see a more exciting introduction to this topic, because I believe that the European cohesion policy must change after 2013. We are faced with quite different challenges than was the case 10 or 15 years ago. The focus for my group is on the fact that solidarity between the regions is not negotiable. On the one hand, this means that all the regions must have the opportunity to participate in the European Union cohesion policy and, on the other hand, it also means that we must oppose any attempt to renationalise the cohesion policy. We need a European approach which allows citizens to identify with the European Union. For us, there is no question that we also need to change. In the next few years, the spotlight will be on a discussion about prioritising the areas which will receive funding from the European cohesion policy. In future, we will not be able to subsidise everyone with European money. We must focus on establishing effective infrastructures, in particular, in the new Member States, and on developing research and innovation. Of course, we must also bear in mind that in future, the European cohesion policy will have to respond appropriately to challenges such as climate change, demographic change and globalisation. We also need to concentrate on urban development. This is not because I want to neglect rural areas, but because we know that 80% of citizens live in towns, cities and urban hinterlands and because rural development unfortunately does not form part of the cohesion policy at the moment, but is covered by agriculture policy. Our approach is to create stronger networks. I do not yet know whether this will work, but we must rise to the challenge. Importantly, support for people themselves also forms part of the cohesion policy and this is why I regret the fact that the Commissioner’s response was slightly evasive. For us, this means primarily education, training and qualifications for everyone from small children right through to the elderly. Life-long learning is an important concept. However, this also means that the European Social Fund (ESF) must continue to be integrated with the cohesion policy. There must be no thoughts of separating the ESF from the cohesion policy. Cross-border cooperation is very important to us. We want to strengthen this cooperation at the same time as simplifying the bureaucracy involved. Constanze Angela Krehl,  
on behalf of the S&amp;D Group.

Mr President, Mrs Malmström, ladies and gentlemen, I am delighted that the Swedish Presidency has put cooperation in the Baltic Sea area at the top of its agenda. There is no need for argument here: we need to protect resources and we, too, need to help protect the climate and nature. On the other hand, we must also focus cooperation in the Baltic Sea area on economic development, of that there can be no question. You have our full support here. However, some questions do still arise. You just said that there are no additional funds. As we discussed this in committee, all the funds are to be made available under the current cohesion policy. For me, this raises the question of whether this means under existing projects that are already being financed from cohesion resources or under new projects. If so, we need to ask which cohesion policy projects already approved will lose funding. This is a very important point, because I already know that the towns, local authorities and regions will come and ask me, what should we do in order to become involved in the Baltic Sea Strategy? How do we get the funds to run this sort of project? If we do not give them a good answer and cannot indicate how this cooperation is to be organised, then citizens’ enthusiasm for Baltic Sea cooperation will probably quickly turn to frustration. That is not the objective that we are working together to achieve and we therefore need to hold very intensive talks on how to organise this cooperation. I therefore ask – and I would ask the Commissioner to take this on board – that not only the Council and the Commission participate in the Baltic Sea Strategy, but also that Parliament is properly involved in this cooperation and in the implementation of this strategy, because we would like other regions to profit as well, as with the Black Sea policy or with cooperation between the states bordering the Danube. That would be very important to us. Dagmar Roth-Behrendt,  
rapporteur for the opinion of the Committee on Legal Affairs.

Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, where the Council and the Member States are concerned, I often have the feeling, well, I am often reminded of a monitor lizard. Monitor lizards have forked tongues. Perhaps that is too complex a metaphor for the Member States, so let me simply say that they have a split personality. They want to impose more and more new tasks on the European Union – and to some extent we support that with our priorities – but they are not willing to equip the EU with the capacities it needs, in terms of adequate personnel, to perform these tasks. I have heard our fellow Members talking about the different policy areas, such as agriculture, as Mr De Castro has mentioned, but also cultural policy, research, environmental policy, social policy and regional development. These are tremendously important areas for all of the Member States and for the regions which we represent. What strikes me, however, is what the Member States are not doing. They are not considering who is meant to do the work on all of these policies. Who is supposed to process the applications? Who will ensure that the projects are implemented properly and funding is channelled to where it is needed? For that to happen, we need enough staff, and these staff must be properly qualified, highly skilled employees. We need the very best people we can find! We need a multicultural workforce from many different European Union countries, with more geographical balance and outstanding language skills. What does the Council want? What do the Member States want? They want to make cuts here! Unless we have an appropriate financial framework for administrative expenditure, we will not be in a position to work on any policy areas at all. With that in mind, I urge you, President-in-Office, to ensure that the Commission’s proposal on the staff regulations is accepted so that we have an appropriate framework that enables us to carry out this work!

 Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, if we had been this timid during the BSE crisis fifteen years ago, when I was the chair of a committee, we would not have safe beef on which we can now rely. Fifteen years ago, it was self-evident that we would introduce an animal passport and that two ear tags would be mandatory. Today, we are once again hesitant. Do we really need crises in order to make the right decisions? The rapporteur said that this is not about public health, but that is precisely what this is about. This is about health policy, it is about public health. I admit that the introduction of a mandatory electronic identification system does, of course, involve a certain amount of expenditure and effort. I therefore proposed in committee that we should put forward a transitional period of 10 years. Even that, however, was too much for the majority of the committee. Do you want to face your electors earnestly and tell them that you take public health seriously? Not a single farmer would say that they could not achieve this given ten years. Let us turn now to voluntary labelling. In this connection, we have repeatedly said that what we want to do is to urge farmers to connect better with consumers and provide information in which consumers are interested. How old are the animals? How have they lived? How have they been fed? How were they reared? We are providing this option with the voluntary system. It is used in every Member State. The rapporteur is now proposing that we should remove the essential characteristics that provide conditions for how the system is to be operated. That would mean that there would be a system, but no conditions within it. Who seriously believes that something like that can actually work? Not a single national authority would be able to monitor these elements. No one can manage that. In other words, the aim is to destroy an existing system. Fortunately, the majority of the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Food Safety – and the rapporteur must represent that committee here, after all – decided to retain this voluntary system as it is. I would like to ask all my fellow Members to vote in favour of the amendments tabled by that committee when we vote on this tomorrow. Ladies and gentlemen, I do believe, however, that we could consider whether we can simplify this system from an administrative point of view. Then, however, we would have to simplify the system and remove the administrative obstacles and hurdles. We need to help the authorities, but the way proposed here is the wrong way to go. Ladies and gentlemen, I ask you urgently, including in the interests of the consumers and of the farmers of the European Union, to follow the lead of the decisions of the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Food Safety when it comes to voluntary labelling.

– Madam President, yes it is true that we need more money in the European budget to have programmes to educate about HIV/AIDS and to monitor it. But I wish to ask Ms Parvanova if she agrees with me that Member States are neglecting that disease and that we have different amounts of money spent in Member States – which is a shame, as we heard from Ms Childers – and that it would be necessary to ask the Commission to ask the Member States to show us how much money they spend on education programmes, how much money they spend on treating the disease, on hospices and on helping to eradicate this disease? It would be good if we could ask the new Presidency, the Danish Presidency, to deliver those numbers as soon as possible. Dagmar Roth-Behrendt  (S&amp;D

Madam President, Commissioner, medicinal products are one of the most important things that help people to get healthy, but, at the same time, they pose an enormous risk. Do you agree with me that our approach needs to be more harmonised? Do you agree with me that the ‘notified bodies’ in the Member States do not work well? Do you agree with me that the new legislation that you are going to bring forward over the next year must therefore ensure, on behalf of patients, that there is a body that checks in a uniform and harmonised way whether a medicinal product really is safe for patients? Do you further agree with me that it is necessary, for the wellbeing of patients in the European Union, for us to clearly define the use of any given product – whether on a one-off or repeated basis – and not to leave this in the hands of the industry.

 Mr President, I would have liked my fellow Members to have been slightly braver and to have gone for a second reading and then the conciliation procedure, whatever the Presidency in question. No front-of-pack labelling, no calorie information on the front, no indication at least of the calories in alcohol, never mind any other ingredients, no portion sizes at all, not a spoonful or a cup or anything else. The compromise includes none of these things. The country of origin information, which is something that consumers urgently need to know, is totally inadequate. The content of Article 25, like everything else, is linked to reports from the Commission on the status of the implementation of provisions: reports on trans fats, reports on products with one ingredient, reports on a whole range of other subjects. This really is a resounding failure. It is not a good result and it is very disheartening. I would have liked to have seen a proper second reading and then, if necessary, the conciliation procedure. That would have been a respectable result. Now European consumers will simply be disappointed. Dagmar Roth-Behrendt,

 Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I can no longer count the number of times over the past 14 or 15 years that I have spoken here in Parliament on subjects relating to bovine spongiform encephalopathy (BSE), transmissible spongiform encephalopathies (TSEs), animal health and, most importantly, consumer protection and human health. In 1997 I was the chair of the BSE committee and since then I have had the opportunity to speak perhaps 20, 30 or 40 times on the subject. We have a report here to discuss today and to vote on tomorrow, which concerns another Commission road map. At this point, I would like to thank the Commission, Mr Dalli and his colleagues once again for their cooperation. Over all the years that we have been dealing with BSE, this cooperation has been of a consistently high quality and I am grateful for this. However, this has not always been the case. If the situation in the 1980s and 1990s had been similar, we would have perhaps had fewer problems, but, thank goodness, things have changed over recent years. The road map contains essential technical sections, but it also has sections relating to the content which are important in political terms. I would like to refer to some of them, but I will not be able to cover all of them because of a lack of time. In all of the proposals which I am asking you to accept tomorrow, safeguarding the health of consumers is, of course, the highest priority. In recent years, we have introduced several amendments to the legislation on BSE and TSEs and, rightly so, when you consider that in 2001 we had 2 167 cases of animals with BSE in the European Union, while in 2009 the figure was only 67. This alone shows what a quantum leap forward has been taken in animal health and also in consumer protection. Tomorrow we will have to look at the question of whether we want to continue on this path. I have made a few proposals relating to the content which will also help us to continue reducing the risk of BSE and TSEs. However, I would like to focus here on one proposal and that is the question of the ban on feeding meat and bone meal to omnivores which are not ruminants, in other words, not sheep, goats and cattle. In 2001, in the light of the BSE crisis and the BSE scandal, a ban on feeding meat and bone meal to pigs and poultry in particular was introduced. At no point did this have any scientific basis; it was purely a political decision. At that time we had to admit that contaminated meat and bone meal had been fed to cattle. This was highly unethical because cattle are ruminants and herbivores and should not eat meat and bone meal. This contributed to the BSE crisis and, therefore, there was a complete ban on feeding meat and bone meal which also covered omnivores, in other words, animals which eat animal protein and, in particular, pigs and poultry. I would like to propose to you now, just as the Commission is doing, that we go back and say that if we can produce these products safely, then we must also be able to feed them. There is no point in us eating only about one third of an animal and not eating the rest of the animal which is fit for human consumption, but also not being allowed to reuse it to feed other animals. Therefore, we must amend this regulation. We are importing large quantities of protein crops, soya in particular, from the USA and Brazil, all of which have been genetically modified. That is not an acceptable alternative. We need our own high-quality, safe supply from within the European Union. The manufacturing method used must meet the relevant standards and we must also ensure that no cannibalism occurs. In other words, pigs must only eat meat and bone meal made from poultry and vice versa. The Commission can make sure that this is what happens. I hope that tomorrow, following the very positive cooperation, a large majority will be in favour of taking this next step towards returning the situation to normal. Dagmar Roth-Behrendt,  
rapporteur.

 Madam President, in conclusion I would like to look at one point and that is the question of the feed ban which was introduced in 2001. I understand the fact that not all of you have been as closely involved with this subject over the last 15 years as I have. However, it is important for you to know that bovine spongiform encephalopathy (BSE) came about because illegal, undeclared feed containing processed ruminant protein was wrongly fed to cattle. In other words, sheep suffering from scrapie made their way into the meat and bone meal and this infected a similar species, namely another ruminant. This report, which I am sure you have all read, and this is directed at Mrs Grossetête, Mrs Rivasi and also Mrs Werthmann, specifically does not state that it will be possible to process ruminants to produce meat and bone meal. Ruminants are specifically excluded. Only pigs and poultry will be processed to make meat and bone meal. Even if the wicked farmers whom Mrs Rivasi mentioned actually exist and even if these nasty farmers do something illegal, in other words, feeding pig meat and bone meal to cattle, nothing would happen to the cattle. Therefore, and you can really believe me, because I will not do anything in relation to BSE and transmissible spongiform encephalopathies (TSEs) without thinking about it in great detail, I am calling on you once again to consider this carefully. Mr Häusling, Mrs Rivasi’s fellow Member, drafted an excellent report on the protein deficit in the European Union. We must not throw away other parts of animals that we eat because we cannot or do not want to process these parts which are fit for human consumption. This is what we did until 2001. The correct reaction at that time would have been to continue using meat and bone meal, but not to process cattle and sheep to produce it. That would have been the sensible solution. However, we rather overshot the mark and took our populist approach a little too far. Now it is time to correct this mistake. In the meantime, 10 years have passed and it is clear that meat and bone meal is a valuable source of protein, just as valuable as soya from Brazil and the USA and perhaps a better solution than creating monocultures in those countries and importing genetically modified plants into the European Union. I am calling on Parliament to take a unified stand tomorrow. I would ask you all to support my proposal. Dagmar Roth-Behrendt  (S&amp;D

 Mr President, Mr Dalli, your colleagues in the Directorate-General for Health and Consumers and yourself have done everything right. The same cannot be said of the German authorities. The least that we can say is that there is chaos when it comes to communications, and that, perhaps, is putting it mildly. The fact that Germany’s health minister yesterday thought it unnecessary to travel to a Health Council in Luxembourg where the main topic on the agenda was this serious infection crisis shows that he has absolutely no idea what Europe is really about and that he is ignorant, does not recognise the problems, or is still busy with internal party political crises. (Applause)
 What is more, I must observe – and Mr Dalli said it himself – that the German authorities clearly took the view that they would do without European Union experts, patronisingly and arrogantly believing that they had no need for them. Furthermore, the fact that it took three days for these experts to get into Germany is a scandal, and one that we must be critical of in this House. At the same time, however, we also have to say that it is our job, in the European Union, to warn consumers when there is a dangerous foodstuff on the market. I say to you quite clearly – if there are dangerous bacteria on a cucumber or a lettuce that do not lead to death, that may be a good thing, but for me it is not enough to justify a compensation case. Cucumbers from Spain and other countries did have EHEC bacteria on them. They were not the bacteria behind this outbreak, but it takes a while to find that out. For me, that is not the point, either. Those of you who understand the European Union and know the early warning system also know how the early warning system works. You know that, in the early warning system, the product and also the name of the producer must be named. You can also look that up easily in the legislation. For me, the important question is what will happen in future? In the future, we need to consider whether slurry use can continue. Could there still be production methods that are unacceptable? Who, in the European Union, actually monitors what, when and with what result this is documented, and who has what obligations in that regard? (Applause) President. − 
 Thank you very much. To those Members who wish to avail of the ‘catch-the-eye’ procedure, I would say that we already have approximately 20 speeches and that I do not believe we shall have enough time before the vote. However, you are still welcome to try. President.  
– The joint debate is closed. The vote on the two reports will take place at midday today, 8 March. This will be followed by celebrations to mark the 100th anniversary of International Women’s Day. All the women in the Chamber, in Parliament, in the Commission and in the Council are cordially requested to attend a joint photo call after the ceremony. I hope that this announcement will be heard by all the ladies and gentlemen in their offices and that they will attend the plenary directly. Written statements (Rule 149) Dagmar Roth-Behrendt,

 Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, we can all imagine the nightmare. Someone we know is ill and in a desperate situation. They are given medicines, but the medicines have no effect, because they have been falsified. We are grateful to the Commission for producing this proposal. It is true that we have been discussing it for some time. We began our debates in the previous parliamentary term and I would like to thank Mr Adamou, who is no longer a Member of this Parliament, for the preliminary work that he did on behalf of Mrs Matias. I believe that we have reached a good compromise, as Mrs Grossetête has said. Yes, we could have gone further. We are all impatient and we all want greater safety, but this is a good compromise. What have we achieved? We have made patient safety the central feature of the legislation. The safety measures that we have put in place will ensure that products are traceable throughout the entire distribution chain. Medicines can be traced from the manufacturer to the pharmacist. They will have an identifier which makes it immediately obvious if they are falsified or duplicated or if there are any irregularities, which can then be followed up. We have deliberately done this in such a way that the costs of the system remain at a reasonable level for everyone involved and that the system is not excessive. However, we are also not compromising on patient safety. This traceability is accompanied by the fact that the packaging must be undamaged, so that a patient who is given a pack can see that it has not been opened because it has an intact seal. In addition, there will be no more packs of medicines which are divided in two, as frequently used to be the case. All of this will improve safety levels and increase patients’ confidence. What else have we achieved? We have implemented an early warning system. This is excellent because it is the same system which has been in place for decades for foods and which we take for granted. There is an early warning system throughout the European Union for contaminated food. It is hard to believe that we have not had the same thing for medicines. If a falsified medicine is discovered, it is now possible to send out an early warning. The Member States must identify the patients who are affected, inform everyone involved and make sure that the risk involved in a medicine which is in circulation is made public. We take this for granted in the case of cars and food, but it has not been available so far for something as essential as medicines. As far as the Internet is concerned, anyone who accesses an illegal website must be able to recognise that it is illegal. This is why we must certify legal websites which, in future, will have a link to the website of the national approval body. They will be able to display a logo which will be developed by the European Commission. Everyone who buys medicines on the Internet can do so independently. They can tell whether they are dealing with a safe, legal website or an illegal one. All of this is a milestone, a quantum leap forward in patient safety. If we adopt this legislation tomorrow, we can be proud of what we have done and we should also make our achievements clear to the general public. President. −

 Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, this legislation is actually superfluous. I hope that it will continue to be superfluous because patients will not need to make use of it. In an ideal world, patients would receive the best healthcare most quickly in the country of their birth or the country where they live. The fact that we are discussing this today and adopting the legislation tomorrow is, as Mr Liese has rightly said, indicative of a cynical approach among the Member States. It means that the Member States have not recognised what they owe to their citizens, in other words, rapid, effective and high quality healthcare. It also shows that they would rather invest in other things than in these areas which provide services for their citizens and that is a disgrace. In addition, the negotiations in the Council on this subject are not something to be proud of. However, if this legislation is actually applied at some point, because patients need it, and that is not a good thing, I will be very pleased about what we have achieved. I am grateful to the rapporteur, Mrs Grossetête, and to my fellow Members for their cooperation. We have achieved a great deal. We have succeeded finally in putting the focus on rare diseases. People with these illnesses have always been sidelined and have found it difficult to obtain any treatment at all. We have at last managed to establish information points in the Member States which will inform people about their rights. There has been nothing of this kind available in the past. If reference networks are set up in future, it will finally be possible for the Member States to share best practices, information about gold and platinum standards and scientific progress. This has not been coordinated until now. There are some individual beacons of excellence, but no coordination. All of these things represent major successes, together with outpatient care and other areas which I will not go into now. Of course, there are also things that make me feel sad. I would have preferred not to have had the fuss and squabbling about prior authorisation, which simply shows that the Member States have not recognised the things that are really important. Fortunately, however, there are some Member States with which we can work well and we have demonstrated that today. Our objective must be to ensure that the healthcare system in every country is so good that no one wants to travel to another country whose language they do not speak. If what we are doing today and tomorrow is a small step towards this, because it will become clearer which countries have good services and which have poor services, which are doing something for their citizens and which are not, then we will have achieved a great deal. I hope that one of the minor side-effects of this will be transparency. We need to know which Member States have high standards and which are at a low level. I come from a country where I can feel relatively relaxed. However, I am aware of the problems of people in many other Member States and I feel ashamed about this, because it is not worthy of the European Union. I would like to thank the rapporteur for her hard work and, in particular, the Commission, Mr Dalli and his team, who have given the European Parliament and the father of this legislation in the previous parliamentary term, Mr Bowis, as much support as we could have wished for. I would also like to thank particularly the Belgian Presidency, which is not present today, but which has done everything possible to ensure that this process was successful. Although the Belgian Presidency did everything in its power, it could not always achieve a great deal, because of the sometimes stubborn, antediluvian attitudes of other Member States. However, something has been done and I believe that we will be able to vote in favour of this legislation tomorrow with a clear conscience. (Applause) President. − 
 Colleagues, just to let the speaker and everybody know what is happening, we now have three more people who want to ask a blue-card question. As this possibility has been introduced by the working group on parliamentary reform, I am very sympathetic to that and we have enough time, but nevertheless I have to ask the speaker if he will take all those questions. Then I would ask everybody whether we can take the questions in turn and then ask Mr Hökmark to answer. We will then finalise that part of the speaking time. President. − 
 Mr Swoboda, I fully support what you have said. It is very rude and lacking in respect. Mr De Rossa, a point of order? President.

 Mr President, let us approach this whole process rather more calmly. Usually, the Vice-Presidents of Parliament are elected in a block at the start of the legislative period or in the course of the legislative period. When we do that, fellow Members, we only ever find out the number of ‘Yes’ votes cast for a candidate – which also decides the order in which Members are elected to the Bureau. Now, because a Member has left, we are voting in one more Vice-President today – so the only important thing is whether he has received the number of ‘Yes’ votes required for election. Anything else makes no difference. It is different to other votes. (Applause)
 The President of Parliament has given a perfect description of the secret ballot, and it worked beautifully for me without my having to press various buttons. I pressed the button that I wanted to press and the blue light appeared. Perhaps we could simply all try it together once more, Mr President. (Applause) President.

Unfortunately, the Commissioner in question was not able to be with us on time, which I find regrettable, as there is no ash cloud at the moment and as it is already 11.00. Maybe at some point, the Commission could discuss the fact that the competent Commissioners should be here. That, too, is a subject for the framework agreement.

 Mr President, Mr Barroso, our circumstances are different and we have a different institutional structure. Now that the Treaty of Lisbon is in place, the three institutions – Parliament, the Council and the European Commission – will have to work together in a different way to how they have done up to now. I believe that we all need to be interested in making this a success. Your involvement in the first part of the interinstitutional agreement gives me the impression – and I am not always uncritical of you – that you want this, too. The first part of this agreement that we have negotiated with you contains important elements for the role of the European Parliament in our cooperation with you, in particular, but also with the Council. These elements are the strengthening of the dialogue between Parliament and the European Commission, the possibility of receiving more information than we have done in the past, in other words, to be able to be an equal partner in the legislative process, and a genuine question time in which commissioners, who are, ultimately, politicians, come here and answer questions and give speeches and responses, without hiding away as they have done in the past. Previously, only you, Mr Barroso, had the courage to do that. Now, all of them will do so. That is a good thing. It will benefit all of us, and it will also be beneficial for European democracy and, hopefully, also for the interest of citizens in what we do, namely our legislative work for everyone. Finally, Mr Barroso, with regard to the question of legislative initiative, I firmly believe that, with what we were able to achieve in the negotiations with you regarding our cooperation and what we have today shaped into a resolution, we have come as close to the right of initiative for the European Parliament as we possibly can. It furthermore rules out the sui generis
 construct. You worked with us on this and you worked earnestly on it. I respect that and very much appreciate how you have contributed to this. The impact assessments have already been mentioned by other Members. You have undertaken to make this transparent and to act in a cooperative manner. You said that social impact assessments are important to you. That is an essential point from our perspective. I am completely happy with this. I believe that we should begin the work today, and not before time. President.  
– I would remind the Members once again that the Blue Card system created by the Working Party on Parliamentary Reform does not apply to the Commission and the Council, but only to debates amongst Members of this House. A motion for a resolution to close this debate has been tabled by the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Food Safety(1)
. The debate is now closed. The vote will take place tomorrow. President.  
– Thank you very much, Mrs Gräßle. As you are addressing the Commission directly, I would encourage the Commissioner to listen closely to what you have to say. That makes it much easier to answer afterwards. President.  
– Thank you very much, Commissioner Šemeta. There were a few more questions from the Members, but it is my understanding that you do not want to answer Mr Garriga and the other Members directly. Perhaps you would like to get your answers to the Members in question in writing. They would certainly appreciate that enormously.

 Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, to take Ms Schaldemose’s example, if we imagine that we had a USB stick and every computer had a different access port, we would all have to buy different adaptors. This example alone shows how important standardisation is and the great extent to which it can make life easier for citizens. This is a very important issue that we have to debate here. We, in Parliament, have also succeeded in adding many improvements to the Commission’s text. I would therefore like to offer my sincere thanks to the rapporteur and to our shadow rapporteur for their outstanding work. There were, however, two points – to single out just a couple of topics, for time reasons – that were particularly close to our hearts. First of all, we had the support for small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs) – which was a very important point for us – and ensuring that standardisation is not only the realm of large companies, but also respects the needs of SMEs. In cases like this, the risk is, of course, always very large that the large companies will go ahead and implement and the small companies will have to catch up, which can be a cost-intensive exercise. We have also managed to ensure that the support and the funding in this area have been safeguarded. The second area that was important to us was the removal of a section of the services that have recently been incorporated into this process, in particular, the removal of services of common economic interest and those of major importance to the professions. In this area, standardisation could be very dangerous, as these are fields that depend on creativity and the flexibility of service providers, and these must be safeguarded. We have reached a satisfactory compromise in this regard, and one in favour of which we, as a group, feel able to vote. As I said, though, there was a lot of work to do and I hope that things will be somewhat easier from here on in. Evelyne Gebhardt,  
rapporteur for the opinion of the Committee on the Internal Market and Consumer Protection.

 Mr President, we were very disappointed, Mr Barnier, to find that, in contrast to what was announced in the work programme for 2011, there was no legislative proposal, but merely a recommendation to the Member States. Therefore, I very much welcome the fact that today, you are showing your determination to submit a legislative proposal by the autumn at the latest, I hope, because we all know that calls to the Commission simply do not achieve anything. A total of 30 million citizens are waiting to have access to a basic account, so that they can perform the fundamental tasks that are part of life in today’s society. These 30 million citizens are seasonal workers, people on low incomes, the homeless and students, and all of them have a right to a bank account. We need to make sure that they get one. The basic account must also be cost-effective. We must not allow these people to be excluded again because of the cost, because they have no address or for some of the other reasons that are often given. We must ensure that they have a right to a bank account, because we cannot accept a situation in our society where there are first and second class citizens. For this reason, I very much hope that you will be able to persuade the College of Commissioners very quickly. We will help you, Mr Barnier, to make sure that the Member States ultimately also agree, because these really are fundamental rights. Evelyne Gebhardt  (S&amp;D
). 
 – (DE) 
Mr President, Commissioner, Mr Creutzmann, I believe that we are facing a very important issue here, and one that must be solved, regulated. I therefore very much welcomed it when the Commission brought forward this legislative proposal. This is about the safety of our citizens. We have obtained a great deal of information about how problematic counterfeit products are for people’s health and well-being, but also for pricing, and how important it is for businesses to be able to sell products that they have actually produced, in which connection it goes without saying that intellectual property rights must be properly protected. There are, however, a few issues that are still subject to fierce debate within Parliament. One such issue seems to have been resolved to some extent, and in that regard I would like to offer my sincere thanks to Ms Hedh, who produced great work in connection with generic medicines. The transiting issue is an absolutely essential issue in this context. We cannot accept the introduction of obstacles here that actually have nothing to do with the protection of intellectual property but relate to entirely different issues. We need to very carefully weigh up what we do in this area. Otherwise, Ms Hedh provided a very clear picture of what problems result in this context. The second point, which we believe to be very important – and, in this regard, I was very pleased by what you had to say earlier in respect of patent infringements, Mr Šemeta – is that the rule of law must be safeguarded in all cases. For that reason, if two of the amendments tabled by our group are not adopted, we as a group will not ultimately be able to vote in favour of the Creutzmann report, as we want there to be legal certainty here, but also that the rule of law and the rights of citizens in this connection should be safeguarded. It is therefore not all the same to us how the final vote goes. Our final vote tomorrow is therefore actually still in the balance. Evelyne Gebhardt,  
on behalf of the S&amp;D Group.

 Mr President, Commissioner, on the 20th anniversary of the internal market, the issue of the internal market really deserves the attention we are giving it today. It is one of our great achievements that we can move freely in the European Union, that we can sell our goods throughout Europe, that we have a high degree of product safety, and that we can bring citizens together here in this House, and it is a delight that we are working on it. It is therefore important, Mr Barnier, that you continue on the path you have embarked upon so as to ensure, together with us, that the positive aspects of the internal market are brought closer to citizens and that they recognise what they have gained from the European internal market. That is something that is missing, that citizens do not recognise, because we talk too much about problems and not enough about the achievements of the European Union. It is therefore also important that we concentrate more on what we have enshrined in Article 3 of the Treaty of Lisbon, which is that we want to have and also need a social market economy – and I place particular emphasis on the word ‘social’ – so that workers and consumers recognise themselves in Europe. I would also like to praise what Louis Grech highlighted in his report by adopting an holistic approach, which we need so that we can really see the internal market as a global concept and not as disconnected small actions that run alongside each other, and with which a philosophy of Europe is truly associated. It is really important to work on this together and we should continue to do so. The internal market is good, but there is one thing we should not forget: it must be structured for the benefit of citizens and not just for the benefit of enterprises and the financial world.

 Madam President, good levels of cooperation with the Member States of the European Economic Area (EEA) and the European Free Trade Association (EFTA) are very important to us. We enjoy a privileged relationship, which we wish to develop further in a highly positive way. However, this also means that both sides must adhere to existing agreements and, as the European Parliament and as Europeans, we must take care to ensure that no discrimination between the Member States of the European Union is allowed to creep in, whether in the interpretation of the wording of agreements, or in any other way. That is why I fail to understand the approach taken by the Swiss in applying the quota provisions that Switzerland is entitled to impose under the agreements. What we find unacceptable is that a distinction is made between Member States, in other words between the citizens of eight Member States of the European Union and the remaining States of the Union. This runs counter to the spirit of the European Union. We are all equal and must all be treated equally. That is why we cannot accept a distinction in this case. The provisions of Article 10 of the 1999 Agreement relate to employed and self-employed persons from the European Community. This is stated clearly in the agreements and we must insist that all citizens of the European Community are dealt with equally. This is the reason for our question to the European Commission regarding the status of discussions in this area with Switzerland. We would also ask you to clarify that we do not have first and second class citizens in the European Union and that the quota provision must apply to the European Community as a whole and that no distinction between citizens is permitted.

 Mr President, as there is a certain amount of confusion in my group with regard to what we are actually voting on here, I would like to point out that we are talking about a reference to the WARF judgment by the European Patent Office in which we want the whole of the technical theory behind the application to be taken into account. It is not about stem cells – they have absolutely nothing to do with this resolution. Evelyne Gebhardt,  
on behalf of the S&amp;D Group.

 Mr President, Mr De Gucht, this is an extremely important discussion. Of course, we are all in favour of inventions being patented and of protecting new products in a way that genuinely benefits the people who have invented them. However, when it comes to breeding methods in biological fields, we need to consider very carefully what actually constitutes an invention and what is just a discovery or a development of a natural breeding method. That is one of the questions which arises in the context of patenting. There are some cases, including tomatoes and broccoli, where we have to ask ourselves in which direction the Convention on the Grant of European Patents is moving. Mr De Gucht, you have yourself just admitted that, as far as patentability and the implementation and interpretation of the law in this field are concerned, there are some grey areas. It is precisely these grey areas we are referring to when we say that we need to think about how we handle this issue. We must ensure that the wide range of different varieties and breeds that we have in the European Union and the varied breeding methods, all of which have their own value, are not destroyed by patent claims that are too far-reaching. We must also ensure that small and medium-sized businesses can continue to develop and exercise their breeders’ privilege and that this is not ruined by granting patents which will prevent this privilege from being applied and which will no longer allow these businesses to make free use of the natural material that is readily available. This is one of the points that concerns us and we are asking the Commission, Mr De Gucht, to focus its attention on this area and to evaluate to what extent the bans which we imposed in the directive on the legal protection of biotechnological inventions, and which involved heated debates at the time, are really being respected. The principle that what the European Patent Office has laid down, in other words, that not only the explicit wording of the claims but also the overall technical theory behind the application needs to be considered, must be applied and respected.

Mr President, Commissioner, consumers experience a great deal of uncertainty when they go into shops and see a locally produced product. No one knows what that actually means. Does it actually come from somewhere local or is the yoghurt that is claimed to be local perhaps produced using milk that had first been transported a thousand kilometres? Is that what we as consumers want? It is time that we clarified what is actually meant by the term ‘locally produced’. Many citizens would like to know that. This is not because they want to pursue food nationalism, but because they take protection of the climate and the environment seriously, and they say: these natural products that I am buying today do not need to come from a long distance away when they can also be produced locally, and I would prefer that. These things are important. We want clarity so that responsible citizens can also take responsible decisions. After all, what does it mean to be able to take responsible decisions? It means receiving the information that you need to formulate the decision accordingly. These are things that we need to clarify. The Commission has, in fact, started to consider this matter. I would be very grateful, Commissioner, if you could tell us by when we can expect action to be taken by the Commission. When will we potentially also have legislative proposals on the table with which we will be able to provide citizens with an answer to these pressing questions? It is not a question of preventing products from coming from other countries. I always look forward to the delicious products from Spain that I can buy in Germany, because they cannot be produced in Germany. However, there are also products that are produced locally. It is important for us to ensure that citizens know where a product comes from, what the quality of the product is, and that there is not always a riddle associated with it in terms of how the information should be interpreted, what the quality label that they see means, and whether it actually has any value or any real meaning. This is the legal certainty that we want for our citizens. Evelyne Gebhardt  (S&amp;D

 Mr President, Commissioner Barnier, as rapporteur for the Services Directive, I did ensure, at that time, that services of common economic interest and services of general interest were excluded from the scope of that directive. At the same time I said that it is absolutely necessary for these services to be regulated at European level in order to protect them. Since then, we have seen the advent of the Treaty of Lisbon and its supplementary Protocol No 26, which gives the Commission a duty. Commission President Barroso promised us that he would act in this regard and we await real and substantial action from the Commission in this area. My question for you, Commissioner, is: when can we expect a legislative text from you? This is something that is needed, in my opinion. It is needed not because we want to regulate these services, but because we want to ensure that these services continue to remain in the hands of the competent people and bodies in the Member States, and with the highest possible level of quality. Evelyne Gebhardt  (S&amp;D
). 
 – (DE)
 Mr President, with respect, Commissioner, I do not see this the same way as you. What you have just presented is a breakdown of the legislation, and not the implementation of what is stipulated under Protocol No 26 of the Treaty of Lisbon, which quite clearly sets out that we need a legislative framework within which the protection of these services of general economic interest is to be regulated. That is something quite different to what you just presented to us I would like to know when you actually intend to implement the Treaty on European Union. Evelyne Gebhardt,  
rapporteur for the opinion of the Committee on the Internal Market and Consumer Protection
. – (DE) 
Madam President, the Committee on the Internal Market and Consumer Protection has also deliberated in detail on the Single Euro Payments Area, or SEPA, because this issue is very much concerned with consumer protection. I can state that I am very happy with the compromise reached, because it also incorporates some of the topics adopted by us in committee. It is a very good thing that we can say to consumers that we are thinking of them, too, in the area of the financial markets, because they do not always get that impression. Borders for payment transactions are borders in Europe. It is time that these were removed, so that they no longer stand in the way of European mobility. I very much welcome the fact that it has been established that, in future, all enterprises and consumers will be able to make euro payment transactions in other European countries from a single account at any bank. This is very important, particularly for small and medium-sized enterprises. Not just for enterprises, though, but also for consumers who are mobile, who go on holiday and who want to make credit transfers. It is also very good that we have ensured that there is a single migration date for credit transfers and direct debits. It would not have been good for consumers to have two different dates, as that would have resulted in greater confusion. Clarity and legal certainty – that is what we need, and that is what we have achieved here. My third and last point concerns the information given to citizens. That is also extremely important. A great many of them are afraid of this new SEPA number, of the new IBAN code, because it seems too long to them. If we tell them quite clearly how it is composed, however, then they will not find it so difficult and complicated at all. In other words, it is very important that we have an information campaign so that people know what this is all about. Evelyne Gebhardt,

 Mr President, Commissioner, the forum in Kraków really was a great success. This needs to be repeated, because good initiatives really ought to be continued. In this connection, I would like once again to thank Mr Grech, who as we know had the original idea that we should present the 20 most important concerns of citizens at such a forum. That was the key element of what we did, namely to place the concerns of citizens at the forefront so that they can see that the single market is not something abstract, but something that will actually provide them with added value. It concerned such diverse issues as the recognition of professional qualifications, the opportunity for young people to open a bank account in another Member State – which is sometimes very difficult – legal certainty in connection with online shopping, the Posting of Workers Directive, which urgently needs to be updated and amended, the strengthening of small and medium-sized enterprises and so on. Many subjects were discussed and the relevant problems highlighted. Commissioner, in future we need to put greater emphasis on the solutions on offer. In this regard, we await everything that you as the Commission have promised for next year, and Parliament and my group, the Group of the Progressive Alliance of Socialists and Democrats in the European Parliament, will monitor what you present to us with a very critical, but positive eye. Evelyne Gebhardt  (S&amp;D
). 
 – (DE) 
Madam President, the streamlining of the law in this area of mutual recognition of professional qualifications is extremely important. After all, we want policies that are in the best interests of our citizens. We all want our citizens to be able to move about freely and pursue their careers throughout the European Union. There are still far too many problems and obstacles raised by the Member States, as well as difficulties posed by European law, and it is important that we should tackle this issue. I am grateful to Mr Barnier, however, because he has stated that the answer does not necessarily lie in the deregulation of regulated professions. Those who favour such a move still have not indicated which professions they would like to see deregulated. I would like to know: are they talking about doctors, engineers or architects? I am not sure. What I am sure about is that regulation is extremely important and necessary. With regard to the professional card: this is something that would allow our citizens genuine freedom of movement, which is why we should not spend too much time on analysis, but instead should respond to the need expressed by those affected. Engineers and doctors were the first to say that they needed something like this to be able to move more freely around Europe, which is, after all, a political union. It is for this reason that we must say yes to this, and do so as quickly as possible. Evelyne Gebhardt  (S&amp;D

 Madam President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, public procurement is an extremely important task that we have for the future. I very much welcome the fact that the European Commission intends not only to improve legal certainty, but also to put right some aspects that have gone wrong. I would also like to thank the rapporteur, Ms Rühle, for having included a couple of points that are extremely important to those of us who are members of the Group of the Progressive Alliance of Socialists and Democrats in the European Parliament. Firstly, there is the issue that we must ensure that the rights of workers are safeguarded and that social criteria enjoy a prominent place. That is very important to us, because global sustainability includes ensuring that we do not generate poverty tomorrow but that instead, when awarding contracts, we also ensure that reasonable prices are paid, enabling us to protect the lives of workers. Another important point for us was, and remains, the fact that subcontractors are treated in exactly the same way as contractors – so that when contracts are awarded to contractors, the criteria cannot then be set aside because their subcontractors do not have to adhere to them. This is not a pipe dream, but rather it is a point that is very important to us: ensuring that legal certainty is brought about in this respect, so that we can genuinely make sure that public procurement remains transparent and comprehensible to the public, and so as to ensure fair competition between enterprises – particularly where small and medium-sized enterprises are concerned. Far from being inappropriate criteria, therefore, these are criteria that are extremely important. Evelyne Gebhardt  (S&amp;D

 Madam President, Mr Oettinger, the Commission shares the European Parliament’s concerns. This is very nice, but we have been waiting for years for the Commission to take action and to make some genuine progress in this area. We have Mr Busuttil’s report in front of us. In the last parliamentary term, the Committee on the Internal Market and Consumer Protection repeatedly highlighted the fact that we finally need to do something to help people. The problem is that people are still waiting for this help to arrive. Many of the small voluntary organisations that are affected do not have the financial means or the chutzpah to defend themselves. Only last week I received another letter asking: ‘How can I defend myself? I do not have the money for a lawyer, so I cannot take legal proceedings’. I believe that we must finally give the citizens of Europe an effective means of ridding themselves of this problem. Evelyne Gebhardt,  
on behalf of the S&amp;D Group.

 Mr President, I very much hope that it will be possible to rescue the 200 people who are in distress, because this is a very important matter. Thank you for informing us about this. Mr Barnier, Mrs Győri, ladies and gentlemen, Article 3 of the Treaty of Lisbon, which enshrines the social market economy, represents a new approach and a new political task for the future. Of course, we now have to complete this task and we have been waiting to do so for the last two years. I am pleased that the European Commission has made the first move in this direction. I am also very pleased that we in the Group of the Progressive Alliance of Socialists and Democrats in the European Parliament have succeeded, after a hard struggle, in ensuring that the social clause is included in the European Parliament’s position when we vote on this issue today. This is a very important question, because it forms the basis for social cohesion and will enable us to ensure that the internal market is regarded by people in the European Union as a social component. This is essential if we want the citizens of Europe to regain their trust in the political system in the European Union. In particular, the Commission must finally acknowledge the decisive significance of social rights in the internal market and put the focus on the social impact of European legislation. This is why it is important for Parliament to remind the Commission once again about the social clause which is enshrined in the Treaty of Lisbon. I would like to thank Mr Barnier for assuring us that he will take this into consideration and will follow this route. He can be sure of the full support of the Group of the Progressive Alliance of Socialists and Democrats in the European Parliament. Mr Barnier, the social clause also means, of course, that the Posting of Workers Directive must be revised accordingly. It means that the right to work and to strike must be respected in the Member States, together with the issues which really concern people, and that these rights must be incorporated into the internal market policy of the European Union without any ifs and buts and without restrictions. That is what concerns us as Social Democrats. If the internal market is developed on this basis, we will give you our support and our policy will be moving in the right direction. Of course, other questions are also important in this context. The recognition of professional qualifications, the European qualifications passport and the full transferability of pensions within the European Union are all issues which interest the citizens of Europe and which will ensure that the internal market is a market for the people. This is exactly what we Social Democrats are always saying. The economy is there for the people and not vice versa. If we follow this path, then we will be on the right track. Evelyne Gebhardt  (S&amp;D

 Mr President, I support the proposal by the Group of the European People’s Party (Christian Democrats), as it makes perfect sense to discuss this. I would just ask – in agreement with the coordinator of the Committee on the Internal Market and Consumer Protection, Mr Schwab – that we do not vote on the resolution this week, but wait until May to do so, because we have not yet had time to discuss this among the groups. Thus, I would say ‘yes’ to the inclusion of this item on the agenda, ‘yes’ to a resolution, but I would like the vote on the resolution to wait until May. Evelyne Gebhardt  (S&amp;D
). 
 – (DE)
 Mr President, I asked that the vote on the resolution on public procurement be postponed until May, which, of course, means that the deadline for the submission of resolutions and amendments would then also be postponed accordingly. You have not given us a chance to vote on that yet. Evelyne Gebhardt,  
on behalf of the S&amp;D Group.
 – (DE)
 Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, we did indeed experience some very tough negotiations, Mr Schwab, as opinions were very divided at the start of discussions. Likewise, it was not easy to decide on a reasonable course of action. However, these negotiations did succeed in achieving significant improvements, even after the vote at committee level, which finally made it possible for my group to vote in favour of this compromise package tomorrow. After all the discussions we have held, you will be aware of how much this means. We have indeed made a number of improvements. Accordingly, the fundamental principle followed in the directive is now, once again, minimum harmonisation – with the exception of the areas that are to be fully harmonised, which was an important concern for us. We excluded social services, healthcare services and games of chance from the scope of this directive because these are the areas that require special regulation. You cannot apply the same principles to them as to commercial services, commodities or retailing and so this was an important consideration. We have significantly strengthened the obligations to provide information to our citizens, the consumers. For this reason I would like to make it clear to the President-in-Office of the Council that the idea of dropping Chapter 2, in other words removing exactly the areas where this obligation to provide information is to apply, is something that the Group of the Progressive Alliance of Socialists and Democrats in the European Parliament will not tolerate. We have included electronic products in the scope of the directive, something not envisaged in the Commission’s original proposal. However, distance selling via the Internet is one of the key areas that has been included. As we reached the home straight, we also succeeded in improving the provisions on door-to-door selling. These are positive improvements that have enabled us to lend our support. I cannot deny that a few problems still exist, in particular the clauses relating to unfair contract terms in Chapter 5. We are very dissatisfied with these provisions and will either have to do some more work here or, if necessary, omit this section entirely. However, something that causes even more difficulty is the fact that financial services have been completely excluded from the obligations to provide information. I think we have a serious problem here. We will have to discuss this further, Commissioner, because financial services were included in your proposals and this should remain the case. To summarise: we will vote in favour of the compromise package and will also vote to refer the directive back to committee, but this does not mean that we agree to adopt the directive at first reading. Evelyne Gebhardt,  
rapporteur. 
– (DE)
 Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, here in the European Parliament, we have been debating the Services Directive for a long time, and we have expressed many concerns in our debates about how it should be implemented and how we can ensure that service providers have free movement within the European Union. This was an important piece of policy. That is why we, as Parliament, decided that we not only wanted to make the legislation, but that we also wanted to monitor how the Services Directive is actually transposed in the Member States. It is in our interest that the directive be transposed properly, correctly and well. The European Commission also agreed to help us in this regard. I would therefore like to thank Commissioner Barnier, who has provided us with valuable information in this connection. We have particular concerns about four specific areas, namely, the evaluation procedure, the points of single contact, administrative cooperation and the scope of the directive. On the first point, I have the following to say. Mutual evaluation is one of the core items where we, as Parliament, and I, as the then rapporteur, said actually, we are opposed to this, as this means an awful lot of bureaucracy in the Member States. I am also hearing from the Member States today that there are indeed complaints about the bureaucracy. In that regard, however, I would quite simply like to make it very clear to the Member States once again that they were the ones that wanted this, not Parliament! They inserted it into the legislation and, as such, they should take the responsibility for it themselves even if, for example, local communities are beginning to discuss what Europe has done to them again. On the question of the second point – the points of single contact – I would say that this is the answer to what we have done in the political sense. We said quite clearly that the principle of the Services Directive is not the country of origin principle but the country of destination principle. That means that service providers must respect the law of the State in which they operate. That makes it all the more important that they obtain from the points of single contact not only the information about the laws that they have to respect, but also the necessary assistance to enable them to really apply that law properly and consistently in the Member States. I therefore find it very regrettable that, while these points of single contact have been set up in many Member States – although not all of them as yet – this has only been done in a very unsatisfactory way. In some cases, they are merely Internet portals. That does not satisfy us, the European Parliament – there needs to be much more behind these points of single contact. There need to be people behind them who can provide real assistance for the service providers in this area. One issue here is the language that is provided. It is not enough to offer the local language and perhaps English. In my view – and Parliament has spoken in similar terms – it is important for service providers that the language of the neighbouring county is also spoken. I say this with one eye on our Polish President – in the border area between Germany and Poland, German should be offered in Poland and Polish in Germany so that the information and assistance are actually really good, so that even the small businesses, which are not all competent in English, can really get involved in cross-border activities. Administrative cooperation is another important point and it is an area where we are heading in the right direction. In this regard, the Member States still have an awful lot more to do in the area of cooperation and of the education and training of officials, so that this system can be really well used. Finally, we come to the scope, in which connection I would like to make it quite clear, once again, that we excluded all services of common economic interest from the scope of Article 16. I expect the Member States to respect that. If they want to include these services in the scope of the Services Directive, that is their right, but in that case, they must not sweep it all up as part of the Services Directive; rather, it is their own political statement of intent and something that they should also assume responsibility for themselves. That is what I demand of the Member States in this context. Evelyne Gebhardt,  
rapporteur.
 – (DE)
 Mr President, this debate was very interesting and illuminating. There was one observation I have to make, though, and that was that there are still people who continue to have in their heads the old Bolkestein proposal, which actually provided for liberalisation and deregulation, despite the fact that that really is a thing of the past and that the Services Directive, as constituted at present, is about enabling people to use their qualifications to offer services across the European Union. That is what this Services Directive is about, and it is important to keep saying so. I would like to stress that once again and we have also made that change quite clear. In addition, I would also like to remind you all that we absolutely do have a social clause in the Services Directive. This is because we have included, in Article 1, a clause whereby the labour and social law of the Member States cannot be jeopardised by the application of the Services Directive. Thus, if something like that were to happen in a Member State – and I did say this at the beginning – that would be an incorrect implementation of the Services Directive. If you want to speak of the Rüffert case and others, that has no relevance to the Services Directive. Such cases relate to the Posting of Workers Directive and its implementation and to the public procurement directives. Please do not fall into the trap of comparing apples and oranges. While apples and oranges perhaps both produce a good fruit stew, that is completely the wrong approach to take in politics. We therefore really need to very closely monitor what happens. I repeat my call for us to ensure that the Services Directive is correctly transposed in the Member States and not used to take rights away or to deregulate – that is not the job of the Services Directive. Of course, it remains a quite clear demand for us that we in the European Union in any case need a legal framework to protect services of general economic interest. I am eager to see what the Commission will produce for us in this regard. Evelyne Gebhardt,  
on behalf of the S&amp;D Group.

 Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, I would like to express my very sincere thanks to the rapporteur, Mrs Stihler, who has done some very important work in this highly technical area. It is not only a technical report that we have before us; it is also a highly political report – a report in which high political standards also had to be respected. It was necessary to balance the various interests of industry, safety and the protection of workers, and, in the view of the European Parliament and the Group of the Progressive Alliance of Socialists and Democrats in the European Parliament, the rapporteur has succeeded admirably in doing this. It was essential to respect the interests of the industry and to see where their problems are in this area of construction products. It was also important to find a balance between the large and the small and medium-sized enterprises. Our view was that the Commission was right to suggest that small enterprises need fewer rules. However, that does not mean – and this is where the Commission’s proposal was improved upon – that a lower level of safety should be permitted. The level of the standards must also be genuinely high, something that we managed to achieve in this area. Of course, it is also important to place safety at the forefront. This is of particular importance for consumers because, where a construction product is manufactured and installed, it must be ensured that the user of the product is ultimately just as safe as those who worked with it beforehand. The third point that was particularly important to us, as Social Democrats, was improving worker protection and the fact that this has also been explicitly incorporated once again. Mrs Stihler also attached a great deal of importance to this in her remarks. After all, these construction products often involve work with hazardous substances and materials. It is extremely important to ensure that the highest possible level of protection is indeed achieved in this area. This level of protection will also need to be considered later – and that is something that we probably still need to work on, Mr Tajani – in connection with the disposal of these products once they are no longer needed. I would like to thank the rapporteur most sincerely once again for her truly splendid work. Evelyne Gebhardt,

 Mr President, Commissioner, I would like to express my thanks to Mrs Weisgerber for the truly collegial collaboration that we enjoyed. I would like to say, on behalf of my group, that I am far from euphoric about the repeal of these eight directives. There are, in fact, a number of outdated measuring instruments for which the rules and regulations are being abolished, but we have noted in the debates that the devil is in the detail, as you yourself have said. It therefore was not always clear whether this route really was the right one to choose. My group will vote in favour of this compromise in light of the fact that we have obtained an assurance from the Commission that it will examine the idea of properly incorporating these measurement instruments into the European Measuring Instruments Directive (MID), which is, of course, being drawn up at the moment, where necessary. This commitment to investigate – this, too, I am assuming – will also be taken very seriously and given earnest consideration. We are voting for the compromise on this condition, well aware that there are still one or two issues that need to be investigated. As for the correlation tables, I would like to say, at this point, that we have now stated that we are ready to accept the mild wording that is currently to be found in this text but that this is one of the last documents in which we have accepted this, as, for us, this really is about European law, which is created once the Member States have given their consent, being truly and properly implemented. We can only check that, however, if we have the information, and we only get the information from these correlation tables. We will continue to work towards that, at all events. Evelyne Gebhardt,

 Mr President, year after year, we have this debate about the safety of toys. Year after year, we have to observe that there is still much that is in need of improvement. We are talking, here, amongst other things, about what are known as carcinogenic, mutagenic and reprotoxic substances (CMRs), substances that cause cancer and that may be very hazardous to the health and, in some cases, even the life of children. The new information does indeed show that we need to ensure that the limit values are adapted and we are calling on the Commission to finally do so. Commissioner, I really hope that this will actually happen. This is not the only problem, however. There is another problem in the shape of market supervision, and the Member States, too, have a responsibility here. They have a responsibility to ensure that only toys that truly satisfy the safety standards that we have adopted reach the market. That is not always the case, which is highly regrettable. We therefore need to ensure that these safety standards are improved. The third and final point that I wish to make relates to the marking of toys. Many people wrongly believe that the CE mark is an indicator of safety. It is not, however, as the Commission itself says. It is therefore time, Commissioner, that the Commission gave some thought to how we could issue a European safety mark that is truly reliable and that is monitored by third parties, independent authorities or bodies, so that a dangerous toy simply cannot make it onto the market or into the shops where it can threaten the health of our children. I believe that we have a major debt to discharge in this regard, and there is still much that we need to do, and urgently so. Evelyne Gebhardt  (S&amp;D

 Mr President, Mr Barroso, ladies and gentlemen, I believe that we have made major progress on behalf of the citizens of Europe with the Treaty of Lisbon, because we have included the social market economy among the principles of European policy. It is clear that we as Europeans and as parliamentarians expect the social market economy to be turned into a reality. Now we are looking at the internal market itself and the issues relating to the internal market as a whole and we can see that some of the things which should have been included have been omitted. It is not enough to carry out social impact assessments of European legislation. We need a social clause to be put into practice, so that the promises which were made that the citizens would really benefit from Europe are fulfilled and do not simply remain on paper. This is not just about the social clause, but also about important issues such as the services of general economic interest, which require special protection. It is very important to me that the European Commission finally addresses this question and looks more closely at issues concerning workers than was necessary, for example, in the context of the Posting of Workers Directive, where we are still waiting to find out what will happen next. Finally, and now I am slowly starting to get really annoyed, we have been calling on the European Commission for a long time to introduce a system for class actions at a European level. The Commission has already carried out six or seven different studies. What do we find now in this work programme? Another study has been commissioned. We cannot go on like this. We want the Commission to finally come up with some proposals and decisions in this area. Evelyne Gebhardt,

Madam President, thank you Commissioner Barnier for the work you have done. It was no easy task that you had and you have included something of what Professor Monti set out in his report and what Mr Grech drew up for the European Parliament. We can also see something of that in there, as well as the attempt to take the holistic approach, which has not succeeded in quite the way we imagined it would, but is nevertheless on the right track. It is also very important that you make it absolutely clear that you are attempting to make the social rights of citizens, which should, of course, be at the heart of the European Union’s legislation, a reality. However, on behalf of my group, I have to say that we feel some things in this text are too vague, too simple or too insignificant, or are missing altogether, because one of the crucial demands that we had, and which you also agreed to, was for a social clause to be included in all important areas of European policy. We cannot find this social clause. A commitment to carrying out social impact assessments could satisfy us. However, a social clause is significantly more than what we find here in this text. We will endeavour to help you so that we make progress in the right direction, because this is very important to us. There is another point that I find quite problematic and that was also very important to our group. We are calling for collective redress. We want collective redress for citizens so that they are also genuinely able to assert their consumer protection rights. On behalf of the European Commission, you announced that more studies are to be carried out. Studies have been carried out in this area for three years. I think it is time for us to get on with it and for us to actually receive a legislative proposal from you, not merely another proposal for a study to be carried out, so that we can see how we can move forward from here. As you see, there are some things that we are satisfied with, but other things that we are not so happy about and we will work hard with you, the Council and our fellow Members from the other groups to ensure that we ultimately have a genuinely good text.

 The fight against terrorism requires international cooperation governed by agreements. However, these must not erode the fundamental rights of citizens laid down in the European Charter of Fundamental Rights. In modern times in particular, these rights also include the protection of data, which is not adequately guaranteed by the SWIFT agreement negotiated with the United States. Combating terrorism must not become an excuse for inadequate data protection. Other serious shortcomings in this agreement include, for example, the inspection of bank data without judicial approval, the long retention period for data, something that is impermissible under German constitutional law, as well as an inadequate opportunity for people to defend themselves in court against the unfair use of data. These are serious infringements of fundamental rights. However, the European Union is not permitted to unduly curtail existing fundamental rights. I therefore still reject this SWIFT agreement.

Mr President, Mr Grech, I would like to congratulate you on the truly excellent report which you have tabled before us here and which provides us with a basis from which to move forward. Thank you also for using a phrase which I myself use all the time, namely that the economy is there for the people and not the other way around. That is precisely what the policy of the European Union should be based on. In your report, you also quite rightly point out that an adequate assessment of the social, consumer-related, environmental and economic impacts of the internal market, and the decisions we make in the internal market, are of particular importance. That is precisely what has been missing so far or what has not been made sufficiently visible to our citizens. It is a very important approach to point out the actual humanist and holistic elements of our policy, even when it comes to the internal market. In your report, you also state one thing which is particularly important for us Social Democrats, and that is that social policy should be considered as a core of internal market policy and that protecting services of a general economic interest is of particular importance. In addition, you call for the development of a strategy for improved communication of the social advantages of the internal market. If we consider just these few points, we realise that we could achieve a great deal if only the European Commission gave us its backing. I also very much hope that the Commission will genuinely take the opportunity presented by the Grech report to put the progress of EU citizens centre stage. I make that plea very strongly and, as we know, Mr Barnier has already agreed to do so. If we approach the internal market from that angle, the policy of the European Union will meet with greater acceptance and we will be able to look towards a better future. Evelyne Gebhardt,  
on behalf of the S&amp;D Group.

 Madam President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, as I follow this debate, I note that there is actually a great deal of uncertainty in relation to how the law is to be applied in these areas. Mr Andor, you just said that there is no European regulation laying down EUR 33 000 as a fixed limit. Dutch legislators, however, have laid down this limit of their own free will, probably because they were afraid that otherwise, the Commission would, at some point, require clear criteria to be put in place. This uncertainty leads to a great many difficulties in the Member States in relation to taking decisions themselves, specifically in terms of shaping those decisions so that they truly match up to what we need for these people and, in particular, for social housing, as these are people who do not have enough money to be able to move about freely. It is therefore very important for us to create a legal framework and legal certainty that also properly clarifies what is possible. Services of general economic interest, of course, really do need to be protected. They are provided at the local level in the Member States and they are universal and we need to ensure that they really are offered to everyone. We therefore have to consider – and I know this is being considered in the Committee on Employment and Social Affairs – demanding from the Commission a legal framework to protect services of general economic interest, especially in the social field, and I think that such a framework, were it to be provided, would be a good thing. Evelyne Gebhardt  (S&amp;D

 Mr President, Commissioner, Mr Manders, thank you very much for the good work that you have put into this regulation. I would also like to give particular thanks to my shadow rapporteur, since although this is indeed a technical report – as has been mentioned a number of times – it has many wide-ranging consequences for our citizens. After all, what we are concerned with here is allowing novel fibres to be placed on the market in the European Union. That is something we want to make possible. The European Commission is right in that. Not just anyhow, however; the fibres must be tested if citizens are genuinely to enjoy the consumer protection that we are always talking about. It is important, for example, to test whether the fibres are allergenic. They must also be clearly labelled, so that our citizens – who are always being described as responsible citizens – can also act accordingly. In this context, I must contradict the Members who have said that we should leave out country-of-origin marking. It is very important and absolutely right. Many citizens want to know where the fibres and textiles come from. What is their background? Their background includes the way in which they were manufactured. It is deplorable, but in many states, child labour or even slave labour are still used. There are citizens who want to know this information so that they can make a responsible choice when buying products. It may not be the job of this regulation, but it is the job of us Members to remind the Council of this and exert pressure to ensure that the text on origin marking that has been on the table since 2005 is at last put to good use. It is an opportunity to turn up this pressure and we should really seize it to achieve a good regulation about which our citizens say: yes, we can certainly live with that – that is the sort of thing we expect of our representatives in Parliament.

 Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, my group would actually have liked to support Mrs Rühle’s report, because it contains a great many very positive elements. Unfortunately, there are three points that we consider lacking or that we are unable to accept as they stand in the report. Firstly, Mrs Rühle was unable to accept that we genuinely have need of a legal framework for services in the general economic interest, and secondly, she also failed to state clearly that it is a matter of greater legal certainty in the area of social services in particular. This is a shortcoming of the report that we naturally find very regrettable. One point that we are absolutely unable to accept is the rejection of service concessions. We cannot simply say that it is something we do not want. The Court of Justice has already ruled on all this. It is highly unpolitical. It is very important that we say quite clearly what we want if we know that the European Commission is preparing a legal text. It is important that we call upon the European Commission actually to go along with the very positive position taken by the Court of Justice on this matter, thereby also ensuring legal certainty. That is our demand and consequently, we have submitted an alternative resolution. We ask our fellow Members to support this alternative resolution. Evelyne Gebhardt,

 Mr President, Commissioner Barnier, Commissioner Dalli, ladies and gentlemen, today we are talking about the internal market, consumer protection and the mobility of people within the European Union. These are the key issues when we are discussing these three instruments and they are what I want to address in particular. Bringing these three topics together provides a very great advantage for us today, because the economy and the rights of consumers and workers are not intrinsically opposed to one another; they need to be brought together. This is something that we need to make progress on for the future. That is why it is good that we are having this joint debate today. In order to make this a reality, we need, above all, to bring three political principles to the fore. Firstly – and Commissioner Barnier put this very well earlier – protectionism, which is still very much in evidence in the national governments of the Member States, needs to be overcome. That is something we need to do in any case and it is on the agenda. The second political principle is that we must guarantee a high level of protection of the rights of both consumers and workers. In other words, the internal market does not mean the abolition of rights and it does not mean deregulation. It means ensuring that we preserve our very high level of common rights in these areas. For this reason, there is one paragraph in Mrs von Thun Und Hohenstein’s report that we do not agree with. This concerns the so-called Internal Market Scoreboard or internal market test. This is the wrong approach. It gives the impression that the only important thing is how the market is functioning. That is not the case. We need to ask what impact the European Union legislation will have on the rights of workers and on the rights of consumers. We therefore reject this concept, because it is the wrong one. Thirdly, we need good enforcement of these rights at European level. For this, we need a system of collective redress so that consumers do not stand alone in this internal market, but are also able to really assert their rights. Evelyne Gebhardt,  
on behalf of the S&amp;D Group.

 Mr President, Commissioner, thank you very much for the information you have given us but, to be honest, I am not entirely satisfied. The previous Commission set itself the quite clear objective of liberalising the gambling market. The European Parliament has made it clear, time and again, that this cannot be the right approach, because it was the European Parliament, rather than Member States, that, for example, removed gambling from the scope of the Services Directive. We took the view that it is not just any other service, that we must ensure that we introduce safeguards which will protect our citizens from organised crime and that we require clear rules to that end. Nonetheless, the European Commission continues to bring Member States before the European Court of Justice, and it is time that the Commission ceased this practice as it keeps losing cases at the Court. You simply have to face this fact. I would, therefore, welcome it, Mr Barnier, if you put what you have just said, that is, that a different approach is needed in this area, into practice because we cannot proceed with things remaining as they are now. In response to your point, Mr Harbour, I would argue that the rulings of the European Court of Justice have been very consistent and not at all contradictory. In its judgments, the Court has stated, time and again, that Member States have the right to introduce clear rules, so that we can truly verify whether or not citizens are protected against crime, and that Member States are not under any obligation to open this market up. Nor are they under any obligation to allow market operators from other Member States to operate on their territory, as long as they make sure that their controls are strong and effective. That is what we want to see from the European Commission, that it has finally grasped this and acted accordingly. However, this also means that we have to pay particular attention to online gambling, because the Internet does not recognise any barriers or borders and, of course, because our citizens have access to gambling sites. We need to think about how we can shape controls and rules in this area, so that our citizens are protected. Evelyne Gebhardt  (S&amp;D

 Mr President, Mr Barroso, we were very happy to have got the Treaty of Lisbon in place on 1 December and, along with that, a stronger social policy and a strengthening of the position of consumers in the area of internal policy within the European Union. However, we now find that you – contrary to what is contained in the Treaty of Lisbon, namely a horizontal commitment to protect consumers – have done exactly the opposite with the division of the portfolios in your European Commission, because now there is not just one commissioner responsible for consumer protection, but several. I would like to ask you how you actually intend to handle this. How do you intend to establish coherence in this policy area, an area that is extremely important to consumers, to European citizens? The responsibilities have been divided up. Which commissioner will provide this coherence? Please do not tell us that it is the College that will decide. We need clear areas of responsibility. Please do not say to us, either, that ultimately you will decide in the event of a dispute between the different commissioners. You are not almighty and you belong to a College. I have serious difficulties with this, Mr Barroso. You need to explain to me how you can truly get to grips with this fragmentation of policy in the area of consumer protection, but also in other areas like foreign policy, so that we have a policy that, after five years, will allow us to say ‘yes, it was worth having a Commission like this’. I do not yet know how I will vote later. That will depend very much on your answers to our questions. Evelyne Gebhardt,

 Mr President, I would first like to say that it is totally outrageous that there are no members of the Commission here, because this is a question directed at the European Commission. This shows contempt for Parliament. It is simply outrageous and we find it totally unacceptable. (Heckling)
 Yes? Yes, he did not get up. Well, I am sorry. I cannot accept that. Moving on to the matter in hand, ladies and gentlemen, this is all about the citizenship of the Union, about the people who have the right to move freely throughout the European Union and to practise their professions where they live and where they choose to work. We have put this legislation in place so that this will become easier and so that the process of recognising professional qualifications can genuinely be brought up to date. I find it simply appalling that the Member States in many cases have not taken the necessary steps to implement this legislation and to ensure that citizens really have this freedom of movement. There is still a great deal to be done by the European Commission in this respect. I would like to draw attention to one point which is very important to me and which we have repeatedly brought up in Parliament. We must ensure that the European professional card, which we have proposed, is introduced. This will put into citizens’ hands something that will allow them to move throughout Europe. There are organisations which are attempting to do this. However, I feel it is important to ask the European Commission whether this is an area in which it could become involved in order to speed this process up. Evelyne Gebhardt,  
on behalf of the S&amp;D Group.

 Mr President, I am grateful that we are able to debate this topic today, as it is such an important one. I would like to make one thing absolutely clear: as Parliament, we have not merely played a part, but we have ensured that, in this Services Directive, a very positive, constructive compromise was found. This compromise is based, in particular, on guaranteeing labour and social rights and on the particular regard for and removal of the services of general economic interest. That was the reason why a Services Directive was possible in the first place. However, there are a few things than I am not sure about in this regard, and the questions that we raised have not been answered. It would, for example, be very disappointing if what I have heard from various sources turned out to be true, namely, that some Member States are using the transposition of the Services Directive to destroy the balance that we, as legislators, have found by not fully respecting the rights of workers as we envisaged in the Services Directive. This relates not only to the working conditions, which are being called into question, but in many Member States, the definitions are also being re-written or made more restrictive. There are also Member States which, with feeble justifications, are not removing the social services from amongst the services to which this transposition relates. In this respect, the European Commission’s Handbook was not very helpful, because the guidelines that it gave were partly wrong and it provided an interpretation that was, in our opinion, incorrect. The examples that I have given show how important it is for us also to create a legal framework for services of general economic interest, so that social rights, such as labour rights, can also be fully and completely respected once again. Anything else would not be sufficient. I would also like to ask the Member States to what extent they have involved the stakeholders and, in particular, the trade unions and the social services, in the transposition. This is a question that we raised, but to which I have not heard an answer, and I would very much like a good answer to this question. Evelyne Gebhardt (S&amp;D).

 Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, one thing needs to be stated very clearly: there is a unified system in China and we do not want to allow this system to break up. We respect the Chinese system. However, that does not mean ... (Interruption by Mr Posselt)
 We respect China’s unified system. However, that does not mean that the diversity of peoples in China must not also be respected. That is what we Social Democrats are calling for. We want citizens’ rights, human rights and people’s freedom to be respected in China. We want freedom of expression to be respected. We want journalists to be able to move around freely so that the situation as it really is can indeed be reported. That is what we want and there is one thing that we would say very clearly to our colleagues in China: what for us is a basic principle we would also expect to be a basic principle for you in China, namely that human rights are universal. What the politicians always say to us – let us first solve the social problems and then we can talk about human rights – is the wrong way to go about things. It must be the other way round. Human rights come first and then social rights, which are quite simply part and parcel of human rights and cannot be separated from them. I was therefore very disappointed by what you said, Mr Bildt. You seemed to be saying: let us work together on an economic level, that is our main concern and all of the other things are of no particular interest to us. That is not the approach that we need. We need to take the approach presented to us by the European Commission, namely to say that we first want a common basis for our work on which we can then build our cooperation, because we do want cooperation, that much is clear, but not on any basis, only on a correct basis that respects human dignity.

Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, the need for European solutions and European emergency plans is nowhere more obvious than in the case of European rivers, since they connect European countries. A bad example of this is the catastrophe two years ago when contaminated sludge from a Hungarian aluminium factory flowed into the Danube. It became obvious in that case how important cooperation is. Furthermore, seamless transport connections are especially important. As co-rapporteur of the report on the development of the trans-European transport network, I consider inland navigation as an important means of transport, because it is environmentally friendly and still has potential for growth. At the same time, we must also comply with emissions targets. We cannot expand at any cost. This means that we must place ecological considerations and environmental protection in the foreground and at the heart of this process.  We have heard today that one of the last free-flowing sections of the Danube between Straubing and Vilshofen is this kind of bad example. In my view, the environment must take precedence here. In the meantime, the CSU environment minister in the government of the state of Bavaria has recognised this. Now he has to convince his Bavarian Prime Minister and the Federal Transport Minister that any investment in further studies is unnecessary and that any investment – I refer here to the EUR 16.5 million which the Commission has also invested in this study – is, unfortunately, money spent in vain. It would be better spent – as Mr Theurer has mentioned – in the Danube Youth Foundation. This is the direction we need to take in future.

Mr President, Ms Lochbihler, thank you for your question. There is actually a certain contradiction in the Danube region strategy: on the one hand is the objective of environmental protection and on the other hand is the objective of supporting those who want to destroy the Danube. I will say quite clearly: it must not be a question of mobility at any price. The ships that travel on rivers must adapt to the rivers, not vice versa. If we give both these objectives equal importance, I can see how we can achieve both goals. Ecological considerations are at least as important as economic components. Ismail Ertug  (S&amp;D

Mr President, Mr President-in-Office of the Council, I would like to congratulate you on taking over the presidency and wish you every success in the job you have to do in these difficult times. You will need to be fully committed, Mr Christofias, when it comes to stimulating growth and creating jobs in the European Union. We are very interested in the specific solutions that you propose for combating youth unemployment You will have the support of Parliament if you take on this problem. The negotiations on the multiannual financial framework naturally have a high priority. You have rightly recognised, and I congratulate you on this, that the financing of the Trans-European Networks will bring significant added value to Europe. I would like to call on you to make a strong commitment to push through in the Council the approach to financing called for by the Commission. Your country will benefit from this, Mr Christofias. For example, the port of Limassol is part of the core transport network, as is Larnaka airport and the road project linking Limassol and Nicosia, which could receive European funding. When we talk about Cyprus, we are, of course, also referring to an unresolved problem which has already been mentioned several times today. Mr Christofias, what sort of scenario should the European Union expect if there is no solution for Cyprus, which after 38 years of unsuccessful negotiations seems more likely than ever?

 Mr President, rapporteur, ladies and gentlemen, I think it is clear that the European Union’s aim is to ensure a better common railways policy. This legislation helps bring that about. In this respect, it will help, for instance, by opening up basic services for the market, which is a beneficial thing to do. I would also like to offer the rapporteur specific thanks for also having stuck to the multiannual financial plans between infrastructure operators and the Member States, as doing so facilitates long-term planning in respect of funding, which provides a certain degree of planning certainty and, above all, it will have a positive impact on the development of the European railway market. We have heard a number of times today already that the most important element in this legislation will be organising the national regulatory bodies as they actually should be organised, which is to say, with more powers and such that they are not as weak as they are in many Member States of the Union. The situation today is that we have regulatory authorities that are unable to make it possible for other competitors to enter the market, and this means that market access is made more difficult. Under this legislation, such unfair practice will, first of all, be monitored and then it will also be eliminated and made possible for punishment to be imposed. My final point concerns what I would definitely consider a step in the right direction, by which, of course, I mean transparency in the financial flows. In this respect, it needs to be very clearly emphasised that this obviously must not pave the way for the pre-emption of the separation of networks and operators, as that would be too serious an intrusion into national subsidiarity rights. We should therefore leave it at that. I would like to offer my sincere thanks to the rapporteur once again, and especially also to the shadow rapporteurs, for the fact that we have produced such sound legislation. Ismail Ertug  (S&amp;D

 Mr President, first of all, let me add my voice to those thanking the rapporteur for her outstanding work, as well as the shadow rapporteurs, of course. This was a tough job, we are well aware of that. It has always been Parliament’s aim to ensure increased road safety. With various laws, this venerable House has helped to also bring that about. I would remind everyone at this juncture, just by way of example, about the issues of overtiredness behind the wheel and the fight against the exploitation of workers. Irrespective of this, it is, of course, important to constantly adapt to technical changes, technical developments. On that basis, we must continue to prevent manipulation of the devices in future, too, clearly while adhering to strict data protection provisions. Another point that is very important to me and which is achieved by means of this document is the harmonisation of the specific measures for the training of control officers and, very interestingly and importantly, the approximation of penalties. When it comes to the derogation, I would insist that this 150 kilometre stipulation for handicraft businesses be maintained, as this is important for the business of these companies.

The Tymoshenko case and political developments in Ukraine in general indicate that democracy and the rule of law still remain values that cannot be taken for granted in today’s Europe and for which we must actively campaign. The thirst for reform seemed enormous in Ukraine in the period following the Orange Revolution and the country quickly became a perfect example of the success of European neighbourhood policy. In this context I find it extremely regrettable that political life in Ukraine is once again characterised by political trials, political meddling in the administration of justice and state interference. The response of the European Commission and a number of Member States to the latest events is decisive but by no means excessive. The absence of the most senior Members of the Commission from the European Championship in Ukraine sets down a clear marker, but should not divert attention from the problems in the country and the possible solutions. For this reason I welcome your intention, Mr Füle, to continue with the association process with Ukraine if there are positive developments and, above all, if free and fair elections are held this autumn. In order to be able to provide positive support for developments in Ukraine in future, European neighbourhood policy must also incorporate the wishes and expectations of the people of Ukraine. Before we intensify our partnership, however, Yulia Tymoshenko must be given fair treatment. Naturally this must take her health into consideration and must be free from all state interference.

 The resolution before us sends out a clear signal and supports the conviction that the social democrats have had for a long time that the crisis can only be overcome if the financial sector is put in its place. To avoid the excesses of the banks in 2008 from being repeated in the future, we need to rigorously pursue two goals. Firstly, ladies and gentlemen, it must not be possible for banks to operate in such a short-sighted and reckless manner in the future. Secondly, we must invest more in the real economy in order to stem the power of the financial sector in today’s economy. Both of these things can be achieved by the planned tax. Even the extremely low tax rates of 0.01% and 0.1% would provide the Member States with additional resources of up to EUR 100 billion. That EUR 100 billion could relieve the burden on severely stretched budgets and be used to invest in lasting growth. I am confident that you will all use your votes to give this proposal the necessary emphasis, and I call on all the Member States not to block the Commission’s proposal in the Council. However, should such a common EU-wide solution fail due to a handful of naysayers, then the remaining Member States must set a good example by pushing ahead via the process of enhanced cooperation.

 Mr President, Mr Kallas, as competition increases in the years to come, we can expect the volume of traffic to increase even further. If we look at the figures again, it becomes clear that more than a quarter of our current CO2
 emissions are produced by transport. This means that we must reduce our CO2
 emissions and increase the efficiency of our transport systems. In my opinion, you have taken the right approach in your document. Your proposal for new guidelines is primarily about giving priority to environmentally friendly means of transport. However, now we come to the ‘but’, Mr Kallas. This makes it all the more incomprehensible to me that you have seriously considered permitting cross-border transport on Europe’s roads using so-called monster trucks or gigaliners. I would be grateful if you could explain to us why you are considering this, without waiting for the analyses on road safety and the environment, and how you plan to proceed in future. You know that this is a very sensitive subject and that we are opposed to these trucks. Ismail Ertug  (S&amp;D

 All of us have painful memories of the images of the burning Deepwater Horizon oil platform in the spring of 2010. Outdated technology and the conscious acceptance of safety risks led to the two-month long outflow of incredible quantities of crude oil. As we all know, the consequences for people and the environment were disastrous. The fact that there is a danger of the same thing happening at the 450 drilling rigs in the North Sea, for example, was demonstrated in August of this year by the oil leak in the Gannet Alpha pipelines off the Scottish coast. I therefore welcome the proposal put before us to extend the areas of competence of the European Maritime Safety Agency in this regard, so that in future, safety inspections can also be carried out on oil drilling rigs. EMSA has already proven its ability to act in connection with past tanker disasters. On the basis of this experience, I believe that the proposed extension of the areas of competence is preferable to the creation of a new agency. In addition, this kind of European solution to maritime safety problems is preferable to having national supervisory authorities. The faster lines of communication and the cross-border consequences of incidents such as oil disasters can only be tackled at European level. Finally, I would like to thank Mr Fleckenstein for his excellent work as rapporteur and I call on all my fellow Members to support this important dossier. Ismail Ertug  (S&amp;D

 Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, the White Paper on transport was proposed by the Commission in order to set European transport policy goals for the next 20 or 40 years. I know that 40 years is perhaps a very extensive period. However, we must nevertheless bear in mind that transport projects require lengthy planning phases. I therefore support the long-term approach taken by the Commission. Let us take a look at the ambitious goals of the Commission, which I support: increased safety through the use of intelligent transport technologies, improved traffic routing using multimodal solutions, the internalisation of external costs and, above all, transport must become even more environmentally friendly. There are some good approaches and, in this regard, I would refer to the legislative proposals for environmentally friendly urban transport up to 2015. While we are on the subject of environmental protection, I would once again like to point out that it is extremely important to reduce greenhouse gas emissions still further. As regards the development of inland waterways, I would also like to take this opportunity to mention once again the planned development of the Danube. In this regard, we must ensure that this does not ultimately damage the natural environment. I would like to quote Mr Cramer here, who quite rightly always says that ships must be adapted to the river and not the other way around. I am pleased to see that good amendments were tabled in this regard. I would like to thank the rapporteur once again for being so ready to compromise. Finally, I would like to mention one more thing: I would have liked us to have implemented the 300 km approach in connection with the shifting of goods transport from the roads onto the railways. However, I would essentially like to say thank you very much and I hope this will be successful. Ismail Ertug  (S&amp;D

Madam President, Mr Koumoutsakos, ladies and gentlemen, the report on the Commission’s proposal for a programme to support the further development of an integrated maritime policy is one way to achieve the objectives of the Treaty of Lisbon and to increase coherence between the various policy areas. It is a welcome development that solutions have been sought on a cross-departmental basis in maritime policy and that an attempt has also been made to create synergies. Maritime policy goes beyond marine transport and fishing. Industry, research and alternative power generation, as well as environmental protection, are areas that are inseparably associated with the classic aspects of maritime policy. For this reason, there is a need for improved coordination between policy areas and between Member States with access to the sea. The report has improved on the Commission’s proposal on several counts. In this context, I expressly welcome the fact that more attention has been paid to environmental protection, the protection of species and the sustainable use of maritime resources, an aspect which, I must say, could have been given even more prominence in the Commission’s proposal. Mr Koumoutsakos, I hope that you receive a broad negotiating mandate for your report and would also like to thank Mr Milana for his work and wish you all the best for the future.

 Madam President, Ms Serracchiani, ladies and gentlemen, this proposal takes us one step closer to a simpler, more effective joint rail policy. The significantly strengthened regulatory body and financial plans spanning several years will help make rail travel more competitive and reliable. I am also particularly pleased that the rapporteur has succeeded in including social aspects in the focus of the report. After all, an integrated rail market must offer employees the same high-standard working conditions throughout the European Union. In this context, it is correct that the right to strike should remain inviolable. Opinion has been divided for some time in relation to the separation of the rail network and the operating companies and I would like expressly to thank the rapporteur for her tenacity and willingness to negotiate, because this has helped us find a well-balanced compromise. We now await the legislative proposal from the European Commission. Finally, I would ask and encourage you all to give our rapporteur broad support with a mandate that will enable her to enter into discussions and negotiations with the Council. A solid path has been laid. With this in mind, I would like to thank the rapporteur and wish her well. Ismail Ertug  (S&amp;D

 The road safety measures called for in the report are practical and ambitious. That is the only way that we can reduce the number of accidents on Europe’s roads in future. With the call for a stringent alcohol ban for newly qualified drivers and professional drivers and the call for a ‘vision zero’, Parliament can send out a clear message that road safety has top political priority and road deaths are simply not morally acceptable. If the Commission and the Council get behind the measures that we have proposed, we can at last actually begin to work towards such ambitious objectives. Ismail Ertug  (S&amp;D

 Poland joined the EU seven years and two months ago and we are pleased to see it take over the Presidency of the Council of the European Union. Poland is putting its hand to the tiller at a time when Europe is facing great challenges in terms of its finances, energy policy and internal politics. We therefore doubly welcome the fact that Poland also intends pursuing ambitious goals in transport policy. We Social Democrats welcome the fact that you intend to promote the improvement of social conditions for workers in the transport sector. By taking up the expansion of the Trans-European Transport Networks, you are not only planning to keep in view economic and territorial cohesion, but also the social cohesion of the various regions of the EU. As an advocate of sustainable transport policy, I am particularly pleased that your priorities are in line with those of the White Paper on Transport and that you are anxious to work with Parliament to find a speedy solution for the new version of the first railway package. With this in mind, we look forward to positive collaboration. Ismail Ertug  (S&amp;D

 For me, one particularly important issue with regard to security scanners is that the machines which are available must meet the necessary technical requirements, so that they do not slow down the operational processes and, therefore, lead to undesirable results. The main problems in my view are a reduction in passenger comfort and the introduction of complex processes which ultimately do not bring any increase in security. Unfortunately, past experience indicates that difficulties of this kind may occur. It is important to make the deadline for introducing the new systems dependent on the technology being fully functioning rather than on a specified date. In addition, it must be possible to combine the new machines with systems for detecting liquids. I would also like to highlight the fact that issues of space and structural engineering need to be taken into consideration in the case of the control unit (in other words, the security scanner and the X-ray device). Major structural alterations will be needed at many airports to support the weight of the machine and to make the necessary space available. The throughput rate for passengers must be equivalent to the existing figures at the passenger checkpoints. Otherwise there will be significant operational and quality problems. It is essential that the airports are able to put realistic plans in place. We must not forget that the necessary facilities must be made available, including space for the machines, structural engineering work and training measures, and that comprehensive plans are needed which cover the time and funding needed for the alterations to the buildings.

− (DE) My aim is still to achieve a uniform ban on genetically modified organisms (GMOs) in all Member States. We cannot tell what impact GMOs will have on our health, because the technology is still too new. The fundamental problem is that it has spread so rapidly. Having once introduced the technology, it is now impossible to get rid of it. Therefore, I welcome the fact that we are adopting a report today which makes a ban on GMOs possible and which strengthens consumers’ rights. Once again we are reinforcing consumers’ rights more effectively than the Member States have done. The European Parliament was responsible for introducing the mandatory labelling of GMOs last year, not the Council of Ministers. This report makes it possible for Member States to impose a ban on GMOs, because of the fear of pesticide resistance, for example. The fact that the World Trade Organisation (WTO) does not feel that concerns about the health of the population are sufficient grounds for a ban causes me to have very serious doubts about the WTO.

Madam President, as you said, Mr Kallas, the gigaliners or monster trucks or whatever you want to call them are a controversial subject. You mentioned efficiency gains in terms of fuel consumption. I would like to know what exactly these efficiency gains are. I know that those in favour of these trucks say that you can make one truck out of two. This would ultimately result in warehousing as we know it today becoming less expensive and it would be cheaper to drive goods around on the streets than to store them in warehouses, with the result that making one truck out of two would actually have exactly the opposite effect. I would like to ask you to consider this, because it would mean that we would have more trucks on the roads than we did before. You have announced various studies on the subject of the monster trucks. What is happening with them? What results have you so far received? What are the next steps to be taken? I would be interested in knowing more, because Germany does not have a uniform approach to these trucks and most people are opposed to them. Ismail Ertug  (S&amp;D

Mr President, Commissioner, President-in-Office of the Council, ladies and gentlemen, over 31 000 people a year are still dying on European roads. That being so, I find it negligent, to say the least, that the Member States’ transport ministers have blocked such an important instrument in the Council for over two years. As representatives of the people, you should be keen, for the safety of your citizens, to ensure that drivers from non-Member States cannot disregard traffic rules with impunity. The fact that we shall be voting on this proposal tomorrow is due, above all, to our rapporteur’s persistence. Like her, I too am disappointed that the Council has changed the legal basis for this directive, thereby provoking an opt-out by three Member States. This will create a law for EU-wide prosecution of traffic offences that will not be applied throughout the EU and I consider this less than perfect, to put it mildly. This disappointment notwithstanding, it is another important step towards closer cooperation in the road traffic sector and I should like to ask you all to vote in favour of this compromise tomorrow. I should like to point out once again that the rapporteur campaigned extremely hard for a strong review clause and to thank her for that; I hope that, when the review comes around within the next five years, the transport ministers will be not only older, but also wiser.

 We in the Group of the Progressive Alliance of Socialists and Democrats in the European Parliament have worked hard to ensure that the new EU agricultural policy is oriented towards ecological standards. In our view, farmers must be rewarded for providing services to society. That is exactly what they do, and nothing could be rewarded less in the prices currently being achieved at market. Retaining the two-pillar model guarantees that farmers will continue to receive a fixed amount in the future that they can rely on. These payments are important for long-term planning. By linking the direct payment to an economic variable we can achieve the transition from a Europe of 15 Member States to a Europe of 27 without offending anyone too much. The report is a good compromise; it is a European compromise. The question now is what the Commission, and particularly President Barroso, will make of it. Cutting the funding for environmental protection in particular suggests narrow-mindedness, and I hope Commissioner Cioloş will be able to talk him out of it. Ismail Ertug,

 Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, following a negotiations marathon, Mr El Khadraoui and the representatives of the Council and the Commission managed to tie up an improved package of measures for road charging for heavy goods vehicles in Europe. I am very grateful to those involved and, in particular, to our rapporteur, for what they have achieved. Through the recognition of the principle of internalising external costs, the partial earmarking of funding for the transport infrastructure and the incentives provided for fleet renewal, we have succeeded in realising important objectives from the Transport White Paper. I also believe that we must not overlook the obligations for transparency, which ultimately must also apply to the Council. I find it highly regrettable that several Member States attempted, even after the conclusion of the trialogue negotiations, to throw a spanner in the works – they really did try – in connection with the correlation tables in order to block this directive. Nonetheless, I would like to conclude by calling on all my fellow Members to accept the compromise achieved and not to jeopardise the results of these long and laboured negotiations, as all that would achieve would be to help the wrong people. You have my thanks for backing this compromise. Ismail Ertug  (S&amp;D

 We are absorbing antibiotics in our food, which is resulting in increased resistance. This is one area of medical progress which is gradually being ruined and we have known about this for a long time. Mr De Castro referred to the measures that have already been taken. I support the proposals made in the resolution. There are two aspects of this which I would like to focus on. Regulations alone are not enough. In the dioxin scandal, we have seen how easily they can be undermined, if individual ‘black sheep’ behave in a very negligent way. Of course, we must have regulations and we need to introduce monitoring systems, but that is not the entire solution. In the medium and long term, the solution is to make the use of antibiotics largely superfluous. We can achieve this firstly by investing in research and networking expert knowledge, secondly, by passing this knowledge on to farmers and vets and thirdly, by providing information to consumers. We must make clever use of market forces, because it is consumers who decide in the long term how their food is produced. Ismail Ertug  (S&amp;D

 Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, the volcanic ash of last year showed us in an impressive way where our weaknesses lie. The question therefore arises as to how we should deal with such situations in the future. It is, of course, first and foremost a question of the safety of those people who board an aeroplane. Of course, we must also keep in mind how we intend to deal with the financial losses. My question to the Commission is therefore – Mr Hahn, perhaps you could also pass this on to Mr Kallas – what, in specific terms, are we planning? I would argue that it is particularly important for us to take over the coordination when it comes to test flights and limit values. That is very important in order for us to know which aeroplanes can take off and when. I have another comment, Commissioner: it is extremely important – and this has already been referred to many times – to establish the Single European Sky. What does the Commission intend to do in terms of exerting pressure on the Member States to actually fulfil their obligation in this regard? After all, they have put their signatures to it. Another important point, which has already been made several times today, is what happens now with regard to passengers’ rights in air transport. We have Regulation (EC) No 2061 from 2004. What does the Commission intend to do in this regard? We are aware of the problem of the financial losses suffered by the various airlines. I would also like to point out once again that we need alternatives to air transport, and by that I mean the rail system. I am also one of those who believe that we must link the large cities – Europe’s capital cities – together. In this case, too, the answer is that we need more involvement from Europe, not less. I would be pleased if the Commission would give its attention to these issues. Ismail Ertug  (S&amp;D

Madam President, Mr President-in-Office of the Council, Mr Füle, I would like to wish you every success with your work in future. It is hard to ignore the ambivalence of the Cyprus issue. We in the European Union must not dismiss apparently unpleasant issues or try to pretend that they do not exist. We have not kept our promise. That is a fact and we must resolve these double standards. We know that the Ankara Protocol must definitely be implemented with regard to the Cyprus question. However, it is also clear, as stated by the Council in 2004, that the isolation of Northern Cyprus must come to an end. I am pleased that Southern Cyprus is providing the north with the necessary support, but this was not the intention of the European Union. Its intention was that everyone, the entire EU, should bring an end to the isolation. In order to overcome the final obstacle in this area, we must take a step forwards and put a stop to this isolation. Ismail Ertug  (S&amp;D

 Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, Turkey is, of course, an emotional topic, that is quite clear. There is one thing that we should, of course, always take into account in this context, and this has been mentioned several times today, namely that, although the prohibition of the party is totally unacceptable, it was not pronounced by the government, but by the judicial system. We need to draw a distinction here in order to be fair and honest. However, that was not what I wanted to say. As Europeans, we must ask ourselves where we actually want to go. If, as a global player, we want to pass on not only economic – and as a Social Democrat I would like to emphasise this – but also political values, not only in Europe but also beyond European borders out into the world, then for this, ultimately, we need Turkey. It will also give us the opportunity to be firm and clear in our dealings with Turkey, which is exactly what is required. Only then will we succeed in setting a democratisation process in motion in order to succeed in our overall purpose. Jens Geier,

Madam President, President Caldeira, Commissioner Šemeta, ladies and gentlemen, I would like to begin by thanking the Court of Auditors for presenting this annual report, our most important tool in the discharge procedure for the Commission’s budget. My sincere thanks for this transparent report, which I believe will do much to help us more forward.  This report makes it clear that for the 18th
 time in succession, there can only be a limited statement of assurance for the work of the Commission, and as Mr Pieper has already said, the trend towards an improving error rate year on year has stopped. This House abides by its demand, however: what we want to see is a clear trend towards an improving error rate in the implementation of the EU budget. We are not prepared to accept the present situation. The Court of Auditors’ annual report also sends out a clear message to the Council, however, which is meeting this evening in order to find a compromise for the multiannual financial framework. Poorly functioning management and control systems in the Member States, overdue financial corrections at a high level, unnecessarily complicated rules in the Member States: anyone who wants better spending and does not use this as camouflage for cuts can start here. Anyone who wants better spending must improve the controls in the Member States, not cut the budgets. Anyone who wants better spending must also do their homework in their own country, for in Germany, the Netherlands and the United Kingdom, the control systems, according to the Court of Auditors and the Commission, are only effective to a limited extent. What concerns us about budget management in 2011 is that in some areas of the budget, the figures have got worse, as Mr Pieper has already pointed out. In research policy, for example – an area of the budget that is, in fact, directly administered by the Commission – the error rate has doubled from 1.4 to 3 %. Here, we must demand a plan of action from the Commissioner for Research, setting out how the Commission intends to reduce these error rates. In the common agricultural policy, the error rate generally hovered around the materiality threshold of 2 %. Now, the Court of Auditors estimates the error rate in rural development to be an incredible 7.7 %, meaning that spending on rural development has by far the highest error rate of any area investigated.  We cannot be consoled by the explanation that the programmes in the Member States have now reached full maturity, or by the explanation that the number of development projects is also increasing, so the errors are rising as well. No, what we want to see here is a remedy, and the Directorate-General for Agriculture and Rural Development and Commissioner Cioloş should be resolute in their efforts to move Member States towards better controls, as has already been achieved in regional policy. This is a good example of how tackling the causes can have a positive effect. The figure of 6 % for erroneous payments as a proportion of the total is still too high but the trend is moving in the right direction. The action plan adopted in 2008 has done much to improve the situation by greatly increasing the Commission’s supervision of the national management and control systems. Commissioner Cioloş should therefore start by seeking ideas for his own action plan to reduce the growing error rates in agricultural policy as well. There is room for improvement in regional policy too. We want retrospective projects to be removed from funding at last. We want the Directorate-General for Regional Policy to take the same robust action as the Directorate-General for Employment by suspending and cancelling funding programmes if Member States cannot guarantee proper and lawful control, and we want net corrections: Member States should only be able to transfer funds to other projects if they themselves detect errors in project management. If they are unable to detect the errors themselves, as is so often the case, the funding should revert to the Commission. Jens Geier,  
deputising for the rapporteur.

 Madam President, I am standing in, today, for Ms Ayala Sender, who is in Algeria as part of an electoral observers’ delegation and is thus unable to act as rapporteur for discharge of the other institutions. Let me start with the good news: we intend to move that the majority of the other institutions should be discharged. We had difficulty with the granting of discharge to the Economic and Social Committee because, although various requirements of the European Parliament in relation to questions of travel expenses claims and similar problems that attract a great deal of interest in the media have been met, we are somewhat concerned to find that there have been some differences of opinion within the Committee in relation to certain decisions on appointments – I trust you will understand my wish to choose my words with care here. The rapporteur has expressed her concerns in relation to this issue at Committee level and we shall continue to monitor the situation. However, this will not prevent us from requesting discharge. In the case of the Council, the situation is slightly different. Firstly, I would like to express my satisfaction and pleasure to find that the Danish Council Presidency is doing us the honour of following this debate. This is a first in all my time as a Member of his House. This is an encouraging sign that we are moving away from the phase where the institutions simply ignored one another during debates. I will return to this point at the end of my remarks. Each year, we find ourselves in a situation reminiscent of ‘Groundhog Day’. In other words, we start the business of discharging the Council for its management of the budget, or at least for the portion that involves European Union resources – in other words, the general budget funds. We assess the documents and we ask pertinent questions. The Council never gives any answers, however. Instead, we have received an offer from the Council to negotiate an interinstitutional agreement. This is something to be welcomed from my point of view at least because I have a difficulty when I find the Secretaries-General of the two institutions negotiating with one another, despite the fact that they do not have a political mandate – please do not take this personally Mr Welle – because, in my opinion, they have failed to pay enough attention to the aspirations, wishes and positions of the responsible Committee. Thus, we have a proposal for an interinstitutional agreement on the table and the position of my group in this House is that we should put the opportunities offered by this interinstitutional agreement to the test. Unfortunately we are in the minority here, because most of my fellow Members believe that the documents describe the functions adequately. At this point, I would like to emphasise once again that the Group of the Progressive Alliance of Socialists and Democrats does not wish to reduce the rights and responsibilities of the discharge authority, but that it would like to see how far we can get with the Council if we follow the strategy of negotiating this interinstitutional agreement. The main problem is reciprocity, as the Council insists that it should be allowed to examine Parliament’s auditing process, adopting the same high-handed approach as it takes to answering our questions to the Council. One more thing, Madam President; the bottom line for Parliament is that we cannot accept a situation where civil servants from the Member States control the public representatives who express the will of the citizens of Europe. Everything else is open to negotiation, so perhaps we shall succeed in making a little progress today. Jens Geier  (S&amp;D

Madam President, Ms Andreasen has just asked the European taxpayer to stop paying money to Brussels because, supposedly, no one is interested in spending practices. Exactly the opposite is true. This House is extremely interested in the spending practices of the EU institutions and what happens with the European taxpayers’ money. The problem is that our conclusions are different from those of Ms Andreasen. The Group of the Progressive Alliance of Socialists and Democrats certainly comes to very different conclusions in relation to the situation of the European agencies. Let me give you a brief run-down based on the example of the European Medicines Agency (EMA). Thanks to the work of our rapporteur of last year, Mr Stavrakakis, the EMA now has the strictest ‘Conflict of interest’
 system in Europe. The rapporteur for the European People's Party (Christian Democrats) has come to the conclusion that this is not enough and suggests that the discharge should be deferred, arguing that this system must first prove itself. This is precisely the opposite of the burden of proof outlined by Ms Herczog in her contribution. Ms Macovei, if the effectiveness of this system is to be put to the test, then this is the job of the next rapporteur, Mr Gerbrandy from the Group of the Alliance of Liberals and Democrats for Europe. If we find that the system does not work, then we can fine-tune it. However, to insist that an agency should not be discharged until the system has proven itself is to turn the burden of proof on its head. At this point, I fail to understand your claim that you are not seeking to damage the agency. The damage has already been done. We simply need to take a look at how the media has reported on your report, questioning the independence of stakeholders or experts in the agencies. You have already inflicted the damage that you say you wanted to avoid. We do indeed have a problem. The problem is that we cannot find independent rapporteurs or experts because you will find it difficult to identify university lecturers who have not worked for industry in the past. It is also the function of the agencies to cooperate with the private sector. Perhaps we really do need absolute clarity in declarations, separation of responsibilities and regulations. This cannot be achieved by deferring the discharge, however, Ms Macovei. For this reason, we will not be supporting your report. Jens Geier  (S&amp;D

 Mr Bradbourn, I share many of the opinions you have expressed. I have one question for you, however, in light of the judgment of the European Court of Auditors that the United Kingdom is responsible for 10% of the errors in cohesion policy: what is the Conservative Party of Great Britain doing to eliminate this mismanagement by British administrative authorities? Jens Geier,  
rapporteur.
 – (DE)
 Mr President, Mr Ehrenhauser, that fits in very nicely inasmuch as I can answer your question straight away. It is quite clear to me that, at this juncture, it is not a question of refusing discharge. However, if the rapporteur for the discharge in respect of the agencies raises accusations against the agencies, some of which lie outside the responsibility of these institutions, because the staffing of certain bodies, which you rightly described as excessive, is the responsibility of the Member States, then in October, the only option will be to refuse discharge, because this situation will not have changed, because the Member States will not have altered their behaviour with regard to the agencies. Therefore, the political instrument is not the appropriate one. The Group of the Progressive Alliance of Socialists and Democrats in the European Parliament really is now the last not to take the conflicts of interest seriously. The case just mentioned by Commissioner Šemeta is one that once again throws some pertinent light on the situation. However, the problem will not be resolved by postponing discharge. In committee, I have repeatedly argued that, to resolve the issue, we must wait for the report from the European Court of Auditors, which President Caldeira has, thankfully, informed us about, in order to reach conclusions based on a more thorough knowledge of the facts, which we can then also discuss in a serious debate. I am on the point of making accusations about certain situations, such as the issue that you also mentioned concerning the choice of seats of the agencies. In a press statement, I myself have criticised the fact that the UK Government is forcing one agency to establish its offices in Canary Wharf. That is the most expensive property market that the European Union has to offer. This is the same government that is proposing that the EU make savings. It really must start with its own decisions. Thus, with regard to the question of whether the criticism is justified, there is far less disagreement than there perhaps appears to be. The arguments relate to the question of what the political response to this should be. Jens Geier,

 Madam President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, are there 111 774 or 125 218 officers serving in Afghanistan’s national police force? This question remains to be answered. That is one of the problems that we encounter when we examine the issue of the use of EU aid in Afghanistan. This question is not inconsequential, as the salaries of the Afghan police officers are paid through the Law and Order Trust Fund for Afghanistan (LOTFA), which was set up by the United Nations Development Programme. LOTFA is the largest recipient of financial aid in Afghanistan. We do not know how many police officers there are because the databases of the Afghan police force are unreliable. Up to now, the European Union has provided funds to Afghanistan via three different channels. There is the use of private contracting partners which fulfil contracts issued by the European Commission. There are non-governmental organisations and there are the multi-donor trust funds, the largest being maintained by the United Nations, and there is another important one that was set up by the World Bank for the development of Afghanistan. These are the channels through which the European Union’s projects in Afghanistan, which must meet a number of criteria, are financed. They are to ensure the visibility of the European Union in Afghanistan. They are to support capacity building in the public administration. They must not be vulnerable to corruption. They must be sustainable. They are to be aligned with the regional priorities, but also with the priorities of the government. If we examine the strengths and weaknesses of the channels through which we transfer funds to Afghanistan, then we see that not all of the criteria can be met via any one channel, but that each of the different channels that the European Union uses to transfer funds to Afghanistan has its own particular strengths, but also its own particular risks. Two of the important objectives, namely, capacity building in the public administration and alignment with the priorities of the government, cannot be met at all via the channels used up to now. In my report, I therefore propose that we use a fourth channel, one that is now used for Afghanistan by many donors in the international community although not as yet by the European Union, and that is the channel of direct budget support to the Afghan state. This direct support to the Afghan budget brings with it a number of problems. One of these became very clear in media reports when it was found that cash – dollars in this case – was immediately being taken out of Afghanistan by the box-load, and I am pleased to be able to say at this point that, if these boxes contained any European funds at all, it would have only been a very small amount. With their direct budget support, the Americans had to learn a very expensive lesson in using this channel. However, they have learnt that lesson. They are proceeding step by step. They are taking it department by department of the Afghan ministries and ensuring that certain criteria are met, namely, that management and control systems are employed, that there are mechanisms for combating corruption in place, and that accountability to the Afghan Parliament is ensured. I believe that if the European Commission were to follow the same path, that is to say, take a step-wise approach, set clear goals for the Afghan Government that are retrievable and possible to monitor, ensure that there is accountability to the Afghan Parliament and – I believe this is very important – a truly independent Afghan court of auditors, then we can also support the use of this channel. After the withdrawal of the military, there will be a greater need for civilian aid. We must therefore ensure that this aid functions in a targeted, effective and sustainable way and that the funds provided by the European Union are protected against corruption and waste. That is in the best interests not only of European taxpayers, but of Afghanistan, too. Jens Geier,  
on behalf of the S&amp;D Group.

 Mr President, Mr Caldeira, Mr Šemeta, ladies and gentlemen, the overall error rate for spending from the EU budget was 3.7%. This figure is too high. A resolution by this House based on the Liberadzki report calls for this figure to be constantly reduced. I am concerned that the Court of Auditors’ annual report for the financial year 2010 shows that the trend is being reversed. After three years of falling error rates, the figure is now increasing again. Unfortunately, European regional policy is once again responsible, because the error rate in this area rose from 5.5 to 7.7%. Interestingly, information from the European Commission shows that the United Kingdom is in third place behind Spain and Italy in the list of states where the most errors take place. We know that errors are being made because of divided management in the Member States and we know which Member States are responsible. Therefore, we are calling on the Commission to focus on monitoring activities in these countries. The Commission must suspend or interrupt the programmes, but the error rate must come down. If we look at revenue, it is clear that one eighth of the European budget is made up of income from external tariffs. The Member States are also failing to fulfil their obligations in this area. Duties are not being levied efficiently and once again Italy and the United Kingdom, together with the Netherlands, are the main culprits. I would like to thank the European Court of Auditors, you, Mr Caldeira and all your staff for this important document, which we will make detailed use of in the forthcoming discharge procedure.

 Mr President, President-in-Office of the Council, Commissioner Lewandowski, ladies and gentlemen, it is of course also appropriate at this point for we shadow rapporteurs to express our thanks and appreciation to the two rapporteurs from this House. They delved so deeply into the subject that sometimes we could no longer see them. My compliments on this splendid work. In connection with the Financial Regulation, we are also discussing Article 56, which deals with shared management. In the European Union, that is particularly important in regional policy and represents the second largest budget area. It represents the acid test for whether the Member States really are serious about the prudent use of EU funds, about which we have heard so much in the budget debates this morning. We see that, since 1994, there has been a total of more than EUR 7 billion in financial corrections in this area. We also see that, in 2010 alone, there was more than EUR 250 million in repayments to the EU budget – funds that were misspent in the Member States. At this point, I would like once again to recall the fact that EUR 250 million is more than the European Parliament wants to mobilise by means of the Flexibility Instrument. All I can say, Mr Dominik, is that when you next visit in the Council, please convey a message from the Committee on Budgets: we want our money back! What has been proposed in terms of audits and better control procedures in the Financial Regulation within the framework of Article 56 will help in this regard. I will be interested to see how the Council responds to this. Jens Geier,  
on behalf of the S&amp;D Group.

 Madam President, Mr Dominik, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, the question of discharge for the Council has been an institutional bone of contention between Parliament and the Council for years. According to our interpretation, the process is governed by Article 319 of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union, which governs the discharge of the Commission’s budget, and the corresponding article in the Financial Regulation. So far, the Council has not been in agreement with this view. It presently argues that, as it uses operational funding from the Commission’s budget, it is also discharged along with the Commission’s budget. I do not wish to repeat the statements and positions that I and the other members of the Committee on Budgetary Control have heard from the Council in this connection. All I would say is that there have been many of them and, in my view, they have not always been coherent. I think it is an important development that the Council is now ready to negotiate at a political level, rather than at the level of the Secretaries-General – who I do not believe have sufficient political mandate for this – as it informed us by means of a letter following the Committee on Budgetary Control’s decision on the granting of discharge to the Council. I would like to express my sincere thanks to the Presidency of the Council for this new offer. I take the view that we should take up this offer of negotiations with the highest-ranking negotiating delegation we can muster. I also believe that we should not go into the negotiations with predetermined ideas. I therefore recommended to my group that we should abstain at this point.

 Mr Søndergaard, I am happy to give you the answer to this, which is that these are simply rumours. At this point, I could simply fall back on the position of not commenting on rumours. However, I have just presented our group’s position, namely, that we are going to abstain at this juncture in order to enable negotiations to take place with the Council on a level not encumbered with predetermined ideas. We acted in a similar way when it came to your discharge report for the Council. Jens Geier  (S&amp;D
).

 Mr President, I would like to issue an explanation of vote on behalf of the Group of the Progressive Alliance of Socialists and Democrats in the European Parliament. The question of the granting of discharge for the Council by the European Parliament has been an institutional bone of contention for years. The Council and Parliament have not yet managed to resolve this issue amicably. The European Parliament bases its argument for its right to grant discharge on Article 319 of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union, and the corresponding articles in the Financial Regulation. It goes without saying that the S&amp;D Group shares this position. We insist on Parliament’s right to monitor and evaluate the proper use of taxpayers’ money by the Council. So far, the Council has not been in agreement with this view. At present, the Council argues that it is granted discharge along with the Commission budget. The S&amp;D Group does not share this view. We want to see a clear and balanced procedure that has been negotiated with the Council and that sets out the rights and obligations of the institutions. We are convinced that we should take the negotiated route first. This is because the non-granting of discharge to the Council will have no impact, as the EU Treaty does not provide for any consequences for such an occurrence. However, since the non-granting of discharge remains legally without consequence, the S&amp;D Group decided to abstain. Jens Geier,  
rapporteur for the opinion of the Committee on Regional Development

 Madam President, I would like to use a minute now as rapporteur for the opinion of the Committee on Regional Development and then speak for two minutes later in the debate on behalf of my group. Madam President, Mr Becsey, Commissioner Šemeta, President Caldeira, ladies and gentlemen, the regional policy budget remains the Achilles heel of the European Union general budget. Five percent of payments from the European Regional Fund still have errors and must therefore be described as irregular payments. Even some of the payments that appear to be correct are actually supporting grotesque projects. May I remind you that an Elton John concert in Naples was subsidised by the European Regional Fund. It was said to be a measure to promote tourism. That might be the case, but in my opinion real regional aid for Naples should take a different form. The reason for this is that all too often the Member States still consider funding from the European Regional Fund to be soft money. This is obvious from the fact that there is a backlog of repayments due from irregular payments, from the fact that very often the Commission has to use the instrument of suspending payments – something that, as budget controllers, we expressly welcome – and from the fact that the punctuality of reporting suffers. The Director General for Regional Policy cannot provide us with any assurance as to the legality and reliability of over half the operational programmes because the reporting by the Member States is inadequate. Ladies and gentlemen, we still have a lot to do here. Jens Geier  (S&amp;D
).

 Mr President, I would like to thank Mr Ulmer for his noticeably factual contribution. It makes a pleasant contrast to many of the things that I have heard said about the agencies this morning. It is extremely depressing that many of the Members from the Eurosceptic parts of this House can never think of anything else but the agencies when it comes to budget cuts. May I remind you that when these agencies were allocated it seemed that the prime ministers and governments of the Member States of the European Union could not get enough of these agencies on their soil. Yet now people are acting as if they are the scourge of the European Union. I am very pleased at the announcement of a study by the European Court of Auditors into the management costs of the agencies. I believe it will provide us with a basis to at last have a more objective debate. I am delighted – as I said previously in my first contribution – that the representatives of the Hungarian Presidency are here with us this morning. That is not something we can take for granted when there is a debate that includes the discharge of the Council. I would therefore like to address you directly, Mr Becsey. I am pleased that the Council is prepared to recognise – as I took from the comments made by Mr Deutsch – that the budget proceedings and the discharge procedure must be dealt with differently. This European Parliament is the people’s representation and it demands accountability for the use of taxpayers’ money. We will therefore not shirk from demanding that the Council be held accountable for the money given to the Council from the Community budget to finance its work. Of course, there is plenty that we could negotiate on, such as what form the discharge procedure should take in the future. However, I should like to ask you whether you seriously expect the European Parliament to negotiate on something that is our right under the treaties. After all, that could only result in this right being restricted. I fail to see why I, as a Member of the European Parliament, would do that. Unfortunately, we do not have many opportunities to discuss things together and I would be delighted if you would take this opportunity to make it clear to us for once who it is in the Council that is actually fighting against the necessary transparency. Jens Geier  (S&amp;D

 Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, when I listen to the debate on the House of European History, it seems to me that there are only two types of Members in this House: the budget specialists, who attend this debate and who are largely critical of this project, and everybody else, who seem to find the whole thing to be just fine. The worst thing here is that when it comes to the issue of the House of European History there are so many cooks that people have actually lost sight of the point of the whole exercise. Thus, the Daily Telegraph today reported that documents have come into its possession indicating that the cost of this project has risen to the astronomical figure of GBP 137 million. I can only invite the Daily Telegraph to forward these documents to the Committee on Budgets and to let us see from it some of the transparency that the press demands from the Members of this House. I would welcome an opportunity to examine the evidence. Does this project make sense? Naturally it makes sense to foster an awareness of what the European Union and European integration have meant for people’s lives. Should a parliament operate a museum? No, definitely not. That is why the Group of the Progressive Alliance of Socialists and Democrats in the European Parliament have followed two guiding principles on this project. The first is: we demand that the project should have a business plan. The second is: we want clarity on the follow-up costs, that is, how this project is to be funded going forward. We might add a third principle: we should avoid any duplications or overlaps between the Infocentre and the House of European History. Jens Geier,

 Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, Commissioner Šemeta, We know that 80% of the EU budget is administered in a shared management arrangement, which means that money is administered and spent in the Member States, which is exactly where the errors, irregularities and fraud occur. The annual report on the protection of the European Union’s financial interests is a bit like the Member States’ list of sins, which is why I would like to thank Mr Cătălin Sorin and the shadow rapporteurs from the other groups for their hard work. I found the Commission’s report on the protection of the European Union’s financial interests contains one remarkable sentence – on page 11 in the German version. It reads: ‘For the Objective 2 programmes, the very high irregularity rates of the UK and the Netherlands, which mainly benefit from this type of programmes, may have influenced the overall rate.’ The United Kingdom and the Netherlands are two of the countries that have proposed cutting the European budget. From my position I can only call on them to make sure that European taxpayers’ money is spent correctly and to combat the level of irregularities in their countries. I would be very interested to hear whether you have anything else to add in this context, Commissioner. Jens Geier  (S&amp;D

Madam President, Commissioner Lewandowski, ladies and gentlemen, this morning we are debating the need to make savings in view of the debt crisis that we are experiencing in the Member States. Mrs Trüpel and others have quite rightly pointed out that this debt crisis affects us only indirectly, as it is not permitted for debts to be incurred at European level. Yet how can we pursue an austerity policy in the European Union if the volume of European expenditure is only 2% of the total public expenditure of all 27 Member States? I believe that this is not an austerity policy at all. Instead, it is a question of symbols – symbols that are in some way passed to us by the Member States as if money that is transferred to Brussels for the European budget in effect disappears into a deep black hole. This completely ignores the fact that the funds that go into the European budget actually go back to the Member States again. Of course, they do not go back at a ratio of 1:1, as Europe is not a savings bank, and we naturally pursue a policy of solidarity where we support those in the European Union that are less well developed. For example, in my state of North Rhine-Westphalia in Germany, all of the labour market instruments that are now implemented there are cofinanced by the European Social Fund. If we remove this funding, there will be correspondingly less labour market policy. That cannot be what Social Democrats are aiming for. Let us consider for a moment how the Member States spend European funds. The Court of Auditors’ annual report states that there are deficiencies in the way the management and control systems for spending European funds operate. It states that the recovery of wrongly invested funds in the Member States runs into billions of euro. It also states that the Commission is now, thankfully, going to suspend payments in cases where European programmes are being mismanaged. That is also happening for example in Germany and the United Kingdom. The Council, which is not here, represents the Member States, which I urgently call on to improve their management of EU budgetary resources. The increase in efficiency that this would make possible would allow us to considerably improve the way we spend EU funds – not by spending more money but by improving the way we spend it. The Member States can play a part in this in order to underline their willingness to make savings. Jens Geier  (S&amp;D
).

 Madam President, Mr Lewandowski, ladies and gentlemen, naturally, we should discuss the costs that are to be avoided or saved in this budget. However, I would call on you all to be a little more objective in your knee-jerk responses to the discussion in relation to the agencies. Why is this? Firstly, because the Committee on Budgetary Control is permanently engaged in this debate and also draws attention to ways in which cooperation between the agencies and the performance of their duties can be improved, and also because we are expecting a special report on the agencies this year from the European Court of Auditors and will then have a more objective basis for what is, at present, a somewhat ill-considered discussion, particularly with regard to the question of how the agencies are managed and how we may be able to achieve these savings. Speaking of savings, I would like to come to my next topic, our building policy. The fact is that when it comes to the buildings of the European Union, we can certainly save resources. Speaking personally, I would question whether it is really a good idea to build new buildings for the European Parliament in Brussels because this strategy really only makes sense if real estate prices in Brussels continuously rise. At present, the market would not seem to support this. If real estate prices on the market do not rise, then the option of renting rather than buying really does make sense, particularly when you walk around the European quarter with your eyes open and see how much office space is actually available to rent in the area. Which brings me to the issue of the House of European History. I believe that greater legitimacy is required here because it is not enough that to date, all the initiatives for the establishment of the House of European History are simply based on resolutions by the Bureau of this House and have no democratic legitimacy. This needs to change. Above all, we need to know how the operating costs and follow-up costs of this institution are to be covered. Jens Geier  (S&amp;D

 Mr President, Commissioner Barnier, ladies and gentlemen, we all know that the European Union does not have the best reputation. This often results from the fact that workers do not feel that the balance between freedom and security is protected or that it needs to be restored in many areas. This can be seen, for example, in the Services Directive, since it is an important driver of the internal market but also throws a spotlight on the limitations of that market at the same time. The review is therefore important. It is a complex task, and one to which Mrs Gebhardt has provided absolutely outstanding answers. There are still some challenges to be overcome, however. The Services Directive must not, under any circumstances, undermine the fundamental principle of equal pay for equal work in the same location. We must therefore carefully ensure, through all the monitoring opportunities that have been made available to us, that cross-border services, too, do not violate this principle. The point of single contact must provide fair access to the market of the country in which the service is to be provided. However, this is not only for the service providers themselves and the companies, for whom in my home city of Essen, for example, there are six officials – for four towns – who feel responsible. It is also for the workers. In that regard, it is absolutely crucial what language these points of single contact speak. In the Committee on Regional Development, we had a fairly hopeless discussion on this. In my view, the languages of the neighbouring countries should be used. Jens Geier  (S&amp;D

 Madam President, Mr Almunia, ladies and gentlemen, I would like to refer briefly to two points. One of them concerns competitiveness, which is raised in a number of different areas of the report. I would like to ask you to remember how many mining accidents we hear about in the media. This is due to the fact that mining and, in particular, coal mining is going on all over the world, but unfortunately, the safety standards elsewhere are very low when compared with those in German or other European pits. This may seem like overstating the case, but personally, I do not think much of competitiveness which is bought at the expense of miners’ lives. However, if we are looking at the consequences for industrial policy of an early exit from coal mining, I would like to say that the European mining equipment industry is competitive. I would like to invite all those people who believe that mining is an industry of the past and, in particular, Mr Klinz, to pay a visit to a mine. They will soon realise that mining uses high-tech solutions and that it is a question of whether or not we want this industry to continue to be profitable. I know that this is not what the Group of the Alliance of Liberals and Democrats for Europe wants. I am afraid that the mining machinery industry will follow mining production and move out of Europe. Jens Geier  (S&amp;D

Madam President, I would like to ask Mr van Dalen whether he is aware that the high percentages refer only to the percentage of the sample. In other words, it is not 36% of the payments that are in error, but 36% of the payments in the sample. If this is extrapolated up, the result is at least 5% in the case of the Cohesion Fund. Therefore, the billions that you referred to are not accurate amounts. Were you aware of this? Jens Geier  (S&amp;D
). 
 – (DE)
 Madam President, Mr Caldeira, Mr Šemeta, cohesion policy is the sick man of the EU budget. Last year, he was in intensive care and this year he is convalescing. However, he is far from making a full recovery and he could have a relapse at any time. More than 5% of all the cohesion policy payments were in error and 3% should not have been made at all. This amounts to around EUR 700 million. A large proportion of these erroneous payments could have been prevented by the Member States. The errors are occurring in public procurement and in the payment of cohesion funding, despite the existing control systems, which have been approved by the Commission. We need to take another careful look at these control systems. In my home country of Germany, the samples showed that all the control systems there which had been tested were only partially effective. The responsibility for managing the budget lies with the Commission. We can discuss this contradiction – errors in the Member States which are the responsibility of the Commission – in our home countries, we can explain it to the media and we can tell our citizens about it. However, in political terms, it is the job of the Commission to resolve this problem in the Member States. Mr Šemeta, you need to take control in this area and you will have our support for doing so.

Madam President, Mr Oettinger, as rapporteur for the opinion of the Committee on Budgets concerning Mrs Van Brempt’s report, I can say that the members of the committee very much welcomed this report. We have looked at it not only from a budgetary perspective, but also, to certain extent, with regard to its content and we have raised one concern, which Mrs Van Brempt was kind enough to include. This instrument is aimed at municipalities and rightly so, because this is where the greatest increases in efficiency can be achieved. However, I come from an area of Germany where the municipalities cannot take out any additional loans, because they are already too heavily in debt. This may be a problem specific to Germany, because of our local authority constitutions, but Mr Oettinger, as a former head of a Federal German state, will be only too familiar with this subject. Therefore, in Germany, we are in a position where those local authorities which should be making use of this programme are not allowed to, because the body responsible for supervising them has prevented them from taking on any further debt. We are very concerned about this. It could result in this programme being ineffective in these areas. We welcome this programme and would be pleased if it could be continued. We have called for the programme to have a separate budget line and we would like to transfer to it the EUR 15 million available in the agricultural policy area which cannot be accessed there because there is no legal basis for doing so. This is where the budget needs to be more flexible. Jens Geier  (S&amp;D

 – (DE)
 Madam President, Mr Wathelet, Commissioner, I believe that we are all agreed, even the gentlemen and the few ladies among the Eurosceptic to anti-Europe fractions of this House, that the EU performs important tasks and that the performance of these tasks represents European added value, because the nation states either cannot perform them or the final beneficiaries would not receive this money from the nation states. The latter scenario is due, in particular, to the fact that the Member States would not invest savings, but would have to use them to reduce debt, whereas the European budget is largely an investor. Thus, if we want to achieve the goals that are set here every week, we need an ambitious budget, and that means not less money, but more money in future. In this connection, I believe it is important to emphasise that the national budgets and the European budget are complementary to one another. The Council and the Member States behave as if money that goes into the European budget more or less disappears into a large black hole. That is not the case; it is invested in goals that we have previously agreed on here. We therefore also need, as Mr Böge proposes, a critical examination of the medium-term financial programme. This, of course, can only serve to show that the Council cannot say ‘yes’ to the Treaty of Lisbon while, at the same time, putting forward one or other project for financing and then saying: but you will not get any money for its implementation. If it is not possible, then we will resort to the necessary deletions of the budget lines that Parliament does not regard as priorities. Ladies and gentlemen, we will have this discussion again and again while the EU does not have sufficient funds of its own. What is important – no, essential – is that these own resources do not impose an additional burden on normal wage earners. As a Social Democrat, I am in favour of the introduction of a financial transaction tax, because in general, this will not affect normal wage earners and it will help to put the brakes on the financial market. We firmly believe that those who triggered a crisis, the like of which we have never seen before, and the costs of which we all have to pay out of the public budgets of our own Member States, should be called on to compensate for these losses.

 Mr President, Mr Barroso, Mr Zapatero, from the point of view of those in charge of budgetary control in this House, the Spanish Presidency has made history. We are grateful that this Presidency has succeeded in removing the discharge procedure for the Council from the sphere of obscurity. Previously, the Council has refused to lay adequate accounts before the European Parliament. Sessions had, at best, an informal character. One had to collect documents bit by bit, or they were unavailable. Answers to questions were unsatisfactory. The Council would refer in all seriousness to an agreement dating from 1970, the ‘gentlemen’s agreement’, which allegedly clarifies issues concerning the discharge, although this gentlemen’s agreement spares not a single word on this matter. This has now changed. The Secretary-General of the Council has agreed to introduce a discharge procedure worthy of the name in a transparent procedure in compliance with democratic standards. This success of the Spanish Presidency testifies to the democratic and European convictions of the Spanish Government. For this, it deserves the praise of this House. Jens Geier  (S&amp;D

 Mr President, Mr Maystadt, Mr Rehn, I would first like to thank Mr Deutsch for his work. However, I would also like to take the opportunity to emphasise the importance of the European Investment Bank (EIB) for Europe and for the citizens of Europe and to highlight the fact that we must make greater use of this unique institution, in particular in times of economic crisis. From the perspective of budgetary control, which in modern terms also covers the actual output and performance of European programmes and institutions, the EIB has definitely earned its high rating, in particular with regard to political reliability. It creates real added value for the people of Europe by means of the investments made in its six main programmes, ranging from the Trans-European Networks to supporting small and medium-sized enterprises, and its special programmes, such as the project to combat climate change. I am sure that this will receive broad support in the European Parliament. However, this also means that Parliament must in future extend its own supervisory procedures. I am referring here, for example, to the investment facility. Finally, I would like to make one further point which is particularly important to my group and which is aimed directly at the EIB. We welcome the fact that the EIB has revised its policy on offshore financial centres. However, we also need the assurance that income produced from EIB funds will not make its way into tax havens of this kind, otherwise the EIB would risk damaging the reputation and the rating that it has built up.

Good morning Mr President, ladies and gentlemen. I would like to repeat that, in my opinion, it is rather difficult to conduct a debate in the absence of those to whom we are supposed to grant discharge, with whom we want to discuss the reasons why we are granting discharge or are postponing discharge or whatever else we have to talk to them about. I know many of the honourable Members of this House from the committee. We also know our respective positions. It is fine that we will exchange them once again this morning, but it is not really helpful. In this context, I would like to propose that in committee, we deliberate formally inviting the institutions we are discussing to the next discharge debate and postponing the debates accordingly if they are not present. Discharge to the European institutions comes at a difficult, but important moment. A consequence of the financial crisis is that all governments are having to review their respective budgets and ensure that they are meeting their requirements. We are in the first year of a new legislative period of the European Parliament and are dealing with a newly assembled Commission. In terms of the discharge, we are, however, considering the 2008 budget, which was under the responsibility of the previous Commission. This opens a multitude of new perspectives. Among these new perspectives, we should expect a new way of thinking and a new approach on the part of the Member States since, for the first time, the Treaty of Lisbon names them as being co-responsible for the implementation of the EU budget. In terms of the 2008 budgetary review, it was the rapporteur’s intention to ensure that the Commission concentrates entirely on possibilities for improvement in budgetary control and that the Member States are on board for that as well. As the Group of the Progressive Alliance of Socialists and Democrats in the Committee on Budgetary Control, it is our goal that in future, every discharge report – on the basis of the judgment of the European Court of Auditors – is better than the previous one. It all depends on the Council assuming its new key roll in the light of the importance of the Member States. It would be equally helpful if the European Court of Auditors looked for ways of redressing the imbalance that is, on the one hand, the result of annual reporting and the multiannual duration of many EU programmes and the logic of their implementation by the Commission and the Member States. As the budgetary authority, we continue to have great concerns regarding some specific areas of responsibility, and, in particular, those in which the EU intends to implement its political priorities. For example, cohesion in the European Union is essential and therefore, the funds that flow into structural policy are particularly important. Here, we need to continue combating sources of errors decisively through simpler rules and recovering funds wrongly paid. We need finer instruments to measure results and we call on the Court of Auditors to develop these instruments, in order to be able to identify precisely the sources of errors. We know that the action plan for the structural funds that provides for recovery is finally being implemented and we must now wait for it to have an effect. Pre-accession aid has the goal of enabling fundamental processes of change in these states and problems in target setting and implementation must be remedied. What will not do, however, is the fact that the goal of the accession process is effectively being torpedoed through the back door. Therefore, I call on the House to reject the attempt by the Group of the European People’s Party (Christian Democrats) to use amendments to turn the position of the European Parliament on Turkey’s accession process on its head, as recorded in the resolution on the progress report. We are looking forward to the appointment of a new Director-General of the European Antifraud Office (OLAF) to end the ongoing debate, and also the Commission’s proposals on the reform of OLAF, in order to improve the crucial work of this office. Finally, to external policy actions. We need a demonstration of the determination of the EU to contribute to the resolution of problems worldwide. These actions must be highly effective, even under the most difficult circumstances. In the coming months, we must discuss the current management of EU funds in this area with the Commission and how these funds will be managed in future by the European External Action Service. We are, however, making some progress. Our group is particularly pleased with the steps the Commission is taking as regards the annual management reports of the Member States, for example, since we are thereby getting closer to the realisation of an old demand of the Group of the Progressive Alliance of Socialists and Democrats. The same is true for the financial corrections and recoveries, since this is also an opportunity to reduce an unacceptably high rate of errors. These points give us, among other things, the opportunity, some considerations notwithstanding, to call for the discharge of the Commission. I thank you and look forward to your comments. Jens Geier  (S&amp;D

Mr President, Commissioner, Mr López Garrido, I am delighted that you are here and so demonstrate the Council’s recognition of this important debate. Ladies and gentlemen, we all know this little trick: if you want to embarrass someone, ask them a question with a wording like, do you still actually smack your children? Even if the person says no, they have implicitly admitted that in the past, they did smack their children. The discharge report for Parliament by Mr Staes, who I would like to thank for his work, is a critical report, and to me, in some areas at least, it has followed this logic. Self-criticism is good, but it should then be accurate. I have had many discussions in my group on how we might reject this or that wording in the report on Parliament’s discharge. Some of us have come under more than a little pressure in our home countries regarding this. However, I do want to convey to you my answers to these questions as to why we have rejected some wording or other in the report on Parliament’s discharge. There are proposals that are already a reality. We could re-table them, but why? There are proposals that are not helpful, such as the idea of making the Committee on Budgetary Control a sort of alternative internal audit authority or an intermediary between the Bureau and plenary. There are many good proposals in this report that were, however, all adopted. Then there are proposals in this report that only represent a partial reality, as, for example, in Amendment 26 now on the table. This amendment demands the establishing of an internal control system in groups of this House. Nothing should be more obvious. In the Group of the Progressive Alliance of Socialists and Democrats, however, this has long been a reality, precisely for that reason. If my group were to agree to this, we would be acting as if we had some catching up to do. Therefore, we can, in this example, only agree if this reality is also illustrated in the report. I therefore propose adding the following phrase to this paragraph: as it is the fact in the S&amp;D Group. Jens Geier,

Mr President, so that the Minutes are correct, I represent rapporteur Bogusław Liberadzki, who, like many others in this House, has been a victim of the transport problems this week. I am very happy to do so and would like to use the opportunity to go over a few of the remarks made during the debate. For a start, Commissioner Šemeta, to my great satisfaction, you have stressed that the Commission will take steps to further strengthen the accountability of the leading actors in the management of EU funds. We all know what that means. Indeed, we all know that it means that we must remind the Member States of the European Union that manage a large portion of European funds of their responsibility to do so in accordance with good practice, because we also all know that the majority of the errors that are made in the utilisation of European funds are made by the Member States and at this level. That is why it is also rather unsatisfactory to hear colleagues from the European Conservatives and Reformists Group and the Europe of Freedom and Democracy Group, all of whom, including Mr Czarnecki, have other commitments, strongly criticising the Commission in the debate and saying that the Commission will be refused discharge. I would have expected my fellow Members to support pushing for national management statements in this House and also in the Member States, because that is where mistakes are being made and there is insufficient cooperation. Then it is rather unsatisfactory to hear colleagues from the ECR Group say that everything that happens here is substandard – knowing quite well that responsibility lies somewhere else entirely. Once again, I would like to mention pre-accession aid, because I feel that a few things have to be put right there. I would like to remind you that the Committee on Budgetary Control supported the rapporteur with a slight majority. I would also like to remind you that during the reporting, the representative of the European Court of Auditors sought to remind the rapporteur that his report was about the behaviour of the Commission as regards what was deemed to be worthy of criticism, not about the behaviour of Turkey. Our fellow Members in the Group of the European People’s Party (Christian Democrats) have voted amendments into the discharge of the Commission that we would like to remove straightaway, because here it is obviously less about the utilisation of taxpayers’ money and more about the question of where accession negotiations with Turkey are going. Deciding that at this point is the wrong way to go. Jens Geier  (S&amp;D

 Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, I would like to draw the attention of the European Commission and of this House to the worrying developments with regard to the prices of raw materials. Duisburg, home of the largest steelworks in Europe, is in my constituency. Here, and in the other steel-producing locations in the EU, the employees are very concerned about their jobs because the three large suppliers of iron ore are forcing price increases of 100% on the steel industry. In future, the price of ore is to be traded on the London Metal Exchange instead of price security being ensured, as was previously the case, by means of long-term supply contracts. The workforce and its trade unions fear that this will result in an extreme rise in the price of the base material, steel. This comes at a time when the potential areas for savings by means of cost-cutting programmes and reductions in the workforce, particularly after the most recent restructuring in the steel industry, have been completely exhausted. In order to draw attention to this situation, works councils and Germany’s Industrial Union of Metalworkers have directed an appeal on behalf of Duisburg to Chancellor Merkel and to President Barroso. I would ask the Commission to respond to this appeal. Jens Geier  (S&amp;D
).

 Mr President, Mr Kallas, Mr Caldeira, ladies and gentlemen, firstly I would like to thank you, Mr Caldeira, for your introduction and I would like to thank you and the members of the Court of Auditors for your report. Parliament will investigate carefully the information you have provided and will act on it in the coming months. I was pleased that the previously unacceptable error rate of the common agricultural policy has fallen. However, after reading the Court of Auditors’ report, I have the impression that one Member State, namely Romania, is responsible for the majority of the remaining irregularities. It seems that we must put more emphasis in future on training staff and implementing control systems correctly in the new Member States, if possible, before their accession. The European Structural Funds, which many of my fellow Members have already mentioned, represent another cause for concern. It is true that the number of irregular payments has fallen when compared with the previous year, but there are still huge problems in ensuring that aid funding is handled without irregularities occurring. I would like to say to the Eurosceptic parts of this House that we are talking about 11% of the total payments and not 11% of the budget. This amounts to EUR 2.7 billion and not EUR 5 billion. I admit that this is still EUR 2.7 billion too much, but we must be accurate for the sake of honesty. These irregularities relate mainly to excessive payments and the incorrect use of funds. For example, if European Social Fund (ESF) money is used to pay the salary of a public administrator or if European Regional Development Fund (ERDF) money is used to buy a building plot, then the people concerned obviously do not have sufficient information about the correct use of aid funding or the Member States do not have the will or the ability to administer the funding correctly, or perhaps all of the above. When we revise the application procedure, we must put in place clear, transparent rules which are easier to understand. The Member States must ensure that the applications are monitored more carefully at a national level. It is clear that any waste or any irregularities in relation to European taxpayers’ money is too much. However, anybody who takes an impartial look at the EU and at this report from the European Court of Auditors will find little cause for offence. It offers a number of starting points for our work, which consists of making Europe better and more efficient every day. On this basis we will implement the discharge procedure for the European Commission. Jens Geier  (S&amp;D
). 
 – (DE)
 Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I, too, would like to thank Mr Søndergaard for his successful work, as a result of which the Council ultimately accommodated Parliament in the discharge procedure. The Council refused, for a long while, to provide pertinent answers to Parliament’s questions, citing the Gentlemen’s Agreement – an agreement of an informal nature which is now, in any case, 40 years old. This seems downright bizarre when Council officials, after 40 years, clearly no longer know what exactly the Gentlemen’s Agreement states, since the version provided by the European Parliament contains precisely the opposite of what the Council claimed again and again in the negotiations. The first resolution of the Gentleman’s Agreement stated that the Council would not attempt to make any changes to the European Parliament’s expenditure. The third resolution states that there should be close cooperation between the two institutions on budget issues. The Council takes this to mean that each institution will leave the budgetary activity of the other alone. At this point, I will refrain from commenting on the seriousness of this line of argument. Instead, I would like to thank the Swedish Presidency of the Council for having begun the process of bringing an end to this ignoble state of affairs. The solution is an addendum to the interinstitutional agreement that clearly regulates the procedure for the granting of discharge to the Council by Parliament, as the proposed motion for a resolution demands. I therefore ask the House to support the motion. Jo Leinen  (S&amp;D

After 30 years of civil war there was a lot of chaos in Sri Lanka and colleagues have said that there are improvements but not enough. But you are speaking about a balanced resolution and you are calling for a comprehensive investigation by March 2014 – that is three months from now. Do you think that is realistic? Why do you impose such an ultimatum, rather than stating ‘in due time’, as you yourself said? March 2014 is completely unrealistic – do you not agree? Jo Leinen,

 Mr President, I am a member of Parliament’s delegation to India, and I love the people and the country. But, like all of us, I was shocked by the atrocity of this gang rape against a young student. Sexual violence against women is, unfortunately, a widespread phenomenon in India, especially in the capital, Delhi. The rape of this young girl is only the tip of the iceberg.  In our resolution we ask the Indian Government to investigate the cases of persons occupying senior official posts – up to the top levels of the Parliament and the government – against whom formal accusations of rape are outstanding, and call for those persons to give up their public functions. We call upon the Indian authorities to take effective measures to train police forces to handle rape cases better, and we call for the Indian criminal law to be amended to punish all forms of sexual assault. The European Union and the Member States should work with Indian authorities on special campaigns and programmes to combat gender-based violence. More has to be done to protect women and to implement Article 51 of the Indian Constitution, which forbids any practice against the dignity of women. Parliament’s delegation visits India in early May, and I am sure we will address this issue with our partners in the Indian Parliament. Jo Leinen  (S&amp;D

 Mr President, Mr Potočnik, in view of the enormous challenges facing nature and the environment, as well as the planet’s ecosystems, it must be admitted that the Rio conference is a missed opportunity. I see the glass as half empty rather than half full because the world continues to be ravaged and we have still failed to identify sufficient specific objectives and schedules or concrete obligations to enable us to change course in favour of sustainable development. The shift in power evident in Rio has been remarkable. It is interesting that an emerging economy like Brazil, supported by China and India, should present a document without there being the opportunity to change it. I would have liked to have seen more courage from Europe – acting together with the African Union perhaps – in support of the United Nations Environment Programme (UNEP), exerting more pressure so that the UNEP would become a UN organisation. What happens next? Of course we have our hopes. I believe that hopes spring from the grass roots: green cities and green business. The Rio conference hosted more mayors and more CEOs than any previous environmental summit. We should identify the urban environment as a focus area in the seventh EU Environmental Action Programme. The majority of people now live in cities, which is where the greatest amount of energy and most resources are consumed, providing a good starting point. The same applies to progressive enterprises. They have understood that it is only possible to do business when the fundamental structures for commerce are in place. We need to establish an alliance with green business. We in Parliament also need to take action. The UN has established eight major groups: business, urban areas, women, trade unions, etc. Parliaments also need to become more involved, which is why it was a pity that we did not have an official delegation at the conference. We should form a major group at UN conferences under the ‘parliaments’ banner. Jo Leinen  (S&amp;D

 Mr President, it is, in any case, a bad habit that we have here in Parliament that a text is read out for one or two minutes and people cannot speak on one or two thoughts without notes. That has annoyed me ever since I joined the European Parliament. However, I will use my time for the subject in hand. Mr Potočnik, you quite rightly described the 2050 energy road map as a great transformation for our economy and society, for production and consumption. For this great transformation, you need all the players, and at all levels. I think it is good that you are establishing a platform for resource efficiency in Brussels. We ought to have the same thing at the level of the Member States and the regions, right down to municipalities. My question is this: do you have a plan for this? Mr Bütikofer rightly asked about resource efficiency plans. That is the same subject. For climate protection, we have the National Adaptation Programmes of Action (NAPAs) and the Nationally Appropriate Mitigation Actions (NAMAs). Naturally, we also need resource efficiency plans here. Do you intend to present this to the Member States? Then, of course, you will need all the other portfolios. I will simply mention the finance ministers – this has already been mentioned: the phasing out of environmentally harmful subsidies, the incorporation of external costs into our tax system. How can we win over the finance ministers and, not least, the ministers for economic affairs? We need new business models that reward sustainability and not the consumption of resources. For that, we need to think about something new with the ministers for economic affairs. (The speaker agreed to take a blue-card question under Rule 149(8)) Jo Leinen  (S&amp;D

Blue-card answer.
 – (DE)
 Thank you for your follow-up question, Ms Merkies. In fact, the traditional business model is built upon the consumption, and even the wasting, of resources. The manufacturer produces something, does not deal with the waste, the product goes to the consumer and perhaps also ends up being thrown away. That is no longer acceptable. We need a new business model in which the manufacturer is responsible – from production through to recovery, to recycling. Then, I believe, there will be new designs for products. There are new responsibilities for recirculation. That is the direction we must move in. Jo Leinen,

 Mr President, Mr Potočnik, ladies and gentlemen, the European Parliament wants to introduce a 7th Environment Action Programme (EAP) in the European Union. It would not make sense for us to give up our efforts to improve the quality of the environment and of health in Europe when the 6th EAP comes to an end in June. However, the 7th EAP must not be a copy of the 6th programme. We have come much further along the road and we are facing much bigger challenges. We need to take a new approach in the 7th EAP: a horizontal approach covering all other areas of policy. We are exposed to systemic risks. Mr Potočnik, you have just mentioned the fact that climate change, the loss of biodiversity and the shortage of resources are all challenges which cannot be overcome by traditional environmental policy alone. We need to involve all the other portfolios and all the other policy areas in the EU and, in particular, energy and transport policy, agriculture and fisheries policy, cohesion policy and, most importantly, economic and financial policy. I would like to emphasise this point, because this is the most difficult aspect. How can we ensure that the finance and economy ministers treat greening as a central issue within their areas? Parliament has drafted 80 paragraphs containing proposals for the content and the procedure for a 7th EAP and these include calls for the abolition of subsidies which harm the environment. Following the greening of tax policy, we must incorporate external costs in our prices. The principle that the polluter pays must be applied gradually. As part of our macro-economic controls, we also need to monitor sustainability within the European Semester. We have come up with many other ideas in this area. Europe’s environmental footprint as a whole is far too large. If all the 7 billion people on this planet today and the 9 billion that there will be by the middle of the century were to use as much energy and as many resources as we do, we would need two planets, not just one. We know that there are limits to the resources which our planet can provide. For this reason, we need to make major cuts in our resource consumption. The 7th EAP must open the door to a green economy and to a policy of resource efficiency. We need to focus, in particular, on urban environments. More and more people are living in large conurbations and in these areas, we can set a good example of resource management and resource efficiency. Green cities are our objective in Europe. There are many good examples and best practices which must be applied everywhere. Of course, protecting the environment should also help us to protect people’s health. We must send out a clear message to the public that protecting the environment and public health form an integral part of the 7th EAP. This will help to ensure that it gains acceptance. There are still a number of difficulties in this area. Air pollution levels are still too high and noise pollution is a huge problem. Noise is an issue that has been neglected and completely underrated in our environmental policy. There are still many toxic chemicals that make their way into the environment and have an impact on health. Nanomaterials and other new materials need careful investigation and also present us with new challenges. The best legislation and the best programmes are useless if they are not implemented. The 7th EAP must resolve the problem of the implementation deficit. Ultimately, I believe that Europe must send a message to the world that we need sustainable management. Otherwise, the human race will not survive on earth. Jo Leinen,  
rapporteur.

 Mr President, the debate has shown that there is a consensus in favour of the 7th Environment Action Programme (EAP) within the European Parliament. I would like to thank all the shadow rapporteurs who have helped us to reach this consensus. I would also like to thank Mr Potočnik, who took the initiative within the Commission, because not everyone there supported the 7th EAP at first sight. It is clear that there was a certain level of resistance. Following the debate in the Council of Environment Ministers and in the European Parliament, it is clear how useful and how important a 7th EAP can be, because it brings together all the objectives which were previously spread across different strategies and road maps. The amalgamation of these objectives, the message that Europe’s environmental footprint must be reduced and the measures needed to achieve this are the main points of the 7th EAP. I would like to say once again that we need to address our calls to the finance and economy ministers. I hope that the report will not be watered down during the vote later today. We must call for the greening of tax policy and economic policy because we will not be able to make our economy sustainable by means of environmental policy alone. This point has been made in many of today’s speeches. The environmental strategy must be reflected in the finance strategy. We will soon be debating the medium-term financial plan up to 2020 and the Commission has proposed putting aside for climate change and sustainability 20% of the billions of euro available. I believe that this should be a minimum and I hope that Parliament can increase this figure during the negotiations. We must not allow 80% of the funding to be devoted to areas that go against the environment and only 20% to be used to protect the environment. Overall, this has been an important debate and we are looking forward to your draft, Mr Potočnik. This will go into the ordinary legislative procedure where it will be finalised. We will help to ensure that the result is an ambitious programme. Jo Leinen  (S&amp;D

 Mr Casini, would you agree that, if it accedes to the Convention on Human Rights, the EU must then support the provision of better facilities for the Court in Strasbourg? We know that the judges are completely overloaded and have poorer facilities than the judges in Luxembourg. The EU should – and I am asking you whether you agree with this – ensure that they have the same working conditions, the same standards and the same facilities, as then we can also hope for sound judgments. Would you come out in favour of Parliament and the EU supporting better facilities for the Court in Strasbourg? Jo Leinen,

 Mr President, Commissioner, climate protection requires immediate measures, as well as a long-term strategy if we are to achieve the objective of stabilising the Earth’s atmosphere at 2 °C. The Group of the Progressive Alliance of Socialists and Democrats in the European Parliament supports your Roadmap for 2050. It is an extremely important element in guaranteeing planning certainty and clarity in relation to where the path is to take us. All those involved, particularly the economic sector, eagerly await this planning certainty and clarity. This makes it all the more regrettable that Friday’s Environment Council meeting was blocked by one country, showing itself to be incapable of making political decisions. I would like to ask the Commission: what is your strategy for rescuing Poland from this psychological and political isolation? We need Poland. Poland is an important country. We need to make it clear that Poland also has enormous opportunities to modernise its economy and deploy new technology in pursuing its climate strategy. Perhaps it is necessary to clarify the assistance the EU can offer and the way in which the effort is distributed among all 27 countries, all of which share a common goal, but which may have different ways of reaching that goal. Commissioner, you must be able to provide an answer here. If we want to reduce CO2
 emissions by 80 to 95%, we need to embrace all sectors, not just industry, but also transport and agriculture. I hope that the amendments tabled here will not dilute our report. We need to speak out clearly in relation to climate neutrality in the transport sector and in favour of major efforts in the agricultural sector. We would encourage you to include not just aviation, but also marine transport in the emissions trading system. You need to show leadership here, and you should not give in. The Emissions Trading System is not working. You need to take corrective action. This report indicates how this can work. I believe, in the final analysis, that we are witnessing a new industrial revolution. The issue at stake is a competitive European economy and climate protection is a key element in the competitiveness of Europe in the 21st century. Jo Leinen  (S&amp;D

 Mr President, I am opposed to the motion. This is a complete surprise from the Group of the European People’s Party (Christian Democrats). We have discussed the motion in the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Food Safety. We have the advantage of excellent groundwork by the Committee on Industry, Research and Energy and the Committee on Agriculture and Rural Development and have discussed this in detail this morning. The Commission and industry at large must know how matters are to proceed with regard to climate protection. I am in favour of voting on this matter today. Jo Leinen,

 Mr President, Ms Hedegaard, the Group of the Progressive Alliance of Socialists and Democrats in the European Parliament would also like to congratulate you on your handling of the negotiations in Durban. The EU has demonstrated its strong leadership skills and this has paid off. I am also pleased about the climate diplomacy and the coalition of 120 states. I would like to see China joining our strategic coalition, alongside Africa. China is moving towards taking over worldwide responsibility. This would send out a signal to the US to bring an end to its policy of denial and to join the mainstream of international climate policy. We have prevented a fiasco and we have produced the road map which we will have to work on. There is, of course, a great deal for us to do at home. We have the gigatonne gap and if Europe wants to play a leading role, it will have to do more than it has in the past. I hope that there will be new initiatives which go beyond 20%. We must take the hot air out of Kyoto 2. The policy cannot really be credible with all these surplus certificates. I would like to encourage you to remain tough in the areas of aviation and shipping and to take new initiatives. It is totally absurd that the US Congress can pass a law banning airlines from taking part in our legislation. We must not allow this to happen and Parliament would like to see you maintaining your tough stance. Jo Leinen,

 Mr President, Ms Maćkowiak-Pandera, Ms Hedegaard, ladies and gentlemen, this week, the European Parliament is submitting a resolution which includes comprehensive proposals on combating global climate change. Mr President, I know that you are committed to overcoming climate change and it would, of course, be good if you could come with the parliamentary delegation to Durban. However, I understand the constraints you are under here in the House with regard to the 2012 budget. Nevertheless, a strong delegation will be going to Durban ready to exert pressure and to use its lobbying skills, so that the process of combating climate change does not come to a halt and so that we can continue to make progress. I would like to thank the sponsors from the five groups who have drawn up this resolution. There was a broad consensus in the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Food Safety about what should now be done and we had the support of the Committee on Development and the Committee on Industry, Research and Energy. Parliament has clear ideas about what we need to achieve in the 17th Conference of the Parties (COP 17) to the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC). We have no time to lose. The extreme weather events in 2011 alone and the melting of the glaciers and icebergs show that climate change is well under way. This is why we need to make substantial progress at the COP 17. Parliament’s goal remains the same: a legally binding instrument for all states in the UNFCCC or a global climate agreement, if you want to call it that. We will not be able to achieve this in Durban, but we need to establish further milestones on the road to a global climate agreement. This is primarily about meeting the promises and the undertakings which were made last year in Cancún. I will only mention the mechanism for technology transfer from rich northern countries to poorer southern ones and the institutions which will put in place the necessary measures to allow us to adapt to climate change. However, there are other open issues which we can hopefully resolve in Durban. One of these concerns closing the gigatonne gap. In Cancún, everyone agreed that we want to limit the global temperature increase to 2 degrees Celsius, but the commitments that are already on the table are not sufficient. We will end up with an increase of 3.5 or 4 degrees Celsius, which is much too much, as we all know. Therefore, we need to understand how the gigatonne gap can be closed on the basis of common but differing responsibilities for stabilising the earth’s atmosphere. We in Parliament are of the opinion that greenhouse gas emissions will peak in 2015 and this is a very ambitious goal. However, the scientists are telling us that we have to reach this point during this decade. We know that by 2050, we must reduce our greenhouse gas emissions by around 50%, which is a huge task. In Durban, the focus is likely to be on the Kyoto Protocol. We must prevent a gap from occurring between the first commitment period and a further second commitment period. Therefore, we need a solution for the period after 2012 and Parliament is calling on the EU to give its clear support to a second commitment period. We know that we do not have many partners, but they include Switzerland and Norway, together with Australia and New Zealand. I believe that with effective climate change diplomacy, we can achieve a critical mass which will make it worthwhile to implement Kyoto II and, at the same time and most importantly, to force the emerging countries and also the USA to commit to a timetable involving everyone. The idea is that we will succeed in implementing an overarching climate agreement in 2015. I would like to mention an issue that we are all aware of: the funding for combating global climate change. We hope that we can establish a Green Climate Fund in Durban, but we need to know who will manage it, who can become a member, how it will work and where the funding will come from. Parliament has made a number of suggestions including the income from emissions trading, taxes on aviation and shipping and the financial transaction tax, if it is imposed. I shall be brief. We must not use the economic crisis as an excuse for doing nothing. The message that comes out of Durban must make it clear that we cannot allow climate change to overcome the human race. Instead, the human race must have the determination to overcome climate change. That is the message that the European Parliament is taking to South Africa. Jo Leinen,

 Mr President, President-in-Office of the Council, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Food Safety here in the European Parliament, in the ‘citizens’ chamber’ of the European Union, is tabling a motion for a resolution in order to raise awareness of the threat to public health caused by the resistance of bacteria to antibiotics and to call on the Commission and the Member States to establish an action programme to combat this threat to public health. I am the Chair of the committee, not the author of this resolution, and you can see that we had sponsors from all political parties. We are in agreement in the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Food Safety that we have a ticking time bomb here, a major problem for the health of our citizens, and that there is an urgent need for action. We need an action plan, because the health authorities in Europe are alarmed. During visits this year to the European Medicines Agency (EMA) in London and also to the European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control (ECDC) in Stockholm, our attention was once again drawn by these specialist agencies of the European Union to this problem in particular. In the EU, around 25 000 people a year are now dying of infections caused by resistant bacteria. If we look at the situation, up to the end of the 1970s there was a great deal of activity in the pharmaceuticals industry aimed at developing new molecules and new agents. Since the end of the 1970s, the activity has diminished and come to a standstill. So, if you like, we stopped focusing on this problem 40 years ago. We are simply lacking new agents to fight this resistance. Commissioner Dalli, at this point the first demand that I am going to make is directed at you as the Commissioner responsible, and it is a call on the Commission to draw up a road map with the industry concerned in order to show more commitment to the search for and development of new molecules and new agents. Together with the actors involved in research and industry, you should draw up this road map so that we can obtain a new protection mechanism. We have mentioned a second issue, with regard to which we would ask you – as well as the Member States – to be actively engaged. Antibiotics help to reduce diseases, but if they are not used properly they can also cause damage. We have discovered that antibiotics are used entirely differently in the 27 Member States of the European Union. The Eurobarometer survey has shown how much ignorance there is. Of the people questioned, 53% believe that antibiotics kill viruses and 43% believe that antibiotics are effective against colds and flu. We can imagine how great the misuse of these substances must be, which then contributes to the resistance and puts other people at risk. We are therefore calling on the Commission to define general principles and best practices for the prudent use of antibiotics for 500 million people, for all 27 Member States, and also to ensure that these guidelines are actually implemented and put into practice everywhere in the European Union. We need a major awareness campaign in this area. We believe that we also need a well-functioning monitoring and surveillance system in this sector. The ECDC in Stockholm is our sectoral authority. We need good data, sound surveys and, of course, also analyses of trends and early warnings of the spread of such resistance. Ladies and gentlemen, there is one final issue that we have addressed in a serious way: the cross-transmission of resistance from animals to humans. Antibiotics are used in veterinary medicine as well as human medicine. There are strong indications that crossovers exist. That means that we need cooperation with veterinary medicine in this regard, above all in order to reduce and prohibit the prophylactic use of antibiotics in intensive livestock farming. In this regard, Commissioner, I hope that our resolution will also serve as a mandate for you as well as for the Polish Presidency to take action so that we can protect our citizens against this new threat to health. (Applause) Jo Leinen  (S&amp;D
).  
– Mr President, I want to make a clarification on paragraph 8 because the formulation is misleading. It reads now in the old text ‘is concerned about the focus given to the green economy as one of the two main themes of the Rio Summit’ – ‘is concerned’ seems to be negative, so it should be ‘concerning the focus given to the green economy as one of the two main themes of the Rio Summit’. This is my oral amendment, not ‘is concerned’, but ‘concerning’. This is not negative, we want the green economy. That is the explanation to the Greens who asked me whether this is positive or negative – it is positive. Jo Leinen  (S&amp;D

 Mr President, Mr Barroso, you have called for a renaissance of the European idea. I believe that we agree that the European idea is good, but it requires a new foundation and a new profile to explain why we need Europe and also more Europe in the 21st century. As the Chair of the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Food Safety, one thing is clear to me. Europe must become a stability union from an environmental perspective and not just from a financial perspective. Young people understand above all that with 9 billion of us living on the planet by the middle part of the century, we will be fighting for energy, raw materials and food. Therefore, let us establish a European pact for environmental stability which includes energy efficiency, the efficient use of resources and sustainability. We have started to do this and it must not be allowed to get lost or be given a lower priority during the crisis. These problems will not go away. They will remain and they may even become more pronounced. Please encourage the whole of the Commission to make progress with the environmental profile of the EU. We will have the young people of Europe behind us. Jo Leinen,

 Mr President, President-in-Office of the Council, Professor Kraszewski, Ms Hedegaard, Mr Potočnik, ladies and gentlemen, the European Parliament very much welcomes the fact that the United Nations is holding the Rio+20 conference. We are submitting a resolution to the European Parliament which has been sponsored by Members from a number of different political groups, in other words, it has broad support in this House, and which states that this Earth summit next year in Brazil must be a success. If we look back 20 years to the first Rio conference in 1992, there was a huge amount of commitment and hope that we would be able to reverse the trend in our economic activities on this planet. When we consider what has happened over the last 20 years, there has certainly been a lot of commitment. Some things have been achieved, but the trends and the megatrends are still going in the wrong direction. If we look at the economy, and we discussed it at length this morning, we can see that a financial economy has developed alongside the real economy, which is far more powerful than the traditional economy. The speculation in the financial economy is threatening the real economy and also jeopardising whole countries and regions and many, many people. If we look at developments in the social sector over the last 20 years, there is incredible wealth and unfortunately also incredible poverty. The divide between rich and poor is getting wider. If we move on to the environment, it is clear that our environmental footprint on this planet is still a negative one. Over the last 20 years we have cleared huge areas of forest. We have overfished the seas. We have used up energy resources which took millions of years to form. We have damaged the soil. These are warning signs for the 21st century which indicate to us that we cannot go on like this. There must be a change of direction. We really need to make a renewed attempt to introduce sustainable development. We need a new departure next year in Rio. We need a new political will and a new sense of commitment. We also need an agenda with concrete proposals. It is clear that the three pillars – the economy, the environment and social development – must be better integrated. Economic activities are a good thing, but the economy must serve people and the environment. An economy which destroys people and the environment is not a good economy. We must redefine our economic activities in this broader context. Parliament has made a number of proposals about what is needed: the creation of the right basic conditions, regulation, but also marketable instruments, which will help the economies in our countries to bring in private capital, and the management of natural capital in order to prevent it from being overused and to intervene when ecosystems are exploited. The balance sheet for our activities is the gross domestic product or GDP. We know that GDP is no longer adequate, because it does not tell the whole truth about our activities from an environmental and social perspective. This is why we believe that the leitmotif for the next few years, for the next decade, must be a sustainable economy, a low-carbon, resource-efficient economy. We know that people all over the world do not have fair access to resources. We see large estates being bought up and in many countries, including in Africa, there is the risk that people will no longer be able to cultivate their own food as a result of land theft. This is a phenomenon which we need to devote our attention to. It is clear that many people do not have access to energy. Around 2 billion people have no proper, regular energy supply, which is a huge disadvantage in terms of development. Access to water is by no means evenly distributed all over the world. I only want to mention these three issues. However, there are other obstacles which prevent people from accessing resources easily because they are poor, underprivileged or have other problems. To make sustainable development possible, we need to shift the burden of taxes paid by the citizens of our countries. Currently the major part of the tax burden relates to the work which is done and it is clear that this tax burden must be reduced and shifted from work to the consumption of natural resources and energy. This is an important subject for which we also need the support of the finance ministers and ministers of economic affairs in the Member States. I would like to say in conclusion that sustainability requires commitment from the local level through to the global level. Civil society is a very important resource. People must take part and we must involve them. The state has a job to do, but the private sector also has responsibilities. We must ensure that the private sector does more to make use of its knowledge and expertise in the service of sustainability. At a global level, we simply need better governance, a better structure, in order to organise these environmental and sustainable trends. In Rio we will be discussing whether the United Nations environment programme (UNEP) is adequate in its current form. The answer is clear: it is not. We need better structures at a global level. We in Parliament are hoping that the EU will speak with one voice. We will have a delegation in Durban and we will help to ensure that Europe sets itself a genuine target and plays a pioneering role. We need an agenda 2020 for sustainable development on this planet. Jo Leinen,

Madam President, Commissioner, we, too, welcome your communication on improving civil protection in the European Union. Citizens in Europe expect us to respond quickly and efficiently in the event of a disaster and, above all, to help each other. In the past, we have sometimes sat helpless in front of the television watching forest fires in southern Europe and asked ourselves: why are the others not helping? Your communication now represents the next step towards European solidarity and the efficient use of the capacities that we have in Europe. We have everything that we need. We really do have all of the facilities we need to deal with disasters in Europe. In that respect, this is a positive step forward. As a previous speaker said, national capacities should not be replaced by centralisation at EU level, but we do need to exploit synergies. We really do need everyone to act swiftly together. This is also urgently needed now. I also agree that we need to think more and more in terms of prevention. We need to deal in the right way with the information that we have and must not wait until a disaster has occurred. We can do a great deal with regard to flooding or potential droughts, where fires frequently break out. I am pleased that we will now organise civil protection, both in the EU and also outside the EU, in a coherent way. I agree with Mr Seeber: the areas of responsibility ought to be clear. You are responsible. You ought to accept that responsibility and not permit the areas of responsibility to be mixed up so that we no longer know who is responsible. Finally, I believe that this 24/7 preparedness must always be ensured, including at Christmas, during New Year, on public holidays, and during the summer, too. That is very important. I would like to thank Ms Gardini for her excellent report. Jo Leinen  (S&amp;D

 Madam President, Mr Søndergaard, if we have a list of 25 candidates, these candidates will clearly not all come from a single country, but from 25 countries. Each party will arrange it that way. Would you agree, therefore, that it will actually be the small countries that have the relative advantage and not the large ones? It is precisely the opposite of what you are arguing. Jo Leinen  (S&amp;D

 Madam President, 30 years after the first direct election to the European Parliament, we need a fundamental reform of the electoral system. The shortcomings of the European elections are clear. We must not stagnate, we must not stand still; instead, we must take the next step forward. The next step is indeed this strategic instrument of European lists alongside the national lists. Democracy involves discourse and deliberation, as Professor Habermas used to say. That is exactly our problem. The political class has a national system of discourse. The debates remain in the national realm. We have no overarching European debate, no European political realm, and the European lists would force the political class to come together and to think in European terms, to argue from a European point of view and also to make the alternatives clear to citizens with regard to the forms of Europe they have to choose from in the elections. I hope that we will succeed in implementing these European lists with your report, Mr Duff. We need this vision, and we should not give in. Parliament has already taken a decision in this regard once before, and we cannot be less ambitious than our predecessors. Jo Leinen  (S&amp;D

 Mr President, Mr Dalli, ladies and gentlemen, Europe’s response to genetically modified (GM) crops is different from that of North and South America. We know that GM crops are widely grown not only in the USA and Canada, but also in Argentina and Brazil. However, Eurobarometer surveys show that the opinions of the large majority of the people of Europe on this subject range from scepticism to opposition. For this reason, it would be wrong for Brussels to force the Member States to accept GM crops. It would not be the right thing to do and it would not be accepted. I believe that Parliament and the Commission are moving towards transferring the responsibility and the competence for this area to the Member States. Each country must decide for itself whether or not it wants to introduce genetically modified plants into the environment. It is rather regrettable that we do not have unity within Europe, but that is the reality of the situation. I think that this approach is the right one because the countries which do not want genetically modified organisms (GMOs) should not be forced to use them. Now we need legal certainty concerning the grounds on which GMOs can be opposed. The Commission has referred to some of the reasons, but these are not enough. A number of gaps remain. Mrs Lepage’s report fills precisely these gaps in the environmental aspects. We have totally different ecosystems and different approaches to the environment. This report is definitely a step in the right direction and I hope it is successful. We will be supporting it in any case. What we also need is freedom of choice for farmers and for consumers. Mr Dalli, we urgently need a regulation concerning the distance between GMO fields and conventional crops. First of all, though, Mrs Lepage’s report must achieve a majority in plenary tomorrow. Jo Leinen  (S&amp;D

 Mr President, I would like to inform the House that voting in favour of the first part of the next amendment would mean voting against the energy and climate package of 2008. We have a lot of studies from the Commission showing that fulfilling the climate package means a 25 % reduction, so I would like to ask the House to vote against this amendment. Jo Leinen  (S&amp;D
). 
 – (DE)
 Madam President, Mr Oettinger, ladies and gentlemen, the Group of the Progressive Alliance of Socialists and Democrats in the European Parliament supports Mr Eickhout’s report because it sends out a strong message both internally and externally that we are not giving up on combating climate change. It is an internal signal that we are taking seriously the promise made in the 2008 climate package of 20% renewable energy and 20% energy savings. Mr Oettinger, you have presented us with a proposal today and we have a great deal of work ahead of us. Both of these measures together will result in a 25% reduction in CO2
 emissions within the EU. Who could be opposed to this? It is not possible, because it is a package of legislation which we have adopted. In addition, we have a responsibility to the rest of the world. We also have to achieve a level of 5% clean development mechanisms (CDMs). That makes a total of 30%. I hope that this will not be watered down. The amendment to paragraph 3 would destroy the entire report. If this amendment is passed, we will be voting against the report tomorrow. I hope that this will not be the case, because we need to send out a strong signal. Jo Leinen  (S&amp;D
). - 
 Madam President, on a point of order, we are holding a debate now with the Commissioner, not a debate amongst ourselves and amongst the political groups. I think, under the Rules, we have one blue card and not six or seven. Jo Leinen  (S&amp;D

Madam President, Mr Oettinger, the stress tests are necessary and also long overdue. It is surprising that they have not been carried out before. You should take the credit for the fact that all the nuclear power stations in the EU are finally going to be inspected. However, we must admit that we are skating on very thin ice with these stress tests. You have rightly said that several countries were not prepared to take part in a European inspection procedure. Of course, there is the risk that the inspection will differ from country to country. Some will not want to include aircraft crashes and others will only open up a part of their plants for stress tests. You need to make sure that the tests are genuinely comprehensive. It is also clear that you have not made a comprehensive evaluation. The area of human failure is incomplete. The risk now and in future is not that an aircraft will accidentally crash on a nuclear power plant, but that there will be targeted attacks on these plants from outside. That is precisely what is not being tested. I live on the border with France and Luxembourg and there are four nuclear power stations in Cattenom. We have been told that the fire service and the police are responsible for them. I imagine that al-Qaeda and other terrorists will almost die laughing when they find out that the fire service and the police are responsible for preventing the threat of terrorism. This really must be included in the stress test. Finally, what will the consequences be if you find errors and weak points? There is the risk that we will not be able to do anything at a European level and that it will all come to nothing. Will some of the power plants really be shut down or modernised? It is high time that the Euratom Treaty was revised. This situation, where we have no influence over the safety of nuclear power stations, cannot continue. Jo Leinen  (S&amp;D

 Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, farmers can be compensated, but human life cannot be recovered. Indeed, our sympathy goes out to all those who have died or are lying in a hospital bed. This situation is dramatic and it is also unacceptable. It is unacceptable that three weeks after the outbreak of this crisis, we still do not know exactly where the pathogen that caused the crisis originated. That really should not happen in Europe. There are several lessons we need to learn from this. Firstly, we need to look for the source and examine whether improper practices are still present in the food production sector or in the food supply chain. We have legislation that has been in place for 20 years, and the standards and codes of practices in the European Union are quite stringent, but it is clear that we are still vulnerable when it comes to foodstuffs. There still seem to be gaps and shortcomings and we need to learn from this once again. I also think that the communication on this matter has been chaotic. Facts about this matter are not communicated well or in the right way. We clearly need more Europe. That has already been said by other Members here. When any regional or national authority issues a warning for the whole of Europe, it can only be a disaster. In my view, the European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control (ECDC) has done a good job, as far as I can see, but we need a better, modern reporting obligation for determining the causes and also a better system for informing the general public. Jo Leinen,  
rapporteur.

 Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, today we are debating, and tomorrow we will adopt, European legislation that, on first impression, seems rather unremarkable, but with this law on European environmental economic accounts, we are probably opening a new chapter in the measurement of progress and prosperity. We have known for a long time that gross national product is inadequate. The purely quantitative view of economic activity says nothing about the environmental balance sheet, nor about the social balance sheet, and therefore it is high time that we measured whether, year on year, we are doing well or badly in terms of our measures and efforts. We have monthly statistics relating to our labour market figures and we have annual statistics relating to our economic figures. We therefore know exactly what is happening in these areas. However, we have an incomplete patchwork of data on the environmental impact. This law on environmental economic accounts is intended to help us to draw up an accurate balance sheet in the 27 Member States and to establish whether we are making progress or, as is often the case, whether we are going backwards. As long ago as 2002, Parliament called for reliable information to be collected on the state of the environment and the most important trends in, influences on, and causes of, environmental change, and for the public to be informed of these things. We want a scientifically sound concept for measuring the consumption of resources to enable appropriate political decisions to be taken. We are pleased that the Commission took this legislative initiative in April 2010, but in our opinion, it was much too tentative in the way it went about it. We in Parliament and all of the groups have called for this to be done much more quickly, because the Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD) and the United Nations have already been discussing these matters for 15 years. This is taking far too long. We have therefore made considerable progress in the negotiations with the Council. It was a very difficult situation in the Council, because some Member States do not produce an environmental balance sheet and we first need to create a foundation in all 27 Member States. The Commission proposed the inclusion of three modules. These modules are air emissions – in this regard, we are very well aware of which gases are emitted into the air. Then there is the financial expenditure arising from environmental taxes and environmental charges. Thirdly, there are the year-on-year national material flows, the input and output, measured in purely quantitative terms. This is a start, perhaps, but it is too simple a start, and Parliament has called for us also to produce water, energy and waste balance sheets and to find out about the status of our forests. These are the modules that we urgently want to see in the very near future. There was disagreement about whether statistics can also be produced for the marine environment, in other words, statistics on the status of fish stocks. In this regard, our methodology is probably still in need of improvement. Thus, we have achieved improvements in this area. In two years’ time – by 2013 at the latest – the Commission is to present a report and, where possible, also propose a revision of this directive. I hope that, at the end of this decade, we will have a green national product in addition to the gross national product. That is our goal. Jo Leinen,  
rapporteur.

 Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, thank you for the debate. I see broad support for the creation of environmental balance sheets in the European Union. With a few exceptions, this has found favour here. I also agree with Mrs Kadenbach’s statement. Many of us thought that this was already in place, and we were surprised to find that a lot of data does not exist at all, and that in the statements we make with regard to the state of the environment in the European Union, we are therefore actually completely blind. One Member, Mr Gerbrandy, said that measurement brings knowledge. We then know something, and knowledge is the basis for taking measures and for all of our programmes. We quite simply need a better basis for the decisions that we take. These environmental accounts can help us in this regard. Of course, we have the EU 2020 strategy, in which sustainability is a planning goal. I hope that in the next few years, we will also have this basis so that in 2020, we will be able to see whether we were successful or not. We know that gross domestic product provides no information on the state of the natural world and the environment, on resources that we have used, or on the whole sustainability problem. That is why this is now necessary. We are also tackling this in stages. Mrs Klaß, we are not making excessive demands; rather, the modules are to be expanded gradually. After all, as the Commissioner said, the individual pieces of legislation – the water legislation, waste legislation and clean air legislation – already contain the requirement to collect this data. Europe is also under a global obligation, Mr Nuttall. If we sign the Convention on Biological Diversity, the Convention on Climate Change or any other convention, we must be able to tell the rest of the world whether we have done well or badly. Thus, all in all, I would like to thank the shadow rapporteurs and also Eurostat, which will subsequently have to carry out the work. I hope that the necessary resources will be available in Luxembourg, because without funds, without resources, this balance sheet cannot, of course, be produced. Parliament should also help out in this regard. Thank you very much. This is an important political matter – as some people have rightly recognised – and it is a new chapter in the consideration of what we do in Europe year in year out. Jo Leinen,

 Madam President, Mrs Győri, Mr Dalli, ladies and gentlemen, I have been involved in many negotiation processes here in Parliament, but the 12 hours of this conciliation procedure, which lasted from 19:00 to 07:00 the next morning, will remain in my memory for a long time. This was a very special event. Unfortunately, the two sides came from different planets. Parliament’s approach was clear, which was to focus on the interests of consumers and of the citizens of the EU. Others were considering the interests of the meat and agriculture industries. Because of these divergent approaches, we were not able to reach an agreement. This is a pity, because we now have a gap in the EU food legislation which we need to close very quickly. We were all relatively clear about this, including Mr Pittella, who acted as chair, and the rapporteur. The entire team was pulling together. Now we need to take the next step. We must fill this gap. Mr Dalli, you must present two proposals: one on novel foods, because we have almost reached a consensus on this with regard to nanomaterials, the centralised approval process and imports from third countries. The other proposal concerns cloning. You have listened to everything that we have to say on this subject. We do not want these products on the European market. At the very least, we want them to be labelled, because consumers should have freedom of choice. That is your job and Parliament is ready to support you. I hope you will be able to submit a proposal very soon. Jo Leinen,  
on behalf of the S&amp;D Group

 Mr President, Mr Oettinger, ladies and gentlemen, I would like to thank Mr Sonik for triggering this debate and for preparing the oral question. I agree that we should never forget the Chernobyl disaster. We are well aware that the long-term consequences of the catastrophe are still being experienced a full quarter century later. There is still a large uninhabitable area, so that people can no longer return to their homes. Then there is the long-term impact on health. Television has shown us that women still suffer miscarriages 25 years after the disaster. Europe shares some of the responsibility because the issue of nuclear safety is not a matter of national sovereignty, but rather one of European responsibility. On this densely populated continent, every nuclear power plant has consequences for neighbouring countries. It is for this reason, Mr Oettinger, that you have particular responsibility for ensuring that we get to grips with this topic, especially in the light of what has happened in Fukushima. Later on we are going to talk with you about the stress tests, in other words the safety analyses for the 143 nuclear power plants. I would encourage you to stick to your principles. We want the highest possible safety standard in Europe, not just investigations into natural disasters. Accordingly we must also investigate other risks, such as plane crashes, terrorist attacks, computer attacks, in other words this combination of attacks on nuclear power plants; what is more, you must guarantee that this does not become simply a token gesture. There is still a great deal to be done in Chernobyl. The sarcophagus is not yet safe, which is why new financial resources are required to put this in order. I have not yet heard any plans for what to do with the nuclear waste lying about the site; the disposal of this material is not yet assured. Accordingly I believe, Mr Reul, that research studies are necessary because we do not have enough experience with the long-term effects of radiation. I would encourage the Commission to put such studies in motion. In the final analysis, the safest option is the nuclear exit strategy. As we continue to cooperate with the affected countries, my greatest wish is that we should establish workshops for future technology there, and provide advice on how to save energy and develop alternative energy sources. This is precisely what is needed 25 years after Chernobyl. (The speaker agrees to take a question in accordance with Rule 149(8) of the Rules of Procedure.) Jo Leinen  (S&amp;D
). 
 – (DE)
 Mr President, I would like to thank Mr Rübig for his question. The aim must be to establish a European competence for monitoring nuclear power stations. If an issue has an impact that goes beyond national borders, then this involves a European dimension, which also requires a European competence. Mr Oettinger, we do not yet have this competence, however you must do all you can to ensure that we are given the basis to monitor nuclear plants independently and objectively from a European perspective, enabling us to draw our own conclusions when weaknesses are pinpointed. If the stress test shows that a power plant is unsafe, then it must be shut down or, if possible, upgraded. Jo Leinen  (S&amp;D
). 
 – (DE)
 Mr President, you have heard what the Chair of the Committee on Industry, Research and Energy has said. Now I am speaking as Chair of the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Food Safety and the differences could not be greater. The fact that we need the highest safety levels for all nuclear power plants goes without saying. We all agree on that. Mr Oettinger, your stress test is an important first step, but it does not go nearly far enough. I also believe that we need to rethink our approach and come up with a new one which goes into greater depth and is far more fundamental. This is why, in addition to the highest safety standards in the EU, we also need an exit scenario from a risky technology, which we cannot justify using on the densely populated continent of Europe. Mr Reul, you and others will simply have to go along with this. Your colleagues in Berlin have made much more progress than you have here in Strasbourg and in Brussels. They have probably reached the turning point, while you are still stuck with your old ideas. I hope that we can come up with a formulation, a scenario and a strategy for exiting from nuclear power. Mr Oettinger, the road map which you are producing in June of this year would be a wonderful opportunity to achieve this. After the stress tests, you must also give us your idea of how we can get out of nuclear technology. (Applause) Jo Leinen  (S&amp;D

 Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, the Treaty of Lisbon, on which work went on for so long, had two clear messages: firstly, the strengthening of the Community method with a central role for the Commission and, secondly, the strengthening of democracy with the participation of the European Parliament. Little more than a year after the entry into force of the Treaty, the spirit of Lisbon is already being ignored and ridden roughshod over. What the European Council has devised with this revision of the Treaty is unequivocally contrary to both of these messages of the Treaty of Lisbon. The Community method is not being strengthened – instead, what we have is renationalisation, intergovernmentalisation, in an important area of future EU policy and the complete exclusion of the bodies of the EU. That is unacceptable and Parliament actually has to be opposed to this proposal. It amazes me that the Commission, as guardian of the Treaties, has not spoken up more clearly and that we here in Parliament have to act, to some extent, as representatives of the Commission. We must push the Commission into action that it should already have taken. A dangerous precedent is being set here. We are observing as a result of the economic crisis that monetary union cannot exist alone. Given the influx of refugees from North Africa and the uncertainty in our neighbourhood, we are seeking additional EU policies and we do not want renationalisation. I hope that the rapporteurs can still make improvements as otherwise, I cannot vote in favour of this revision of the Treaty. Jo Leinen  (S&amp;D
). 
 – (DE)
 Mr President, the first energy summit in the history of the European Union will take place on Friday, because, with the entry into force of the Treaty of Lisbon, the Union has direct responsibilities in this sector for the first time. I agree with Mr Barroso that energy policy may be the European Union’s next big integration project. There are very many aspects to this, and President Buzek has always said that we need an energy community in the EU. Where this summit was concerned, there were many hopes and expectations that the European Union’s strategic questions with regard to energy supply would be answered. What are the strategic questions? Yes, Mr Saryusz-Wolski, they include the EU’s dependence on energy imports. They include the enormous amount of energy that is still being wasted, and there are also the negative consequences of the current energy system on ecosystems and in particular on the Earth’s atmosphere. When I look at the Council conclusions, I have to say that this energy summit is going to be a huge disappointment, because it will not answer any of these major questions. It has actually been poorly prepared in terms of the common vision that we need and it has also been poorly prepared in terms of the coherence of the resources and instruments that we use. I would like mention once again that yesterday, at the alternative energy summit of the Group of the Progressive Alliance of Socialists and Democrats in the European Parliament, a five pillar concept was proposed for how we can answer these strategic questions, how we can reduce energy imports and energy wastage and, of course, how we can eliminate the negative impact on the environment. The proposed means for achieving this were through the development of renewable energies, through energy efficiency and through the use of information technology to interlink these different energy sources. That is an innovation summit. I have not heard of information technology being used as a strategic factor before. I therefore believe that we need a technological revolution, and this summit ought to be setting us on the right course. However, I have the impression that it is going in the wrong direction.

Madam President, I am pleased to be able to speak after my successor on the Committee on Constitutional Affairs, because I supported this project for 10 years and the European citizens’ initiative was included in the text of the treaty almost at the last second. Back then, it was the Members of this Parliament and of the national parliaments who took the initiative in the Convention. This opens a new chapter in the relationships between the citizens and the European institutions. All of us hope that this will reduce the distance between people and politics in Europe. The citizens’ initiative is not the cure for all our ills, but it can be a huge help. Above all, I would like to see more openness in Europe, in the form of a cross-border debate on current issues which are of interest to citizens. In my area, the environment, I can think of a number of subjects which could be put on the European Union’s agenda using this instrument and, in particular, on the agenda of the Commission in its role as European government or executive. I would also like to ask the Commission how it is preparing for these future initiatives. We must not disappoint the people. I would like to thank everyone and especially the rapporteurs Mrs Gurmai and Mr Lamassoure for their excellent work. Jo Leinen,

 Mr President, we would like to thank the Commission and the Council, Mrs Hedegaard and Mrs Schauvliege, for the daily briefings that the European Parliament delegation received in Cancún. We can truly say that, in Cancún, the EU was not part of the problem but, in many cases, was part of the solution. That should please all of us. The positive mood must now be utilised to bring new momentum to climate policy in Europe and also to the European Union. I would just like to mention three points. It was absolutely right for Parliament, in its resolution, to call for us to raise our ambitions and achieve a reduction in CO2
 of 30% by 2020, and I hope that the Commission and the Council will adopt decisions on this in the spring. Secondly, we have the Green Climate Fund. We proposed the introduction of a financial transaction tax to finance this. The people who rejected this must now come up with alternatives – we can no longer beat about the bush. Thirdly, we must do our homework. We must take the hot air out of the EU’s carbon footprint. My final point is this: This climate conference is done. Now let us look to the next one. The work must now be stepped up. Jo Leinen  (S&amp;D
). 
 – (DE) 
Mr President, Mrs Schauvliege, Commissioner, I am concerned that we are going from one extreme to the other. Prior to Copenhagen we were perhaps too ambitious, and now, ahead of Cancún, I am concerned that we are not being ambitious enough. I therefore think it is good that, in its resolution, Parliament addresses all the issues that we believe to be necessary for there to be progress and for us to achieve results even in Cancún. We have one major demand, and that is that the EU switch its strategy. Prior to Copenhagen, we made ourselves dependent on what was done in the United States and perhaps on what was done in China. That did not work there and it will not work in Cancún either. We should therefore take climate protection measures to protect our own interests. Hence the call by the majority in committee, and I hope in plenary tomorrow too, for us to increase our targets from 20% to 30%. That will be necessary during the course of the process in any case. We need to achieve this target at least before we go to South Africa. I also think that we are still on the wrong track with regard to Kyoto. Here too, we are relying on everyone else. I believe that our offer should be to establish Kyoto II. We will have no problem doing this; we will achieve it. Finally, with regard to the EU speaking with one voice: I saw how this worked in Nagoya. We had one microphone for the EU. Different people could speak, but they had to convey the same message. That is what I would like to see from the Council and the Commission in Cancún, too. Jo Leinen,  
on behalf of the S&amp;D Group.
 – (DE) 
Madam President, I hope that our Commissioner gets his voice back again, because we need a voice at the climate conference in Cancún. I had been rather surprised that Mrs Damanaki was speaking here on the revision of the hazardous substances directive after also speaking on the fisheries revisions; thank you for stepping into the breach. Parliament has not got everything that it wanted. Annex 3 has been dropped, which we regret. However, we will continue to keep an eye on these substances and when the revision takes place in three years’ time, you will have to come back to this House with your impact assessments and provide evidence of the problems that exist there on a substance-by-substance basis. We also have a considerable number of exemptions, so that it rather resembles a Swiss cheese. We also need to check here the gaps and shortcomings that exist as regards human health and the environment. I will simply say that solar panels were highly controversial. We want to keep cadmium out of the environment, but these panels put 100 000 tonnes of cadmium into the environment. That is something we will have to watch carefully. I am pleased that the Commission has made some concessions with its four statements, so for now, we will take what progress has been made in 2010 and we will meet again in three years’ time for the revision. Naturally, I would also like to thank the rapporteurs and shadow rapporteurs. Jo Leinen,

 Madam President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, the Gulf of Mexico has probably suffered one of the biggest environmental disasters of recent years, and we in Europe – in the European Union – must do everything we can to ensure that such a disaster cannot happen here. I believe we are in agreement on that. We have four seas adjoining the EU or situated within the EU: the North Sea, the Baltic Sea, the Mediterranean and the Black Sea. Oil drilling takes place in these European waters. In this regard, the subject is also an issue for the European Union. Deep-sea drilling especially represents a particular risk. That has become evident from the oil well in the Gulf of Mexico. There are problems here that are beyond our control. A great many outstanding questions have arisen to which we still do not have answers. Ladies and gentlemen, Commissioner, that is why we are recommending to you in our resolution that it would be appropriate to have a moratorium at least on new applications for deep-sea drilling until such time as we have a complete overview of what is needed and how we can close the gaps and remedy the shortcomings. I believe that the citizens of Europe expect us to ensure an equally high level of security for all 27 Member States, and thus for all four seas of the EU, and that there is no gap between countries that are already doing a lot – and that should be recognised – and those that are perhaps somewhat more lax in this area. I am also addressing our neighbouring countries here. We have a Neighbourhood Policy, and in the Mediterranean, in particular, there are, of course, also drillings by countries that are not members of the European Union. Commissioner Oettinger, I believe you are taking initiatives – and that is something you must indeed do – to talk to Libya in particular, but also to others, concerning our standards and our approaches. The question is: would the EU be prepared for such a disaster? What control mechanisms and intervention mechanisms do we have in the event of such a disaster? We need answers to this too. We have the agency in Lisbon, the European Maritime Safety Agency (EMSA), which was established in the aftermath of a disaster involving the break-up of supertankers. The agency thus checks the safety of vessels, but not the safety of the seas – in other words, precisely what we have now seen in respect of deep-sea drilling. In our opinion, it would be a good idea to expand EMSA’s mandate to allow these things also to come within its remit. That would at least address the problem adequately. I imagine that new resources would be needed for this. That is always a problem, of course. However, if we want to deal with such a major issue, then the resources will have to be found. I would also like to mention liability for such major events. What, in fact, is the insurance situation? What possibilities are there for getting the funds needed? We need to gain an overview of liability and insurance law relating to deep-sea drilling, and that is something we are discussing. Naturally we also, and above all, need to see how this applies to small companies operating in this field. Not all the companies active in this area are multinationals; there are many small companies too. How will they manage? How can they insure themselves? Do we need solidarity funds? Do we need collective solutions to ensure that those who suffer are compensated – the fishermen and others who are affected by such disasters? We also want to know whether the Environmental Impact Assessment Directive, which demands environmental impact assessments for activities on land, also applies to deep-sea drilling and related areas. There is much we do not know about the high seas. What kind of working conditions and social standards are effective there? After all, the human factor can also play a major role. We have good technology, but if the human factor fails, then it could result in such disasters. Commissioner, you have overall responsibility for energy. Offshore oil has its problems; offshore wind would be better. I believe that this debate naturally opens the way for a different energy policy in the EU – and that also lies within your remit.

 Mr President, Mr Tajani, ladies and gentlemen, along with industrial chemicals and agricultural chemicals, household chemicals represent the third large group of substances which are of significance for the environment and human health, and we are introducing rules covering these products in the biocide regulation. I believe that we have made significant progress since the old directive which dates back to 1998. Other speakers have already mentioned this. We are introducing a comprehensive regulation which applies not only to products manufactured in the EU, but also to imported products. This is very important. We are improving the labelling of these substances and, as Mr Jørgensen has said, we are calling for animal testing of these products to be replaced with alternative methods. We want to see animal tests reduced to a minimum or even abolished altogether in this area. In addition, we want particularly hazardous substances to be replaced with substances which are less dangerous. All of these measures represent progress and we can explain to the citizens of Europe that they will benefit human health and the environment. I was surprised about the level of disagreement as to whether or not the European Chemicals Agency (ECHA) in Helsinki should be responsible for monitoring and authorising these products. We want the same standards to apply throughout Europe and we want it to be possible for these products to be sold on the European market. For this reason, it is right that the ECHA takes responsibility for this area. I would like to ask Mr Tajani whether the ECHA has sufficient funding and the right organisation to be able to take on this task. My thanks go to Mrs Klaß and to the shadow rapporteurs for achieving a consensus on this subject. Jo Leinen,

 Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, I am not going to point the finger at any particular country, but I believe the finger is pointing back at all of us, because the EU strategy for 2010 has not worked and we need to think of new approaches for the new decade leading up to 2020. In a few weeks, the UN Conference of the Parties to the Convention on Biological Diversity will take place in Nagoya, and I hope that it will not be a similar disappointment to the UN Climate Change Conference in Copenhagen. At such an important global nature conservation conference, there simply must not be another failure, and the EU must play a major role in ensuring that is the case. We need to push for an ambitious global programme for the preservation of biodiversity. We must show solidarity in the financing of these measures, and the EU must speak with one voice and not 27 different ones. The Economics of Ecosystems and Biodiversity (TEEB) study has been mentioned. EUR 50 billion is lost each year as a result of species decline. In this case, 0.2% of financial resources from the EU budget for nature conservation is very meagre and paltry. In the medium-term financial programme, we simply must be provided with more money for the conservation of species. As far as the solidarity of the EU with the rest of the world is concerned, we also need an instrument that we can use to provide something in return for the species that we remove, particularly for medicinal plants. Developing countries need compensation. I also believe that the key to success lies in viewing biodiversity as a cross-cutting task. Agriculture, forestry, fisheries, marine exploitation – these now all need to be viewed from a species perspective. A soil protection directive will also gain a new importance. The soil is a buffer for CO2
, and changes to the soil represent a very negative scenario. Parliament will stand up for biodiversity. Congratulations to the rapporteur. Jo Leinen,  
on behalf of the S&amp;D Group.

Madam President, this disaster happened off the coast of the US, not the EU. It therefore affords us a real opportunity to learn some lessons and draw some conclusions. Mr Oettinger said that this is the second time we have discussed this issue. My committee has also held a major debate, and I am thankful to you that as soon as next week, together with the coordinators of the Committee on Industry, Research and Energy and the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Food Safety, we shall learn the results of your analysis, enabling us to continue our work into the summer recess. I would support you on the imposition of a moratorium on extreme drilling in Europe. We need to wait until we have identified the problems. I would also support your call for European standardisation, stringent safety standards and a European supervisory authority. As you have said, what we need is a system for auditing the auditors. I like this idea a lot. We would be happy to work on this. Mrs Damanaki, I liked what I heard from you: this disaster must spur us to change. The integrated maritime policy you have called for is a major project for the EU. I believe that harnessing the renewable energy of the sea, whether through deep-sea currents or other forms of retrieval that are yet to be invented, is a really key issue. I believe that the institutions, including the Council, have demonstrated a determination to prevent such a disaster in Europe, as has Parliament, and will be happy to cooperate with you in avoiding such an eventuality. Jo Leinen  (S&amp;D

 Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, a similar picture seems to be emerging from within all the groups. We had an interesting debate too on this regulation, which was also filled with controversy. However, the large majority of us feel that we will vote tomorrow with the rapporteur and give a clear signal to the Commission and Council. Commissioner, I believe that you said that we have a consensus. With novel foods, we need prior authorisation before they enter the market. I also explicitly agree that we need a central authorisation procedure and not different authorisation procedures in 27 Member States. This would not conform to the concept of the internal market and the uniformity of health and living conditions. We have new technologies entering the food market – as has already been mentioned in this Chamber – such as nanotechnology and GMOs. We are adopting a cautious approach in this House until we know all the facts and can be sure that our citizens can buy food which is totally safe in our supermarkets and then eat it afterwards. We are not calling for a ban on GMOs and nanomaterials. We want consumers to be given the freedom of choice or, in other words, a label indicating if these materials are contained in the food. I hope that during its cross-section debate on nanomaterials next week, the Commission will also reach a definition and perhaps a regulation so that we can have more material available about how we should handle nanomaterials. A great deal has already been said about meat from cloned animals. I would like you, Commissioner, to remove this section from the novel foods regulation. This would pave the way for a regulation on all the other topics which are not controversial. However, I would still call for a decision to be made about a separate regulation for meat from cloned animals before the conciliation procedure has ended, and to remove this from the novel foods regulation.

 Mr President, Commissioner Potočnik has thanked this Parliament emphatically for the fact that we have stayed so hard-headed with this legislative package, and that we have contributed to the big push forward that will now take place on the prevention of air pollution. The thanks for this must, of course, go to our rapporteur, Mr Krahmer, for his excellent work, but also to all the shadow rapporteurs and the others who stayed with us on this objective to make Europe’s air cleaner. The European Environment Agency has given us a report which shows that in some areas, we still have a bad situation as regards air pollution, nitrogen oxides and dust. Commissioner, you said it yourself. Now we hope that, with this new amendment, you will also have a tool for carrying out controls. We hope that you will also really implement this in a hard-headed manner and not accept any major exemptions or time wasting. After all, the previous directive dates from 1996 – that is, 14 years ago! I can understand the new Member States such as Poland and others, but I cannot understand the old Member States at all – the fact that in all these years, so little has been done, and the arguments that we hear again in this instance too, with regard to jobs and costs. Well, of course, these things always turn out badly; if we wait too long, then everything comes at once. If we do our work on time, then we can also carry out innovations and still protect jobs. Thus we have a great success, though it is spoiled somewhat by the large combustion plants. The small fry are arrested, while the big fish are allowed to go free. What happens so often in life is also unfortunately happening here with industrial plants. Jo Leinen,  
rapporteur for the opinion of the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Food Safety.

 Mr President, Mr Kallas, ladies and gentlemen, transport policy is of great importance when it comes to protecting both the environment and people’s health. It is good that the European Union has a strategy covering the period up to 2020 in order to resolve the many problems in current transport systems. We need to see a significant reduction in the environmental impact of road transport. We need genuine innovations in this area to reduce CO2
 emissions and also nitrogen oxides and fine particulates. In addition, we must integrate air and sea transport more closely into our environmental strategy. In particular, in the case of sea transport, sulphur and nitrogen oxide emissions are rising, and improvements are needed in this area. The increase in the noise produced by transport is also a nuisance for millions of people, which impacts on their quality of life. Improvements must be made in road transport, but also in rail and air transport. I would like to mention the internalisation of external costs. Company cars bring tax benefits and the airline industry does not pay excise duty on fuel, which means that we still have a great deal to do in this area. I would like to congratulate Mr Grosch on his excellent report. Jo Leinen,

 Madam President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, our group welcomes the statement by the Commission that we will fight to maintain the moratorium on commercial whaling. Now it is up to the Council to confirm this statement and, above all, to ensure that the 27 Member States speak with one voice. We cannot afford to delay this. We know from the meeting of the environment ministers that we do not have agreement here. There are some individual Member States that are pursuing different interests to the vast majority. Now that we have the Treaty of Lisbon, we ought to get used to the fact that we also speak with one voice in our foreign policy and in the representation of our values and interests in international organisations and not, as was the case in the past, each Member State for itself, which ultimately resulted in the weakening of Europe. We have seen this already at the CITES Conference. Here, our lack of agreement was ultimately a kind of powerlessness. We did not achieve what we wanted. I would not like this to continue in the International Whaling Commission. 2010 is the International Year of Biodiversity; in other words, the protection of ecosystems and threatened animal and plant species will be right at the centre of our efforts during these months. It would be a very bad sign if, in the Whaling Commission of all places, the moratorium was lifted and commercial whaling was permitted once again. We know that this animal species remains vulnerable. Our seas are becoming increasingly polluted and climate change will place yet another new strain on them. We therefore need to be very careful in our approach to this subject. The commercial interests of Japan, Iceland and Norway cannot take precedence here. Protection of this species and its ecosystems must determine our path. We are seeing the abuse of the concept of ‘scientific hunting’. Japan is clearly killing 900 whales a year in the Antarctic Ocean under the concept of ‘scientific whaling’. That is blatant abuse and I fully support the concerns of the Australian Government, which also no longer wants to permit this. We should do what the Commission has proposed in this regard. We call on the Council to create unity here so that we will speak with one voice at the forthcoming meeting of the International Whaling Commission. Jo Leinen,

 Mr President, we do not need to take a detour with regard to this vote. We can decide directly. The Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Food Safety has recommended that plenary bans the sticking together of separate pieces of meat and therefore does not allow thrombin to be used as an additive. A steak must be a steak and a ham must be a ham. I am sure that this is what the constituents of all the Members of this House want. Therefore, please vote in favour of our amendment not to include thrombin as an additive in our food regulation. Jo Leinen  (S&amp;D

 Mr President, the theme of the Lisbon Strategy was competitiveness and it was a very strongly one-sided economic strategy, which, of course, in part has failed. I am therefore very pleased that the theme of the EU 2020 strategy is now sustainability. That is the right way to go and it also involves a better balance between economic, social and environmental developments and needs. The disadvantage of sustainability is that it is a very general concept that can also lack substance. We therefore need to make it more specific. In this regard, the Commission’s paper is much too vague, as there are too many pieces of the picture missing to allow us to implement it. A resource-efficient Europe is the right approach – we have meagre energy reserves and meagre raw material reserves – but there is a lack of targets and instruments to bring us to this point of resource efficiency in our production and in our consumption. In this regard, I hope that by June we will have something rather more tangible and that we will know precisely what each of us has to do – what the Commission will do, what Parliament will do and what the Member States will have to do. In relation to this resource-efficient Europe, the environment seems to have been somewhat forgotten, because air, water, land and also ecosystems are resources too. That has been completely lost. I would therefore like to hear more from the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Food Safety in respect of what we want to do in this regard. The biodiversity strategy has failed. A new one has, of course, been drawn up to take us to 2020 and this point must be taken into account in this strategy. Climate protection has certainly been tossed about many times. I believe that we need to increase our reduction target from 20% to 30% and we need mandatory targets for energy efficiency. This is still too vague – we need to make it legally binding.

 Mr President, as if we had been able to predict what was going to happen, the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Food Safety, which is also responsible for civil protection, has an own-initiative report on the community approach to the prevention of natural disasters in the pipeline. The rapporteur is Mr Ferreira. We will be voting on this report in the next session and we will discuss our experience of the volcanic ash cloud then. Plenary will very soon be able to formulate Parliament’s position on these subjects. I agree with the Members who have said that we are poorly prepared for natural disasters. Fortunately, Europe has few natural disasters. However, we also have little experience in this area and it is clear that our crisis management is poor. In my opinion, it all took too long. Five days before a test flight took place and real data was collected is simply too long. We must learn from this. I do not want to make any accusations, but experience shows that we must do things better the next time around. If this volcanic ash has made one thing clear, it is the need for more Europe. Mr Kallas, you have said that the national authorities have responsibilities. However, this does not help the people who have suffered as a result. We need more Europe in civil protection and in a common transport policy. The Treaty of Lisbon opens up more opportunities for us. In the same way as Mrs Hübner, I would like to ask you how you will make use of the opportunities afforded by the Treaty of Lisbon in crisis management and civil protection. This situation must improve. Jo Leinen,  
rapporteur for the opinion of the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Food Safety.

 Madam President, Commissioner, the European Parliament has been waiting for this moment for a long time, namely for Parliament to be on an equal footing with the Council with respect to the control of legislative delegation. To illustrate this point: in 2008, there were 6 000 delegated acts, in other words, a huge mountain of standards, which were turned into a kind of secondary legislation by the Commission and the old comitology procedure. Parliament had very few rights in this process. We were informed, but we were not colegislators. The Treaty of Lisbon has now changed that. With regard to the control of delegated acts, we are on an equal footing with the Council, and we also want to utilise our equal standing to the full. That means, Commissioner, that when you argue that the urgency procedure is possible, then we will also need to receive information at as early a stage as possible. We want to receive information as early as the Council receives it. Jo Leinen  (S&amp;D

 Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, the Greek crisis is a current problem, while the growth crisis and the environmental crisis are long-term problems, and both need to be tackled dynamically with decisions taken by the European Council. The Europe 2020 strategy rightly states that growth should be intelligent, sustainable and inclusive. When I look at the Council’s conclusions, however, I see that they are much more narrowly focused and reduced to the classical growth strategy – a strategy that has failed and that did not get us very far. Growth cannot be intelligent if it is not sustainable and it is also not intelligent if it is not inclusive. That is why I would like to ask the Council and the Presidency of the Council to ensure that this triad, these three pillars, are retained. This is the new development that really should be implemented now. I am very pleased that growth that saves on resources and on energy is to be a flagship of the European Union. Of course, we have been talking about this for a long time. This will actually help us to save costs, reduce dependencies and solve a series of problems. I expect the Commission to provide us with a roadmap in the course of 2010, as it is a shared responsibility of the EU itself but also of the Member States, and many areas are therefore on very soft ground and very vague. Above all, we must make the target of 20% energy savings binding. This efficiency target must thus be made legally binding so that everyone knows where things are headed and industry can also realise the relevant investment. Jo Leinen  (S&amp;D

 A very warm welcome to Parliament, Commissioner. I wrote a letter to the President of Parliament to inform him that all of the delegations in this House have climate protection on the agenda in our discussions with our partners throughout the world. We need to find another mechanism to enable this information and these results to be linked in with your travels around the world so that those of us here in Brussels and Strasbourg know exactly where we stand. I am rather concerned that the climate negotiations could suffer the same fate as the Doha negotiations, which are constantly being postponed year after year. My question is, therefore, what is your plan B in order, perhaps, to achieve results in parts of some sectors? I also have a question concerning the Kyoto Protocol. One strategic error we made in Bangkok was to give the impression that we would abandon it. What would happen if we do not adopt something until 2011 or 2012? What is the future for the Kyoto Protocol? Jo Leinen  (S&amp;D

Mr President, Commissioner, welcome to Parliament. I would like to join my fellow Member, Mr Schnellhardt, by saying you have a major task in this area, to create genuinely equal conditions in the 27 Member States by 2010 so that household pets can be transported and brought from one country to another without obstacles. Free movement for dogs and cats was certainly the goal of the 2003 regulation. Now, for the third time, we are making an exception. In the EU, some things take a really long time: ten years to tune such regulations. No country in the EU wants diseases to be introduced and I also wonder why 22 countries accept the idea of dogs and cats being allowed to travel with their owners and five countries do not. You should examine whether the reality and the obstacles still correspond to these special provisions. I know that there are thorny debates at national level, but we are now one legal space and it is time, by 2011 at the latest, to introduce free movement, the single market for pets. The animal expert, Mr Schnellhardt, has already mentioned the conditions, namely that there is a vaccination card and that instruments like electronic tagging will be used, which will then give you access to the five countries when you are on holiday or travelling to work and wish to take your pets with you. This regulation on pets will go down in history. It is, in fact, the first legal act since the Treaty of Lisbon and we wanted a level playing field with the Council of Ministers in the empowerment of the Commission for delegated acts. That was an uphill struggle, but it was worth it. My congratulations to Mrs De Brún for this report and, of course, for this procedure to begin a new era. That is why it is so important, because we have perhaps a hundred legal acts in a year, but 6 000 delegated acts, and from this we can gauge how important it is to set the new procedure on the right track from the beginning.

 Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, following the disappointing conclusion to the climate conference in Copenhagen, Parliament is using this resolution to make it clear that there is no alternative to climate protection and that, as we move towards the next conference in Mexico, we must increase rather than decrease our efforts in this area. I shall be brief. Amendment 6 from the Group of the Progressive Alliance of Socialists and Democrats in the European Parliament was intended to serve this purpose. However, as it has been worded confusingly, we are withdrawing it. Nevertheless, we do support Amendments 1 and 9 from the Group of the Alliance of Liberals and Democrats for Europe and the Group of the Greens/European Free Alliance, which call on the EU to do more en route to Mexico. Climate protection must not come to a standstill. I would ask for your support. Jo Leinen,

Madam President, Madam President-in-Office of the Council, Mr Samecki, 2010 is the International Year of Biodiversity and the EU is about to press ahead with a new strategy for biodiversity, in other words, for the protection of flora and fauna within the area of the European Union. It would greatly enhance the credibility of the European Union if we were also to work on an international level to protect endangered flora and fauna globally and to give this our support. There will be an opportunity for this next month at the 15th Conference of the Parties to the Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species of Wild Fauna and Flora (CITES) in Doha. The EU must make itself a champion for all species which, as a result of various different factors, but in particular, over-exploitation or destructive and illegal practices, are endangered or even threatened with extinction. The Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Food Safety has debated this issue in detail and will table a proposal for a recommendation in plenary tomorrow, and we would be very pleased if the Council and the Commission were able to endorse these recommendations. Due to the time constraints, I will just mention a few example species which, in our opinion, are in need of a high or an even higher level of protection. Firstly, there is the African Elephant. We are most definitely opposed to the downlisting of this animal from Appendix I to Appendix II. The prohibition of international trade, particularly in ivory, must remain in place. Secondly, there is the Asian tiger. It is now on the brink of extinction, and we are demanding stricter protection regulations for many parties to the Convention, in particular to prevent the illegal trade in the body parts and derivatives of the tiger. We know that there is a large market for tiger bones and components of the tiger in Asia and this is threatening the existence of this animal. Thirdly, there is the protection of the polar bear. Climate change is threatening to destroy the habitat of this species and there is also an increase in trade in the body parts of polar bears. We are therefore in favour of uplisting the polar bear from Appendix II to Appendix I. I would also like to mention the protection of various species of shark. Various shark species are being over-fished, in particular the porbeagle and the spiny dogfish, but other shark species are also affected by this. Up to this point, there is consensus among us. I now come to the controversial issue. The source of the controversy is the classification of the Atlantic bluefin tuna, which is found in the Mediterranean and the Atlantic. Ladies and gentlemen, we are aware of the recommendations of the ad-hoc working group of the FAO, which wants to leave the Atlantic bluefin tuna in Appendix II. However, we are also aware of the proposal by the CITES scientific committee, which wants to uplist the Atlantic bluefin tuna to Appendix I. The background to this proposal is the data which reveals what is happening with this species. The stocks of Atlantic bluefin tuna declined by 75% between 1957 and 2007, and in the last ten years alone, there has been a decline of 60.9%. The risk to this fish is increasing and gaining momentum and therefore, the vast majority of us in the committee were of the opinion that this species should be included in Appendix I. This means that there will only be restrictions and prohibitions on international fishing fleets, not local fishing. Thus, the small, local fishermen can continue to catch this fish, and the preservation of the fish in the ecosystem is, in any case, more important than the general availability of sushi and sashimi. That is the conflict that we face. We need to take a long-term view and should provide proper protection for the Atlantic bluefin tuna in Appendix I. Jo Leinen  (S&amp;D

 Mr President, Mrs Espinosa, last week I attended the Informal Environment Council meeting in Seville. It was the first Council configuration under the Spanish Presidency. You were, of course, unable to attend due to an unfortunate family matter, but your Secretary of State, Teresa Ribera, did a splendid job of representing you. Throughout the meeting, which was extremely well organised, the commitment of the Spanish Presidency to the matter was evident. That is all well and good, but the result of this Council meeting was not very satisfactory. The Council of Ministers was divided, with a complete lack of direction. There is absolutely no agreement among Member States about what we should do now. That is not a good sign. It is your job and your responsibility to find the common denominator among the 27 Member States. In my opinion, we need to do three things in the European Union following Copenhagen. The first is that we must regain the leading role in global climate protection. Secondly, we need to show credibility in the commitments that we have made and, thirdly, we urgently need to gain new partners before we get to Mexico. With regard to regaining the leading role, I agree with everyone here who said that we should continue to state our promise to reduce carbon emissions by 30%. I would like to see us specify this 30% target to the UN Secretariat in Bonn on 31 January, not the old 20% target. If we make ourselves dependent on comparable efforts by others, it will take forever and Mexico will also come to nothing. In terms of showing credibility, the EUR 7.2 billion must actually be realised before Mexico. The countries in Africa need to be able to see that the first measures are already in progress. Finally, with regard to gaining partners, I hope that we will develop climate protection diplomacy and, with the help of the African Union in particular, that we will also find sufficient partners, including in Latin America and Asia, for a global agreement in Mexico.

 Mr President, an official delegation is representing Parliament in Copenhagen. You will also be attending and, for the first time, we do not have to rent an office in the city. Instead, we will have an official presence in the EU pavilion. This is good and we are grateful. Therefore, Article 61 is not needed. The Treaty of Lisbon ensures not only that Parliament will be listened to with regard to international treaties, but also that it has to agree to them. This is the beginning of a new era for us and, therefore, we are asking, in accordance with Article 60, to be admitted to the EU coordination meetings and not to be left standing outside the door. The Commission must treat us in the same way as it does the Council when it provides information about treaty negotiations and we are asking it to begin with the Kyoto agreement. This is our request to the Commission. Perhaps Mrs Reding would like to say something on this subject. (Applause) Jo Leinen,

 Mr President, Mr President-in-Office of the Council, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, in recent years, the European Parliament has been a driving force in the debate on climate protection, and we have also achieved a large percentage of the EU’s climate protection package. The resolution that we are putting forward today has all the elements for an ambitious agreement in Copenhagen. Yet what we are proposing is also realistic. It is both ambitious and realistic at the same time, and we hope that the Council and the Commission will join forces with us to form a single lobbying body at the conference in order to get other partners on board. The EU has taken on the leadership role in these issues and we want that to remain the case in Copenhagen. We must therefore stand by our offer of a 30% reduction in CO2
 by 2020. The science tells us that we need to be in the upper end between 25% and 40%. 30% would therefore still not be enough, we know that, and that is why we must actually offer this target, as it will drive up the ambition of other countries. We know that global climate protection is not possible without financing. In contrast to the Council, Parliament has given specific figures in this regard. The global framework is around EUR 100 billion, and Europe needs to take on around a third of that. So why do we not say that we will provide EUR 30 billion in 2020? Parliament has committed itself to this and I hope that the Council and the Commission will be equally specific in two weeks time. Mrs Wortmann-Kool has already mentioned the kick-start. We need EUR 5 to 7 billion straight away. When I look at how much money we made available for the banking crisis, we are really talking about peanuts to overcome the climate crisis – and there will be no second chance at this. Once the climate has been broken, it will be broken forever and we will not be able to fix it. This really has to deserve a major effort from us all, therefore. I also note that some countries are moving, but others are not. It must not be the case that the two greatest climate polluters, China and the United States, play a giant game of ping-pong where each accuses the other whilst dragging its own feet. That is irresponsible and I hope that the US, in particular, will also show leadership in Copenhagen, with specific information on reductions in its own climate-change gases and also a share of the financing. Without these two countries and without India, there will be no agreement. We emphasise forestry policy once again – deforestation is a major factor – as well as aviation and maritime transport. If railways are included in the emissions trading and have to pay, I can no longer see why aviation and maritime transport should have such special privileges. At long last, Parliament will be represented in the EU pavilion for the first time. That is a new beginning, and I hope we are able to take part in the briefing between the Council and the Commission since, under the Treaty of Lisbon, we have joint legislative power on the Copenhagen agreement.

 Mr President, the demand from Václav Klaus for an addition to the Charter of Fundamental Rights is both arbitrary and superfluous. However, it is easy to oppose, because the charter refers only to EU law and applies only to the future. Therefore, if necessary, the Council should make a political declaration. In a few weeks, the ratification of the treaty, which we have been waiting nine years for, should then take place. The European Council must make the necessary preparations, but should not jump to any hasty conclusions. This applies also to the European External Action Service. The High Representative is responsible for proposing a concept for the service, not the Council bureaucracy. I would therefore ask the Council Presidency to ensure that the service is not in a position off to one side, but can integrate itself into the community system, as Mr Barroso has said. This treaty gives us the legal basis for a common energy policy and for a common climate protection policy. I can only hope that the fog lifts before Copenhagen, because we must not leave these questions open until the conference. The Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Food Safety has made clear demands, including with regard to financing. I hope that there will be agreement on a financing concept next week at the summit. Furthermore, we need internal burden-sharing within the EU. Germany and other countries must give way, as we need a fair deal both within the EU and between the EU and the developing countries throughout the world. Jo Leinen,

Madam President, Commissioner Olli Rehn has praised this Parliament for its activities in bringing about the climate protection package and, in fact, we aim to continue to be ambitious. Last night, the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Food Safety voted 55-1 in favour of adopting a resolution that sets high targets for the negotiations in Copenhagen. This result shows that the denial of climate change, the ignorance of these matters, is represented by a vanishingly small minority of individuals here in this House whose views really should be disregarded and who have made their views known here on a number of occasions, but who are actually swimming against the tide of opinion of the citizens of all the countries of the European Union. It makes no difference to the Earth’s atmosphere where the CO2
 comes from. That means that we need a global agreement for every country and not – as is already being argued in Bangkok – multiple agreements, with one for the US, one for Europe and one for the developing countries – that would be disastrous. We need a global pact against climate change and that means that we also need a global pact of solidarity of the rich countries with the poor ones. This point has already been made many times. Climate change represents an opportunity for us and also for the developing countries to set in motion low-carbon development with new technologies, together with the modernisation of the infrastructure. Europe must help this come about. When it comes to funding, we have endorsed the demand that the EU needs EUR 30 billion by 2020 and that we must develop funding tools that are durable and predictable. They must not simply be dependent on funds from the budget, but must also have other sources of funding. I want to stress, once again, that marine transport and aviation must be included and that, of course, the forests and agriculture have their own, significant share. Development and climate protection are not opposites – rather, they must be brought together into a synthesis in Copenhagen. Jo Leinen  (S&amp;D

 Mr President, after eight years and many debates and negotiations, there is a real chance now that this Reform Treaty will enter into force, thanks also to the hard work of many people in this House who were committed to this project from beginning to end in the Convention and later in the intergovernmental conferences. I believe that Parliament has played a constructive part in this Reform Treaty. I think that, if the constitutional court in Prague in the Czech Republic gives a positive ruling, there will no longer be any legal grounds for President Klaus to block the EU any further. The other constitutional bodies in the Czech Republic will also find ways to overcome any such illegal blockade. We are, of course, hearing that there is a new threat of trouble from the United Kingdom. However, if a British Government were to allow a referendum, then it would not be on the Treaty of Lisbon but on whether the British people are in favour of the EU or whether they want to pull out of Europe. That would have to be the subject of the referendum and not a treaty that has been ratified. That would be totally unacceptable. I think we need to learn something from this, and that is that our citizens need more information. I therefore hope that, in the new Commission, we will also get a vice-president for communication and for information and perhaps even a commissioner for European citizenship. That would be the answer to these controversies on European policy. Jutta Haug  (S&amp;D

Mr President, Commissioners, ladies and gentlemen, the extraordinary meeting of the European Council is now imminent and we are talking ourselves to a standstill in an effort to achieve harmony. The extraordinary meeting has one sole purpose: to develop the Council’s mandate for the negotiations on the multiannual financial framework. As part of the preparations, two inter-related negotiating boxes have been produced. To put it bluntly, we are not satisfied, and we cannot possibly be satisfied with what has been presented. We are also annoyed, to put it mildly, by the Council’s conduct on budgetary issues, which can be described in one word: irresponsible! We can only repeat what we said in June last year, namely that we need a proper system of own resources which is worthy of the name. The Commission has taken a first small step, but this is not enough. There is almost nothing we need more urgently than these genuine own resources, for they would mean that the European budget would no longer be dependent on national contributions. We need this independence to put an end to this untenable situation. There would also be no further logic to the arguments being advanced in some Member States. As Mr Reul has just said, the debate there is only ever about payments, contributions and spending. They never discuss political priorities, their priorities. They never tell us what they would like to achieve with the European budget. No ideas are forthcoming about the future of the European Union. The Council is not acting like a European institution. Instead, it has become a collection of 27 sets of national self-interest, where they all bicker like children  The budget is like a pie, and yes, there should be pie, but they squabble over which ingredients they should provide and how big their slice of the pie should be. Everyone wants to eat and no one wants to bake. It is appalling! Jutta Haug  (S&amp;D
).  
– (DE) 
Madam President, Commissioners, ladies and gentlemen, the next multiannual financial framework and the amount of funding and the policies we want to finance are the focus of our discussions and disagreements here as we seek to reach a consensus, but this is only one side of the coin, namely the expenditure side. However, we must work on the other side of the coin as well, namely the revenue side. That is nothing new. For almost 20 years, the European Parliament has been calling for a more transparent, fairer and simpler system of own resources. Now, for the first time, we can lend weight to this demand.  In the SURE report last June, we called for a system of own resources which would abolish all of the rebates and make the revenue side of the EU budget completely independent of the contributions made by Member States. The Commission took account of these demands, at least to some extent, by proposing a reform of own resources from valued added tax and the introduction of a Financial Transaction Tax. We support this proposal by the Commission, even though it only amounts to a 40 % reform. It is at least a step forward, and what is more, it moves in the right direction.  The European Union has won the Nobel Peace Prize. This was intended to be an expression of gratitude but also an incentive to go further. A more peaceful approach could also be achieved if the constant bean-counting between the net contributors and the net recipients were consigned to the past following a reform of the revenue system. A genuinely European revenue stream would also highlight the European value added of the EU budget. Then this constant small-minded national bean-counting could finally stop. Jutta Haug,

Mr President, President of the Council, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, the Committee on the Environment would like to remind you that, although it is responsible only for an infinitesimal part of the European budget, we will certainly not achieve the aims of the Europe 2020 strategy if we do not commit sufficient appropriations to the programmes and measures relating to environment and climate action and biodiversity. That is why we have reinstated the totally incomprehensible cuts the Council made to the Commission proposal. After all, the Commission did also subscribe to the commitment to sustained growth. In any case, the Commission was already being very cautious when it drew up the budget. It provided for a rise of no more than 0.72 % for climate and environment policy. In plain words, that simply means a cut. For the inflation rate is in fact 2 %. Even more dubious is what the Council is doing with the agencies. Let us make it quite clear: the Commission has already included the minus 1 % for staff in its proposal, and, moreover, it is as usual also reducing the appropriations the agencies regard as necessary. That means the available budget for the agencies is pretty low from the outset. And then the Council comes along and snips away at it even more. Soon we will be down to the bare bones! This most affects the agencies to which the legislator, i.e. the Council and the EP together, have transferred new tasks. They cannot fulfil them if they do not receive adequate funding. We expect the Commission to produce a supplementary and rectifying budget as soon as possible in any case and at all events. We expect the Council to take on board our good arguments when it negotiates with Parliament. We know that the Council is incorruptible, but surely it can at least see reason! Jutta Haug  (S&amp;D
).

 Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, in unity, strength. That is what they say. We ought not to be wasting our energy among ourselves, therefore, because the vast majority of us – Parliament, Council and Commission – are in agreement: Europe needs growth, and Europe needs jobs. How, then, can we put this unity of analysis into action? That is where the European budget comes into play – the common budget that is a budget for investment with no compulsion for consolidation, because it has no debts. A European budget with adequate funds, an innovative structure and the necessary flexibility is quite simply our common instrument for leveraging existing growth potential in Europe, opening up new prospects and maintaining our position in the global competition for talent, technologies and market leadership. The common European budget represents our joint European opportunity, our added value. That cannot be that hard to grasp; even the Council can do so. Jutta Haug,  
rapporteur for the opinion of the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Food Safety.

 Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, the Committee on the Environment is responsible for the budget lines for the environment, public health and food safety, and controls 0.76% of the Union’s budget. Overall, we were very pleased with the implementation rates. A full 99.26% of resources are tied up in the environment and climate change sector, while the figure in the LIFE programme, our flagship and our only financial instrument for the environment, was 99.4%. The rate was also above 99% in the health sector too. All the available information leads us to the recommendation that the Commission should be granted discharge. I have been dealing with agencies in various capacities for seven and a half years. These seven and a half years have taught me that it is the decentralised agencies that do the lion’s share of the work in Europe, fulfilling the tasks assigned to them by the legislators, Parliament and Council under the ordinary legislative procedure. For seven and a half years, I have seen how the agencies are under particularly close public scrutiny. More than ever before, the specialist committees are particularly rigorous in exercising political control over the agencies. We want to know what staff in the agencies do, how they do it, and what happens with the resources from the Community budget. The agencies’ budgets are not arbitrarily organised in the budgetary process, nor are the agencies absolved of responsibility in the discharge process. However, during these seven and a half years, I have never experienced so many half-truths, insinuations and misinformation being used to create an atmosphere of distrust and suspicion towards the agencies and the people working in them during the discharge process. This is not worthy of the working practices normally followed in this House. This fatal combination is the reason why the Committee on Budgetary Control has applied to defer the discharge for three agencies, the Medicines Agency, the Environment Agency and the Food Safety Authority. Of course, I support criticism of excessively high carry-overs to the next year and of the extremely high cost of governing body meetings. However, these issues do not justify the deferral of the discharge. Speaking from my seven and a half years of experience working with agencies, I can only recommend that our decision in relation to granting discharge should not be based on an unholy mix of half-truths, misinformation and insinuations. With all the information available to us, we can confidently grant discharge to all agencies without exception. Jutta Haug,  
rapporteur for the opinion of the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Food Safety

 Mr President, Mr Dominik, Mr Lewandowski, ladies and gentlemen, let us not be under any illusions. We are in the same position in the budget process for 2012 that we find ourselves in every year: faced by a Council that does not understand the issues. As always, the Council has cut the appropriations for the Commission, even the not very large amount for the environment and climate change, for public health and for food and feed safety. Together with the four agencies, this amounts to just under EUR 1 billion, in other words, all of 0.67% of the EU budget. Therefore, we are very pleased that the Committee on Budgets has complied with all our requests and has restored the funding from the draft budget in all cases. At this point I would like to give my warm congratulations to the rapporteur. Ms Balzani has done an excellent job. We are also pleased that the package which has been negotiated includes seven pilot projects and three preparatory actions from the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Food Safety. We have never been as successful as this in the past. All that remains now is for us all, together with the Council – and perhaps it will work – to ensure that good results for the citizens of Europe come out of the negotiations. Jutta Haug  (S&amp;D

 Madam President, Mr Barroso, Mr Dowgielewicz, the Commission’s legislative proposal has been described by Mr Barroso as ambitious, but realistic and sensible. Having listened to the dismissive and highly critical reactions from various capital cities in our wonderful European Union, it would be easy to believe this. However, if you read the proposal, which is what Parliament does, unlike many areas of government and the large majority of journalists, you get the very clear impression that the time when the Commission was regarded as the engine of European integration and development is finally over. The Commission has failed to meet Parliament’s expectations with regard to the structure of the budget, levels of spending and the extent of the reform of the own resources system. To give one example of revenues, Parliament has said that we want our budget to be based entirely on own resources as laid down in the Treaty. Therefore, we aim to replace the transfers from the Member States completely. At the same time, we want to bring an end to all rebates. What does the Commission do? It proposes replacing less than half of the Member States’ contributions with real own resources and no longer calculating the rebates, but simply applying a flat rate. Well, my goodness! It would have been better if we had at least reached this point only as the result of long negotiations between Parliament and the Council, as a compromise achieved, as far as I am concerned, with the help of the Commission. We in Parliament had hoped that the Commission, as the champion of a Europe-centric policymaking approach, would be on our side during the negotiations with the Council, but now we are anticipating the inevitable discussions with very mixed feelings. Jutta Haug  (S&amp;D

 Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, a year ago, the plenary agreed and mandated a special committee to draft the position of the European Parliament in relation to the next financial perspective. Now, following exactly eleven months of work, the Policy Changes Committee is presenting the fruits of its labours. This was a task that required discipline and concentration and that could only be achieved by adopting an approach characterised by openness, solidarity and mutual trust. For that, let me express my sincerest gratitude to those Members involved in the creative process. The report we have produced, drawn up under the leadership of Mr Garriga Polledo, is a genuinely good result. It is something of which we can be proud. However, as we all know, good results require not just hard-working Members, but also excellent staff. We certainly had this, not just in the shape of our personal assistants and our group staff, but also, above all, in an excellent secretariat. This super team, led by Monika Strasser, was not just competent and professional, but was also more than usually interested in its work. It was patient and creative, extremely well organised, and, at the same time, spontaneous and flexible. Best of all, it was always cheerful and open. They obviously enjoyed all the hard work. I would like to thank this nine-strong team from the bottom of my heart. Thank you very much indeed. (Applause)
 From the outset, Mr Garriga Polledo and I wanted to deliver a report that could be supported by three quarters of Parliament. We actually received a majority of more than four fifths in the vote in committee. We were very pleased with this. Our call for a seven-year financial perspective which is expressed in a structure that reflects the objectives of the Europe 2020 strategy, while, at the same time, respecting all the policies for the European Union and avoiding increasing the European budget to unrealistic levels, must be seen to be reasonable. It is realistic and achievable. Our report contains 174 paragraphs, all of them arguments for more Europe. We genuinely need more Europe. Please read the report. It offers the best basis for convincing our citizens in local debate and for entering into serious negotiations with the Council, which is unfortunately notable by its absence today. Thank you for your excellent work. Jutta Haug,

 Madam President, President-in-Office of the Council, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Food Safety has expressed a very positive opinion to the Committee on Budgetary Control. We were very pleased with how the funds had been implemented by the Commission services. We have no criticisms to make, either as regards the way in which the funds were spent or as regards the level of expenditure. On the contrary, we have nothing but praise for the prompt and positive use of the funds in the LIFE programme. The Commission has succeeded in spending the additional funding that we granted and in doing so usefully. The agencies in our area – the European Environment Agency (EEA), the European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control (ECDC), the European Chemicals Agency (ECA), the European Food Safety Authority (EFSA) and the European Medicines Agency (EMA) – have also managed their money responsibly. In contrast to the competent committee, the Committee on Budgetary Control criticises the European Medicines Agency in its report and even wishes to refuse discharge for this agency. I think that is going too far, to put it politely. If I were being less polite I might say that the Committee on Budgetary Control is interfering in matters outside its sphere of competence. It should please stop doing so. I can only ask Parliament and plenary to improve matters in this respect. Jutta Haug  (S&amp;D
),  
in writing. 
– Though not very ambitious, the first reading compromise improves the current legislation – I therefore voted in favour. Besides the new methodology for substance restrictions, one key improvement is the open scope: all electric and electronic equipment, including equipment for the generation of electric currents, will in the medium term fall under the RoHS legislation. A major drawback, however, is the long list of exclusions, including photovoltaic panels. Excluding this decisive ‘clean’ technology from environmental legislation will send the wrong signal, EU-wide and globally. This is about setting the right regulatory framework for coherent sustainable investments! Even if the production of photovoltaic panels with hazardous substances like cadmium telluride might be more cost-efficient, less problematic alternatives have existed for a long time and have proved to function excellently. I do not see any need, therefore, to cover our roofs and fields with potentially hazardous waste, shifting the disposal challenge to future generations. On this point, I strongly disagree with the position and decision of the EP’s and Council’s majority. Jutta Haug,

 Mr President, Mr Wathelet, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, as rapporteur for the opinion of the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Food Safety regarding the budget, I will not be telling anyone here present anything new. Nevertheless, I would like to point out once again that the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Food Safety is responsible for less than 1% of the budget as a whole, less than 1% of all environmental protection actions, biodiversity actions and actions in the fight against climate change. It is responsible for the whole area of public health, for food and feed safety, and for veterinary measures, as well as for the extremely important work of five European agencies. 1%! Well, in that case, it is certainly not possible to talk of excessive quantities of money. This small amount of money is therefore desperately needed for carrying out our work. It will therefore be no surprise to anyone that we are unable to accept the Council’s cuts. We need the resources. Jutta Haug  (S&amp;D
). 
 – (DE) 
Mr President, Commissioner, I will say right at the outset that I think it is a good document that we have before us here. It is balanced, as Mr Lewandowski has always promised us – balanced with a large number of suggestions and ideas for how we can, and should, continue to work. However, it is not what we as budget specialists in the Committee on Budgets expected. To be honest, we thought there would be an analysis of the current financial framework, and the real optimists even believed that we might also get a small revision for the remaining period of the current financial perspective. However, what we have before us now is purely a glance into the future. Almost every other section mentions how we should do things better in future with regard to our budget, whether in relation to our priorities, how to achieve the goals of the Europe 2020 strategy, better cooperation with our neighbours, better European infrastructure or our future agricultural policy and cohesion policy. This paper even presents ideas with regard to the future structure of our budget and the length of the next financial period. (The President cut off the speaker) Jutta Haug,  
rapporteur for the opinion of the Committee on Budgets.
 – (DE)
 Mr President, Mr Wathelet, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, our two rapporteurs have already provided an evaluation of the Council’s position, and now it is my turn to speak on behalf of the Committee. I would like to say right at the start that I am certain that the Belgian Presidency will do as good a job as it possibly can. However, it can only do its job as well as it is permitted to do by the Council as a whole. Unfortunately, we have to admit that, in this regard, the result is poor. The Council has, as usual – and I cannot remember things ever being any different – gone round busily deleting and cutting parts of the Commission’s draft, in terms of both the commitments and the payments. It has done this all over the place at random – and that is also the usual procedure. It has not looked to see where this could possibly make sense and where not. The result is more than EUR 780 million less in commitments and EUR 3.6 billion less in payments. If we look at who this affects in particular, we see that once again, it is the decentralised agencies. We established these agencies together by means of legislation. Both Parliament and the Council were involved, otherwise there would be no agencies. However, if we do not make available to them the funds they need to enable them to do exactly what we have tasked them with doing, we ought to shut them down. Otherwise, every euro we give them really is money down the drain. The same thing applies to the executive agencies. The Commission has already mentioned this. If we bleed dry the executive agencies that are supposed to implement the multiannual programmes that have been decided by law, these programmes are finished. Do we really want that to happen? Elements in the Council hold pious speeches about how Europe must make greater efforts to be, or to become, competitive. In the budget procedure, however, it is precisely those parts of the budget that are intended to promote growth and competitiveness that are being cut, in other words, category Ia. The structural policy figures are being affected in a similar way. Where there are now real requirements for funds from the regions, funding is being reduced by EUR 1 billion. That can hardly be regarded as logical, and it is certainly not wise. We would really like those with the political responsibility to look closely at the content of our budget – the content! – and, in so doing, to have Europe and its added value for citizens in mind and in sight. Then they will indeed find a suitable partner for discussion in us. Jutta Haug  (S&amp;D

Madam President, it is a little unusual, but I must inform my own group that our voting list for the Trüpel report is not correct in the form that we have laid it down. There has been a misunderstanding. We reject all the amendments, except our own. Jutta Haug,  
rapporteur for the opinion of the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Food Safety. 
– (DE)
 Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I would just like to address one point, a point that really is a scandal. I am talking about the European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control, the ECDC in Stockholm. Since May 2005, highly qualified people there have had to work in an absolutely hostile environment. Until now, the Swedish Government has been unable to conclude an accord de siege
 with the ECDC, although they desperately wanted this agency, like all Member States always badly want an agency. To this day, none of the employees have a personal identity number, the so-called Folkbokföring
 number. However, this number is used by public administrations, institutions and private companies to identify their customers. Consequently, children born in Sweden cannot be registered, for example, providers of electricity, gas, telecommunications and television withhold their services, landlords refuse long-term tenancy agreements and there are problems accessing doctors and hospitals. For spouses, it means it is impossible to become self-employed in Sweden. There are also enormous difficulties in getting a job. The list could go on. One thing is clear: certain fundamental rights anchored in European law are simply being denied to the staff at the ECDC in Sweden. As a result, all of this has landed before our Committee on Petitions. In any case, the situation is untenable …. (The President cut off the speaker) Jutta Haug,  
rapporteur.
 – (DE) 
Mr President, Mr President-in-Office of the Council, Commissioner, when we debated this year’s budget in December of last year, we were already aware and, as general rapporteur for the 2009 budget, I mentioned in the discussion that the impact of the financial market crisis and its repercussions on the real economy would be felt in all the Member States. This is exactly what has happened. In April 2009, Parliament and the Council agreed on the funding for the first part of the economic stimulus proposed by the Commission. In order to make the EUR 2.6 billion available, we needed what was referred to as a minor revision of the financial perspective. How would we have been able to find the funds otherwise, given our tight budgetary constraints? The remaining EUR 2.4 billion, which was missing from the total of EUR 5 billion, was to be found this autumn. This is where we are now. Autumn is here and, because Parliament and the Council have come to a sensible arrangement on the 2010 budget, we have a solution. The 2009 budget is also making a significant contribution to this solution. The 2010 supplementary and amending budget cuts the payment appropriations by more than EUR 3.4 billion. In line with this, the margins of the unused areas under the different headings will be reduced by almost EUR 1.5 billion. All of this applies to the 2009 budget, which consists of EUR 133.8 billion in commitment appropriations and EUR 116.1 billion in payment appropriations, and is therefore not exactly on a lavish scale. If we take a look at the budget lines where the Commission found the necessary money, it becomes abundantly clear that the Commission simply does not take the budgetary authority’s resolutions seriously. I would like to remind Parliament that in 2008, when we adopted the 2009 budget, our priorities were also the competitiveness of the European Union, growth and employment. This is why we allocated more money than proposed by the Commission to budget lines which promoted the social dimension by creating more and better jobs and supporting small and medium-sized enterprises. However, it is precisely these budget lines which are being plundered for transfers or amending budgets. Would it be asking too much to call on the Commission to implement the resolutions of Parliament and the Council and to make an effort to ensure that the money reaches its intended destinations where it will have a positive impact? The draft budget submitted to us by the Commission has not been accurately calculated or carefully estimated. In 2009, we had more than 50 transfers and 10 supplementary and amending budgets. It is not possible to talk about budgetary accuracy and clarity in this context and this situation must improve. Our fellow Members in the specialist committees must pay greater attention to the implementation reports in the course of the financial year and the Commission must finally live up to the good reputation that it still has of being an effective European administrative body. I hope that we will all work towards this. Jutta Haug,  
rapporteur.

 Mr President, I would like to thank all my fellow Members. We have managed to find a common position with regard to the Council. However, I would also like to thank the Council and the Presidency of the Council very warmly at this point. Anyone who knows me will be aware that I am normally very sparing with praise and thanks. Nevertheless, I would like to express my sincere gratitude to the Swedish Presidency and, in particular, Mr Lindblad, for its work and its constant presence during the discussions on budget issues. This made a pleasant contrast to the other Council presidencies that I have experienced during the course of my long career as a Member of Parliament. Thank you very much. This morning, many Members took part in the discussion and I believe that on this occasion, there were many more Members involved than usual. The majority of them referred to the limitations of the budget and its structure. Ladies and gentlemen, we can confidently assume that the 2010 budget will be the last of its kind, the last with this structure, which leads us to believe that we can finance the necessary policies of the European Union and its new challenges and tasks in this way. We expect the new Commission to carry out the mid-term review quickly, as, under the terms of the agreements made in 2006, this should have been submitted by 2009 at the latest, in other words, by the end of this year. To spell it out, we also expect a revision proposal for the current financial perspective. We cannot wait until 2014 for reform. We need sustainable instruments now, so that the European Union can meet the challenges of the immediate future with democratic legitimacy, as the Chair of the Committee on Budgets, Mr Lamassoure, has just called for on behalf of all of us. Jutta Haug,  
draftsman of the opinion of the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Food Safety

 Ladies and gentlemen, it is no secret that the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Food Safety takes the view time and again – this year included – that the funds provided in the European budget absolutely do not suffice to provide effective environmental programmes, to maintain our biodiversity and for a fight against climate change that has a chance of succeeding. The fact that the Council makes even further cuts from these meagre funds is as incomprehensible as ever. That is why ‘back to the preliminary draft budget’ is the standard response. There are two things that we must impress on the Commission. The first of these is that we expect it to immediately include what are known as the ‘assigned revenues’ for those agencies that are partly dependent on fees – such as the European Medicines Agency in London or the European Chemicals Agency in Helsinki – in the preliminary draft budget and not to achieve an artificial margin by omitting them. The second point is that we expect the Commission to bring forward a proposal as soon as possible for how it will fund the anti-smoking campaign Help 
in future after the tobacco fund has run out. You see, it is the same every time. Jutta Steinruck  (S&amp;D

When we vote tomorrow on the own-initiative report on a Social Investment Pact, it will become apparent whether we finally have a cross-party understanding of how we need to tackle the crisis. Our collective response must be not simply cost-cutting measures, but specific measures to achieve the Europe 2020 targets. We can achieve these targets, but it will not happen by itself. If we want more jobs, we must make it possible for our economy to employ more people. Between 2008 and 2011, there was a 4 % fall in output in Europe (from 20 % to 16 %) which resulted in an 11 % fall in employment. On the one hand, that means that we have to invest in places where new jobs are needed. On the other hand, it also means that we have to pay special attention to the nature of these jobs: jobs must be sustainable and must offer decent employment conditions. The crisis must not be an excuse for low wages and social dumping! Europe’s economic policy must be expanded to include a compensatory social policy. We in particular, as the European Parliament, must resolutely uphold the interests of the individual in Europe. Accordingly, I would urge honourable Members to press energetically for European workers to be given back their right to decent employment! Jutta Steinruck  (S&amp;D

 The working conditions of women in the service sector are still not how we would like them to be. A quarter of all non-typical employees work in the service sector; in the German retail trade, there are almost a million so-called ‘mini-jobs’. Working women, who represent eight out of 10 of those employed in the service sector, are particularly strongly affected by this. We have already achieved a great deal in respect of equality between men and women, and we are on the right path to achieving even more. However, in the context of services, specifically, it is particularly important that agreement is finally reached on the Posting of Workers Directive. Women are particularly strongly affected by this: 58% of all the women working in posted positions in Germany work in the service sector. The percentage of female workers in, for example, care work is considerably higher than in many other sectors, and the working conditions are often very poor. What we need are minimum wage rates, limits on working hours and safety standards that are reasonable for all female workers in Europe. We can only achieve these objectives if we lay down clear rules for the posting of workers by temporary employment agencies. I am therefore pleased to see that the rapporteur takes up the subject of mobility in her opinion. We advocate a clearly regulated legal framework for Europe’s internal market in the field of services in order to prevent precarious labour relations and discrimination. Jutta Steinruck  (S&amp;D

 As rapporteur for the Programme for Social Change and Innovation, which integrates the three programmes EURES, Progress and the European Progress Microfinance Facility, I would like to draw attention to two specific matters. The Committee on Employment and Social Affairs rejected the Commission proposal to finance the cross-border partnerships through the European Social Fund (ESF) from 2014 onwards. If the financing of these partnerships were only to be possible within the framework of the ESF, each participating Member State would have to include this in its operational programme for the ESF. In view of the many priority areas for subsidies that is unlikely to happen. Cross-border partnerships for mobility-related advice must also be financed via the EURES axis. This call is supported across the groups and across the Member States, and I am hoping for the support of the Council. It is a question of facilitating mobility and of providing the associated advice. With a broad consensus and the support of all of the groups, we have introduced a fourth axis for a Youth Initiative. This is about financing specific projects for combating youth unemployment. The Youth Initiative will only be integrated into the programme if additional financing is secured via the multiannual financial framework. The Commission and the Council are always saying that something has to be done to combat youth unemployment, but there is a lack of projects. If combating youth unemployment really is a priority for the Council then this is the opportunity to prove it. Jutta Steinruck  (S&amp;D

 Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, in view of the economic problems, the crisis and the challenges faced by European companies, their employees, creditors and other shareholders and stakeholders, EU company law needs to focus on a sustainable, forward-looking corporate model characterised by long-term thinking. I am therefore asking you to pursue the aims of a social Europe. As part of that, you need to look at the involvement of workers in corporate decisions. You should also involve the social partners in your initiatives. After all, businesses have a social responsibility towards society and in respect of their contribution to growth and employment. In all your proposals, you must ensure that, as far as possible, existing rules on codetermination cannot be bypassed or eroded. We need the highest possible standards in European companies and we need corporate decisions to involve all those affected. Jutta Steinruck  (S&amp;D
),

 I expect the European Commission to finally learn the lessons of the crisis. There are some good ideas, but there is a lack of commitment. I welcome proposals such as support for start-ups, the overdue consultation paper on the quality framework for internships, or the youth initiative to give young people some career prospects. However, well-intentioned proposals do not reduce youth unemployment. Improving the quality of work and strong codetermination must remain key elements of European policy. I reject the idea of the uniform contract of employment, which is another attempt to erode protection from termination of employment. I also take a highly critical view of a new tripartite pay monitoring committee at European level. The EU Treaty excludes the possibility of intervening in wage setting. It must stay that way. Along with the trade unions, we in the Group of the Progressive Alliance of Socialists and Democrats in the European Parliament would warn against using the crisis to undermine the autonomy of the social partners.

 2007 was the ‘European Year of Equal Opportunities’. Five years later and Europe is still at square one. It is true that we have established the legal principle of the same remuneration for men and women. Nonetheless, wage inequality for men and women still exists. We are making little or no progress. I am pleased, therefore, that, as well as setting targets, the rapporteur has also provided some specific, detailed recommendations in her report. We need collective redress when this principle of equal pay is violated. It must be possible to obtain prosecutions for wage discrimination. We are calling for awareness campaigns dealing with wage inequality for men and women. We need wage equality officers in the various Member States. This will enable progress in the Member States to be monitored more effectively. We need to make specific progress. In this case specific progress means pursuing legal initiatives requiring equal pay for men and women. Jutta Steinruck  (S&amp;D

 Mr Clark, you and some of the previous speakers have mentioned a reduction in red tape as a cure-all to get rid of youth unemployment in Europe. I would be very interested to know, however, what exactly you mean by that, and whether you are also aware of the consequences of certain measures. Jutta Steinruck  (S&amp;D
). 
 – (DE)
 Madam President, Commissioner, many of the previous speakers have already mentioned that we are on the way to losing a generation of young people. I think that we all also agree that it is high time that something was done. Initial proposals were made in January this year or in December, so we have already wasted a couple of years with nothing but declarations of intent and a failure to tackle things in concrete terms; instead, responsibilities have been shifted to and fro at European level. I hope that is now in the past. Single-minded austerity is destroying the jobs of our young people. Growth creates jobs and training places, including for the young people of Europe, and also saves the costs of future social expenditure. What we need now is a rescue package for young people, for young Europeans, that is given just as much priority as was the rescue package for the banks. We found it easy to spend EUR 800 billion on rescuing the banks. It was right, and it was important, but we have to do it just as vehemently for something that will be much more important to us in the future, or at least equally as important. Alternatively, what about the EUR 82 billion that has not been spent from the Structural Funds? As the previous speaker has already said, we need to call off the money. That would give us EUR 15 000 to spend on each unemployed young person in Europe, if that would simplify things. Moreover, as the previous speaker mentioned, we also have to use the Structural Funds for this in the future. Together with my shadow rapporteurs, I have started initiatives for my report on the Programme for Social Change and Innovation, so that we very specifically allocate funding for a youth initiative. I hope, then, that I will also have the support of this Parliament, of the Commission and also of the Council in getting this funding, since everyone says that it is so important, and that this will also be anchored today in the other funds. This money could be very well used for the future of us all. Jutta Steinruck  (S&amp;D
). 
 – (DE)
 Mr President, I, too, would like to thank the rapporteur and, like the previous speaker, I welcome this regulation, on which we will be voting today. Europe’s internal market provides benefits for the workers, too, but sadly, in the past, loopholes in the law have been exploited in relation to cross-border mobility. One example of this – and this has been mentioned by a few of the previous speakers – concerns the airline business. Flight routes were often consciously chosen in such a way that airline staff were often socially insured in the Member State where social security was cheapest for the airline. This distorted competition, and it is an example of wage and social dumping, which takes place time and again at the expense of the workers. That is why we, as European Social Democrats, fought hard to ensure that airline staff are socially insured and have to pay their taxes where they are stationed. In a social Europe, there is no room for businesses that exploit the advantages of Europe’s single market while shirking the social responsibility that is the other side of the same coin. Jutta Steinruck  (S&amp;D

Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, without quotas I would not be a Member of this House, but I am also self-confident enough to say that I do not do my work badly, nor am I a bad politician. I believe that the quotas fulfil their purpose, since, in the past, we had 100% male quotas, and the time has come for us to do away with them. The reality is that there is progress when it comes to equal rights for women in Europe. It may be at a snail’s pace, but fortunately the movement is in the right direction. Especially in times of crisis such as those in which we find ourselves at the moment, it becomes particularly clear that there is still major discrimination against women in the European labour market. Women are the first to be fired, in traditional female professions our salaries are currently going backwards in many cases, and women in executive roles continue to be in short supply, despite better qualifications from secondary and tertiary education. Today we have discussed how women in Europe – and this is not news to us – continue to earn less than their male colleagues. It is not enough to talk about this and to debate it, however. Ultimately, we have to also start to change fundamental structures. Professions that are mainly occupied by women are, as a rule, less well paid. We need new and more objective ways of evaluating work, while greater transparency in respect of salaries would also be an important step towards equal pay. The culture of silence in business keeps women in the dark about the fact that they earn less. If we had more transparency within companies, women could defend themselves better against this, and this needs to be tackled now, just as we need quotas on boards of directors, in executive roles or even in political positions.

 The budget consolidation must be based on the objectives of the Europe 2020 strategy. Since the beginning of the crisis, it has been clear that, in focusing on economic consolidation, the Commission and the Member States have forgotten that only balanced and socially just reforms will bring about sustainable growth. Unilateral austerity measures and cuts in social security funding will not result in a stable economy and good, secure jobs in the long term. Sensible tax policies must be introduced to increase revenue. The focus of our efforts this year must be on creating more jobs and combating youth unemployment and poverty. It is completely incomprehensible to me that the Group of the European People’s Party (Christian Democrats) has prevented Member States with a current account surplus from being required to help put an end to the recession and create jobs. This would have been a step towards a single European economic policy. The conservatives should finally understand that national egoism will only intensify the crisis. Jutta Steinruck  (S&amp;D

 Mr President, my question is for Commissioner Andor. As you know, my group has for quite some time been calling for the Posting of Workers Directive to be revised, and I find it very regrettable that the Commission has thus far not done so. It is not as if there is a shortage of reasons to do so: we have social dumping on a massive scale and the principle of equal treatment applies to too few criteria. Furthermore, there is often abuse of posted workers by means of failure to adhere to the rules. What we need is limits on subcontractor chains and more opportunities for information for workers. I therefore await the Commission’s proposals on the posting of workers package with baited breath. My question is this: how does the Commission proposal for the Enforcement Directive seek to tackle the problems with the Posting of Workers Directive that I have outlined? Most importantly, are there measures in the proposal to prevent the well-known problem of social dumping? Jutta Steinruck  (S&amp;D
). 
 – (DE)
 I have a specific follow-up question. You said that the aim was to improve on the original directive. In my initial question, I asked about limits on subcontractor chains, better opportunities for information for workers and better control mechanisms. I also wanted to know what specific steps are being taken to prevent social dumping in future. Jutta Steinruck  (S&amp;D

 I hope that today’s own-initiative report will be interpreted by the Commission in the way it was written by Parliament, because a directive on the transfer of company seats could have considerable negative effects on the rules on corporate codetermination. That applies not just to Germany, but throughout the European Union. The transfer of a company’s registered office could result in the loss of codetermination at corporate level. Transferring the company’s registered office to another country could allow the rules on corporate codetermination in Germany to be circumvented. At present, employees’ codetermination in a company is based on the Member State in which the company has its registered office. We are not talking about a nominal registered office; rather, the company must be registered where it actually has a genuine presence, such as business premises, employees, etc. In other words, it must have a genuine link with the state in which it is registered. We cannot allow the directive on transfers of company seats to be used to circumvent the rights of employees and creditors through the establishment of post-box offices abroad. If separation between the registered office and the administrative seat of a company is allowed, then social rights could effectively be eroded – and that is something we have to prevent. This can only work if the registered office of a company is in the country where it is actually based. That is the way to safeguard effectively the rights of employees in the European Union. I hope the Commission will safeguard social Europe, and the rights of its citizens, in its draft legislation. Jutta Steinruck  (S&amp;D

 Firstly, I would like to say that I am very pleased. This Presidency brings me pleasure in two ways. First of all, the Danish Government is headed by a woman and, secondly, she is a member of the right party. Given that 2012 is the ‘European Year for Active Ageing and Solidarity between the Generations’, I welcome the initiative by the Danish Presidency to encourage older people to join the labour market. The call for increased gender equality will also have a positive impact on labour markets throughout Europe. This is something that is urgently needed, in particular in the light of the demographic change which is underway in Europe. The younger generation has also not been forgotten. The focus will be on young people who leave the education system too early. The European Parliament has shown what it can do in this respect. During the negotiations on the so-called six-pack, we ensured that collective bargaining autonomy was protected as part of all the measures involved. The European Parliament will take this approach in many areas in future. We finally need to solve the problem of fiscal policy. Also, the regulation of the financial markets must remain high on the agenda. The European Parliament will work together with the Danish Presidency under the leadership of the social democratic Prime Minister Helle Thorning-Schmidt to resolve these issues. Jutta Steinruck,

Madam President, I would like to thank the authors of the questions and the Commissioner for his statement. The German Social Democrats are also in favour of mobility and the free movement of workers on the European labour market. That is an important and key fundamental freedom. Although the facts dispel all fears, the German conservative-liberal Government is also no doubt planning to refuse to allow all workers to fully exercise this fundamental right. I find that very disappointing when I look at other European policy areas. In contrast to other countries, Germany has not made use of the transitional periods in order to make the German labour market fit for Europe. Time and again in Germany, I receive reports from colleagues from Romania and Bulgaria informing me of the methods being used in Germany. I can tell you that these are almost always bordering on illegal or are actually illegal. A further extension and a further denial of this fundamental right will only serve to promote fraud, undeclared employment and ostensible self-employment. It is not the influx of workers from Bulgaria and Romania that creates problems but the lack of fair conditions on the labour market. For us in Germany, these include the lack of a minimum wage and too little control of undeclared employment and combating of ostensible self-employment. Therefore, we must also put the principle of equal pay and equal working conditions for equal work in the same place into practice and introduce it in a uniform way at European level. Then, all workers within Europe will also be able to move around to work with dignity. (Applause) Jutta Steinruck  (S&amp;D

 I would like to thank Ms Delli for this report. The importance of health cannot be emphasised often enough. According to the European Agency for Safety and Health at Work in Bilbao, almost 28% of European workers claim to have significant health problems. This means that one in four workers in Europe is affected. Therefore, we must not only apply the existing occupational health legislation better in the Member States; we must also develop and improve it further, because the workplace is constantly changing, too. Whereas physical ailments were previously the top work-related illnesses, today it is mostly mental disorders that are on the rise in the workplace. This development, in particular, must be investigated thoroughly by means of improved health monitoring. The measures need to be adapted for this purpose. Prevention must also play a greater role. Furthermore, we must not forget that there are also certain groups whose health needs special protection. It has been proven that young, older and migrant workers and workers with precarious jobs are more frequently exposed to occupational hazards. If people are working without previous training or the necessary skills, the risk of disease or accident increases sharply. We must prevent this from happening. Jutta Steinruck  (S&amp;D

Madam President, this report is a good one and represents an important step in the right direction. Combating poverty and social exclusion is the responsibility of the Member States, but in the past, the national governments have not been sufficiently ambitious and have taken too few concrete measures. Well-meaning words are not enough. The current austerity policies in Europe, which have resulted in cuts in social budgets, are also creating more poverty in new areas. In the employment policy guidelines and the Europe 2020 strategy, we have set ourselves the goal of reducing the number of people at risk of poverty by 20 million. In my opinion, a key factor in this respect is employment, in the form of good jobs. A total of 8% of European employees are classified as working poor and 22% of the people at risk of poverty in Europe have a job. That is a quarter of the population. For this reason, we must begin by introducing fairer labour and social standards and minimum wages. Jutta Steinruck  (S&amp;D

The Professional Qualifications Directive is a key element in the integration of the labour market and an important step in achieving equal opportunities in European society. Many Member States have not yet implemented the directive and there are still far too many problems with recognition. This is also evident in the document from the Commission on which this own-initiative report is based. I welcome this report whole heartedly because it paves the way for the position the European Parliament is to adopt in relation to the promised revised directive at the beginning of next year. From an employment policy perspective, I would once again emphasise that we need to put an end quickly to the sometimes unfair practices found in the Member States. We cannot have a situation where, in many cases, qualifications are not recognised in order to keep wage costs low. This is clearly a problem of misalignment and is causing difficulties for immigrant job-seekers. This not only constitutes an infringement of the principle of equality, but also significantly restricts mobility within the workforce. The European Parliament needs to take a clear line on this in the forthcoming revision of the directive. I look forward to continued excellent cooperation. Jutta Steinruck  (S&amp;D

 Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, Nokia was exempted from paying tax in Romania for 30 years and only three years later is moving to Asia. Nokia received massive financial support for the construction of its plant in Bochum in Germany and then for its plant in Cluj in Romania. At the same time, the redundancies and the safeguards put in place for the employees were financed from public funds. I believe that it is dishonest to cite the crisis and production costs that are allegedly too high or, as has been mentioned today, environmental legislation as a justification for mass redundancies. Every employee at the plant in Cluj generates turnover of EUR 1 million each year and costs less than EUR 10 000 per year. We can no longer stand by and watch companies unscrupulously pocketing European money and then simply moving on like a plague of locusts. All the small agencies working on European projects have to sign contracts concerning the sustainability of their projects. Why does the same rule not apply to large companies? It is high time for us to introduce clear, tough regulations in this area. A voluntary approach and calls for compliance are completely useless. As long as companies like this exist, the European Globalisation Adjustment Fund, which is vitally important for workers in Europe, must not be called into question. We must help the people who are suffering. Jutta Steinruck  (S&amp;D

Madam President, ‘new skills and new jobs’ takes the form of guidelines for the Europe 2020 strategy and represents an important step towards increasing employment and growth. However, this must not mean that the labour markets are made more flexible unilaterally, without the involvement of unions and management, and, at the same time, that workers have little or no social protection. Flexicurity, a combination of security and flexibility, has so far only been used by the Member States as a magic word which will allow them to gradually increase flexibility and also to make working conditions more precarious. We do not want flexicurity under these circumstances. A cheap approach will not create jobs. We have established this during the discussion on the previous item. Therefore, I would like to emphasise once again that we are strongly opposed to the single open-ended contracts proposed by the Commission. From our perspective, offering contracts which will result in a lowering of social standards to young people who are starting work will not create one single job. Instead, it will play the different generations on the labour market off against one another. Labour market reforms must be negotiated with unions and management and must provide robust pension systems, training, employee rights and social security. We are very much opposed to interventions in the national systems for wage negotiations involving management and unions. I would like to thank everyone involved. I hope that tomorrow, we will adopt this positive report which would be further improved by the two amendments from the Group of the Progressive Alliance of Socialists and Democrats in the European Parliament.

 Public procurement not only needs to be made more flexible; it also needs to be made more sustainable. We must use the revision of the procurement directives as an opportunity for a change of strategy in favour of qualitative growth. We need to use public procurement to get rid of existing inequalities and to provide ecological incentives: it is a matter of good work on public contracts, adhering to collective agreements and maintaining and checking social and ecological standards. These requirements are more important than ever when faced with strict budgetary constraints. I am pleased that the report incorporates some of these demands, particularly the anchoring of social and ecological standards and the removal of the criterion of the cheapest offer. We need to maintain this line in the announced revision of the directives at the end of the year. We need to go even further, however: it is a matter of the protection of posted workers, compliance with working standards and collective pay agreements and good work. I hope that the Commission has noted the signal we have sent and will take it into consideration when making its proposals. Public procurement is not a market-based instrument for achieving the aims of the EU 2020 strategy, but rather needs to be used to develop the social and ecological aspects of the European project further.

Madam President, my question is directed at Mr Andor. A few weeks ago, Mr Andor, I visited a large building site in France along with other Members from my group to find out at first hand about how mobile European workers are being treated. Those employees in particular who were supplied by temporary employment agencies and who came from Poland, for example, were being subjected to appalling exploitation. Their working conditions were very poor. During this year alone, up to the time of our visit, three people had died in occupational accidents on the building site. The workers lived in dreadful conditions. Tax and social security contributions were deducted from their wages, but they had no right to health insurance. It was not clear where the taxes were actually going. This is just one of many examples of how the legal and also the illegal opportunities are being exploited. My questions are: What measures is the Commission planning to take to guarantee that the Posting of Workers Directive is implemented properly in the Member States? What proposals is the Commission making to prevent employees recruited through long chains of subcontractors from being exploited? Jutta Steinruck  (S&amp;D

Older women are discriminated against on two counts on the labour market: because of their gender on the one hand, and because of their age on the other. The consequence for women aged 65 and over is the prospect of a poverty-stricken old age. The increase in atypical, precarious employment, mostly involving women, is a growing problem in Europe. We must ensure that women aged between 55 and 64 remain in the labour market and are not sidelined. We must also to create the conditions that allow them to return to work. In the context of 2012 as the Year for Active Ageing, it is particularly important that the European Commission should redouble its efforts to improve the situation of older women and increase their participation in the labour market. Strengthening equality policy and increasing training opportunities are just two ways in which we can improve the situation of older women in the labour market in the long term. A good work-life balance is the key here. Different phases in life are associated with different demands on women in terms of family and professional commitments and should not be punished with pension reductions. Jutta Steinruck  (S&amp;D

 In its communication on social services of general interest the Commission already admitted last year that not all the Member States have the financial means to meet the growing demand for social services. In some countries there are, in fact, gaping holes in the social safety nets. It is important that we now fill these gaps. Mr De Rossa’s report is an important step in this direction, with the aim that social services may continue to facilitate social equality and social integration in the immediate future. The European Commission’s one-sided political concentration on the rules of the internal market is a big mistake. Budgetary consolidation at all costs is not the solution. The public sector has become the main target of all the austerity measures which are aimed at bringing budget deficits back into line following the rescue packages given to banks threatened with bankruptcy. The loss of public services will only increase the suffering of those who have been particularly hard hit by the current crisis in many Member States. I welcome the European Voluntary Quality Framework, which aims to ensure high quality even in difficult times. This is, moreover, a voluntary quality framework that includes the stakeholders in the process, and its principles support the quality systems of the Member States. I hope that the Commission will continue along the lines set out in Mr De Rossa’s report and its own communication from last year; in other words, that it will ‘fill the gaps’ rather than tearing open new holes.

 The subject of the management of spent fuel and radioactive waste is highly topical. Recent events in Japan have once again highlighted the immediate risks which affect workers and citizens who are exposed to radioactive material. We have many tonnes of radioactive waste in Europe which people have to move about. I am pleased that we can lay the foundations which will help to protect these people’s health throughout the whole of Europe. We have produced a report in Parliament which is based on the Commission’s technical report and which puts the focus on people, including employees of transport companies and plants which work with radioactive waste and employees at the final storage sites. Therefore, the members of the Committee on Employment and Social Affairs have focused on protecting the workers involved by putting in place safety measures, health protection measures and training for employees on the subject of radioactive waste. Economic interests must never be given a higher priority than the health of workers and citizens. Therefore, we need comprehensive documentation of all the waste and its management, while it remains harmful to people and the environment. I am pleased that so many of our requirements have been included in the final report by the Committee on Industry, Research and Energy. Jutta Steinruck  (S&amp;D

 I welcome the report on European cooperation in vocational education and training and would like to emphasise how important it is to promote lifelong learning through initiatives and Europe-wide programmes in order to make it possible for workers to have a better future. These days, workers are at the mercy of frequent and risky employment transitions. There are many types of transition: from training, redundancy, internships or precarious employment into full-time employment. The report contains some important points, including increasing the quota of women in work, recognition of informal learning and promotion of languages with the goal of providing mobility programmes. I am particularly pleased that the focus has been placed on education and training for young people, which is something that I will actively support in the flagship initiatives that follow. The transition from educational institution to working life must be as smooth as possible and, in particular, tailored to individual needs, because it must also be possible for young people with inadequate training to gain the skills necessary to be able to work in skilled jobs and to earn a good living. Social background must not determine a person’s educational opportunities. Young people must be given help and support in securing entry to the world of work. However, the cost of a modern labour market policy must not be borne by our workers. Jutta Steinruck,

 Mr President, let us get back on topic. As rapporteur for the opinion of the Committee on Employment and Social Affairs, I would like to thank everyone who worked on this report. In the committee, all the groups pursued the unanimous objective of making education and training possible for every young person in Europe and supporting their entry into a career, while no young person should fall by the wayside. I did not base my opinion for the committee on the Commission report, as I found it too unspecific. It was important to me for very specific tasks, too, to be listed in the report. In some cases, I was unable to support the positions taken in the report. In the view of the Committee on Employment and Social Affairs, one important aspect is the transition from school to career. It is a core interface. This transition must take place without time spent waiting around. We also found it important that young people’s entry into their careers should not be associated with social dumping and that it must not take place under conditions of dumping. We felt that the role of traineeships was important. They are important and they are necessary, but their abuse must be avoided and forbidden. We would like to see an initiative for a European qualifications framework laying down minimum standards for traineeships. I will close with a request of Parliament and the Commission to ensure that the Youth in Action programme does not suffer financial cuts or even abolition in favour of the Youth on the Move programme. The work of youth associations is important for social engagement and helps young people progress, both in terms of substance and personally. That is also a major advantage for later working life.

 This report shone the spotlight on an occupational category that is all too often neglected. What would European culture be without creative artists? While developing the creative industries economically, we must not forget those who work in this sector. As the shadow rapporteur for my group in the Committee on Employment and Social Affairs, the social situation and the conditions in which creative artists in Europe live are particularly important. Unfortunately, many of the 5 million people who make their livelihoods from the creative sector live in precarious conditions. Second and third jobs are not rare, as one job is often not enough to live on. A lack of health and pension insurance is on the agenda. Contracts are mostly uncertain, and many creative workers are scarcely able to plan more than a couple of months in advance. Moreover, a fair level of social security protection, with adequate insurance against unemployment, sickness and for old age, must be standard practice also for those working in the creative sector. I am very pleased to see that the rapporteur followed the position of the Committee on Employment and Social Affairs in this regard and included it in the report. It is now time for the Commission and the Member States to remedy these social deficiencies and to promise the many creative minds of Europe that creative artists in Europe need not live as an underclass.

 Mr President, it is very significant that the Member who asked the question has left the room during the discussion. The arguments and questions put by some of the previous speakers once again demonstrate a highly revealing populist mindset. We are in the midst of a crisis and, as usual, savings are being made in areas which affect the workers. I think that this is a very one-sided approach. I would like to look briefly at the European Training Foundation (ETF). It is important because of its cooperation with the International Labour Organisation (ILO) in the EU’s partner countries. It enables the European social model to be exported to acceding countries and provides help with developing education, vocational training and further education programmes and with creating secure jobs. Two weeks ago, I was in Belgrade and, in meetings with education and training providers, I was once again assured of the importance of the agency. The same thing happened in meetings in Turkey. The ETF plays a very important role in helping the acceding countries to enter the EU labour market. If we take a more far-sighted approach, the Arab spring is also very important. We do not want large numbers of refugees to come to Europe, so we must offer people support in their home countries. We must provide education and help the countries to develop training programmes and facilities. Jutta Steinruck  (S&amp;D

 Mr President, Commissioner, I sometimes have the feeling that you should try out all these solutions on the Commission itself so that you could see what impact you are actually having on Europe. Following your speech, I am left with the impression that the Commission really does sit in an ivory tower. The people of Europe – the workers, the low earners and the pensioners – are really picking up the bill, and you are interpreting legislation and competences however you please. On 19 October last year, I received a response to a question that I had put to the Commission in which it was explicitly confirmed that minimum wages and wages in general are the responsibility of the Member States. The response states this very emphatically. Please read it. It is not acceptable for you to give me that kind of answer when it is a good thing for employers and then simply change direction when you believe something is good for the other side. That will make the people of Europe really very unhappy. My fellow Member has just mentioned this. You are chipping away at codetermination. You are weakening the trade unions. That is not the way out of the crisis and you are fully aware of that. Those who caused the crisis must also be the ones to pay for it. (Applause) Jutta Steinruck  (S&amp;D

As we discuss the report by Mrs Nedelcheva today, the 100th anniversary of International Women’s Day, it is high time for us finally to follow up our words with deeds. The disadvantage suffered by women in Europe can only be combated effectively if we introduce binding rules instead of voluntary commitments. These include mandatory women’s quotas on corporate boards, as well as all other levels, the consistent combating of precarious employment conditions, which affect women far more than men, the improvement of career prospects for women during education by systematically expanding the range of careers open to them, a ban on financial disadvantage to women in taxation and income, statutory equality plans in business and industry in order to promote women, and regular checks and reports on the progress achieved in Europe, if any. Let me conclude by saying this: After 100 years of International Women’s Day, we women will no longer be satisfied with simple lip-service. We want binding statutory regulations and we want final recognition that the work of women makes a decisive contribution to our prosperity. Jutta Steinruck  (S&amp;D

 Madam President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, the Europe 2020 Strategy is very important, not only for the development of European social and economic policy, but also for national social and economic policy. We must take care to ensure that this strategy is not misused at European level to pursue a social clearance policy in the Member States. I am extremely shocked that, in its Annual Growth Survey, the Commission is proposing pay cuts and a reduction in social protection. Some previous speakers have already talked about this. The impact on the people locally will be disastrous. It is unacceptable for the people, the workers, to bear the costs of budgetary consolidation alone. I, too, would like to appeal to the Member States to be guided only by the integrated guidelines when they draw up their national reform programmes, as these enable a much better balance between social protection and economic growth. The Annual Growth Survey once again mentions open-ended contracts, which were previously mentioned in the Agenda for New Skills for New Jobs. Mr Andor, we debated this once before in November 2010: young people cannot be integrated into the labour market by watering down employee rights. Experience in Europe has shown that this watering down simply results in a shift to precarious working conditions and does not create new jobs. We need specific measures in order to help those people who are most at risk and not flagship initiatives that operate alongside each other rather than being integrated with one another. Jutta Steinruck  (S&amp;D

 Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, pensions throughout Europe must provide enough money for people to live on. One important requirement is that people have decent jobs, because low paid jobs result in poverty in old age and inadequate pension provision. When I hear other Members of this House saying that people simply need to take out an additional private pension for their old age, I want to reply that many people can barely survive on what they earn, never mind paying for an additional private pension. This is why the first pillar of the pension system is of particular importance. The pay-as-you-go system based on the solidarity principle must form the foundation of European pensions and it must provide enough for people to live on. We cannot simply say that this is a matter for the Member States. We must send out a clear signal that we need pensions which give people enough money to have a reasonable quality of life. Mr Mann gave a detailed description of the German occupational pension system. I would like to mention it too, without going into the same level of detail. In my assessment of the Green Paper, I have come to the same conclusion, which is why we worked on the amendments together in committee. Therefore, I am calling on the Commission to ensure that, in everything which we do in future, the distinctive features of each country – the things that really work well and are essential for the survival of the pension systems in the Member States – are not disregarded. Jutta Steinruck  (S&amp;D

 Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, the free movement of workers, the freedom of establishment and the freedom to provide services are vital pillars of our internal market. Of course, these must not act as a gateway for social dumping. Service providers must respect the law of the State in which they operate. The country of destination principle must thus also be enforced consistently. For that to happen, all the Member States must also do their homework. My home country of Germany has not done its homework in this regard, as there is quite clearly a lack of framework conditions for fair mobility and social security. There are no binding wage floors in many areas, the monitoring of undeclared work is inadequate and we have fictive self-employment as a common way of circumventing labour law. As Mr Geier already said, we also need advice centres in different languages for posted workers, not just for companies. If the freedom to provide services is also to benefit workers, there is still some homework to be done. Jutta Steinruck  (S&amp;D

 Mr President, Mr Andor, Mrs Vassiliou, it is true that combating unemployment and the goal of full employment together represent one of our most urgent tasks. As Mrs Harkin said, the people of Europe do not want concepts; they want concrete solutions. I would like to thank you for your initiative. There are a lot of positive approaches here which two colleagues from my group have referred to. However, I believe that some improvements are needed, because more flexibility and more mobility will not create a single new job. I would like to endorse what Mrs Schroedter said in this respect. We need good, secure jobs in Europe and the Member States and businesses must ensure that these are permanent jobs which allow people to earn a good living. This must become a general rule once again and we must work towards this on a European level and choose the right course. In the agenda, you refer to new forms of employment contract with fewer rights for employees who are just starting their careers. You refer to these as open-ended contractual arrangements. In my view, this will not create any new jobs. Experience shows, and the Social Democratic government in Germany found this out a few years ago, that weakening employees’ rights will not result in any jobs being created. Measures of this kind simply turn secure jobs into precarious jobs. We must not allow this to happen in future. Jutta Steinruck  (S&amp;D

 Since the financial crisis of 2008, the G20 Heads of State or Government have been meeting regularly every six months to discuss economic and financial issues and to bolster cooperation in order to achieve stable and sustainable growth for the world economy for the benefit of all. However, I believe that, in order to find a sustainable and appropriate response to the financial, economic or social problems of the crisis, we need a broader-based approach and a more balanced perspective on these problems. The Finance Ministers of the Member States are not in a position to evaluate the situation on the labour market and to come up with answers to the pressing labour and social policy issues that give due consideration to the needs of workers or the people in general. I therefore call for regular meetings of the Ministers for Employment and Social Affairs in the G20. Moreover, I call on the EU and those Member States that are also members of the G20 to develop this idea further and to cooperate more closely with one another in the field of employment and social policy and to aim for a more balanced approach at summit level. We cannot allow competition to undermine the protection of workers’ rights. We need to enforce these rights, not only for the citizens of the European Union, but also for the citizens of other countries around the world. Jutta Steinruck  (S&amp;D

 Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, what I feel is missing from this debate is the necessary distinction between national transposition in the Member States and the task that exists at European level. We all realise that we need to take the special features of individual nations into account. However, where the debate in Germany is concerned, for example, I must say that I can definitely see how Germany could implement this report. What we are concerned with here is creating minimum standards at EU level to establish social framework conditions for women. We are always keen to make reference to the ILO when it comes to good work, protection at work and protecting health, so I ask myself: why not in this case? As far as the debate on costs is concerned, I would like to remind everyone in this House that in Germany – as well as in some other European countries – the anti-discrimination directive brought about a huge amount of lobbying on the part of enterprises. There was talk of an avalanche of costs, of companies going bankrupt, of burdens on the economy and on workers themselves. Looking back years later, how much of this happened? None of it. I find this debate, this lobbying, very reminiscent of that time. I urge you at last to put the economy on one side and to put people at the heart of what we do. I am not one of those merely sermonising here. I have stated that I advocate a social Europe. For me, that includes women. In this situation, women need our help. Jutta Steinruck  (S&amp;D

 The experience of countries where liberalisation has already taken place shows that liberalisation of postal services is a downward spiral. Competition must not be played out at the expense of workers, in other words on the basis of pay and working conditions. We must retain high quality jobs in the European postal service, because that is the only way that we will be able to guarantee the universal service for everyone. Postal services must be equally accessible to everyone, wherever they live – it must be a basic right. It is the Commission’s job to protect the citizens of the European Union from social dumping and to maintain labour standards. So far, however, nothing has been done. The opening up of European markets must not go hand in hand with the abolition of social protection rights. We reject the competition between the social systems of the Member States. I call for a moratorium until the social impact has been investigated, social conditions are secure throughout the postal market, the financing of the universal services is ensured and a way is found for competition to be based on quality and innovation in the market. Member States must provide legislative guarantees of the full accessibility of postal services. Jutta Steinruck  (S&amp;D

 Mr President, I would like to ask the Council to take note of our vote today and I would like to request a brief statement. Jutta Steinruck,  
on behalf of the S&amp;D Group.
 – (DE) 
Madam President, I would like to begin my speech with a criticism of the procedure. Parliament’s work has been greatly impaired by the late tabling of this report. It was only really able to present its position because exceptions were made and the Council is not now going to debate this matter until the autumn summit. In the end, a workable compromise was found. The cooperation between the rapporteur and the shadow rapporteurs was excellent. That can also be seen by the fact that we received a clear majority for our position in committee. As Social Democrats, we were able to include very many of our key concerns, although we are not happy with every point. However, I am grateful for the assurance from the Belgian Presidency that it will support Parliament’s position. In order to facilitate this procedure, we have tabled four amendments, for which we request support in tomorrow’s vote. It was important to us that the guidelines for employment policies contain social components, in other words, a definition of good work, the stipulation that good work must also be well paid, and that testable interim goals are also laid down. However, the guidelines will only be taken seriously in the Member States if the Commission and the Council take them seriously. We therefore ask the Commission to ensure that appropriate measures are implemented and that the results are also examined. I am pleased that the Commissioner has assured us that our positions will be included, because Parliament has added a very socially-orientated and worker-friendly component which will benefit the people of Europe. That is also what people expect of this Parliament and this represents an improvement in social conditions. Jutta Steinruck  (S&amp;D

 Mr President, Mr Barroso, Mr Van Rompuy, it is important that we all work together to promote growth and employment and attempt to eliminate the causes of the crisis. However, our goal must be to learn from our previous mistakes and not to make those mistakes again. One subject which we must not lose sight of and which is particularly important to me is the fight against poverty. It is a pity that the European Heads of Government were not prepared to commit to implementing the Commission proposals on combating poverty as quickly as possible. The message sent out by the Council last week is that Europe does not care about the poorest people. The original goals have been watered down. All that remains are three key figures and the objective of lifting 20 million people out of poverty. That is not enough and it is clear that there is a real lack of political will in this respect. We had really hoped that the Commission proposal to reduce poverty by 25% would be adopted and taken forward, because poverty ultimately represents a risk for Europe. Jutta Steinruck  (S&amp;D
). 
 – (DE) 
Madam President, of course we need economic governance and, of course, the Member States must consolidate and restructure their budgets. However, what we are now seeing is a radical reduction in the social budget. Unemployment and poverty are increasing and people do not understand why banks and companies are receiving support while the politicians simply pay lip service to combating poverty and unemployment and put in place objectives that cannot be monitored. This is why the Europe 2020 strategy and the integrated guidelines are so important. We want to continue striving for the goal of full employment and we want proper work, not vulnerable jobs. When it comes to combating poverty, our goals really must be more ambitious. This is why we are calling on the Council to take up the Commission’s proposal to reduce poverty in Europe by 25%. The European Parliament has specific objectives and it is important for Parliament to be taken seriously. Jutta Steinruck  (S&amp;D
). 
 – (DE) 
Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, I would like to appeal once more to the conservatives and liberals that we cannot here place the interests of the self-employed above the safety of the people of Europe. Entrepreneurial freedom is undoubtedly a very good thing, but the safety of our children and of everyone on the roads is more important – and that, to my mind, is the responsible way for Europe to act. Tomorrow’s vote is an opportunity to show that you are not in favour of social dumping. What this debate has also shown in recent months is that a debate on ostensible self-employment in Europe is long overdue. More and more regular employment relationships are being ousted by ostensible self-employment, which is why we urgently need the situation to be analysed and a proposal to be made for what we can do about it. As the Commissioner stated quite clearly today, we have had many declarations of intent on this matter. It is time to act at last. Jutta Steinruck  (S&amp;D
).  
– (DE)
 Mr President, Mr Mann, I hope you are in regular contact with your Chancellor, if you see things in the same way that I do. The EU 2020 strategy is a real opportunity to make Europe more social and we need that opportunity at this very moment when many hostile words are directed at Europe and when it has distanced itself from the people. We absolutely need to offer something positive to our citizens that will offset that situation. When it comes to growth and employment, we should stop putting people’s interests behind those of business. Indeed, that must be the key objective of the EU 2020 strategy because Europe needs social progress. I already pointed that out last Monday at the committee debate on employment policy guidelines: we must not lose sight of the goal of full employment, but we cannot have full employment at all costs because we need good jobs. We always say we need jobs, but what matters to me is that these jobs are good, that there is social security, that people do not have to receive subsidies and that they can actually make a living from these jobs. The ever more precarious nature of working life, the increasing income inequality and also growing poverty – which many speakers have talked about today – must finally be brought to an end with the EU 2020 strategy. We need a more active labour market policy and one which covers many areas. Finally, people expect more specific answers, very specific answers, in fact, and not an umpteenth strategy!

 Yesterday, the media told us that the Opel plant in Antwerp will close. This is just one of many examples of jobs being lost in Europe. Next Thursday, the European industrial trade unions will be holding a day of demonstrations throughout Europe. They are calling for jobs and the future of Europe as an industrial base to be safeguarded. The trade union members want full employment, but they also want effective European policies and definitive answers today, not in five years’ time. Your work programme does not provide very definitive information in this respect. You have just referred to the guidelines and the Europe 2020 position paper. In my view, this is not specific enough. You should provide examples. What do you plan to do to re-establish our strategically important industrial sectors in Europe and what role is the Commission playing in making the automotive industry future-proof and in safeguarding jobs? Jutta Steinruck  (S&amp;D

 Commissioner Špidla, Madam President, the Commission should protect European interests and on that point I agree with what previous speakers have said. The Commission should reconsider its approach. From tomorrow, General Motors will be trying to rake in EUR 2.7 billion worth of public aid across Europe, without contributing a single cent of their own. We have to make it clear that Europe, i.e. the Commission, will not make any money available if that means that further plants will be shut down or that production will relocate outside Europe. However, at the same time, Member States should not support General Motor’s plans to that effect and should not think only about saving their own plants. We should not allow workers to be played off against one another, nor should Member States allow themselves to be so, because any such divisions would result in further off-shoring. The European taxpayer and Opel’s other workers in Europe should not foot that bill. Nobody will understand that over there! People want to understand what the European Union is doing. Whatever plans General Motors might have for Europe, the Commission should ensure that they play to European rules. The European Works Council has proposed a solidarity-based solution and a sound financial rescue plan for Opel, whereby all the plants would remain in Europe and whereby adjustments would be made in all plants on the basis of solidarity. Management should not be allowed to ignore this plan, nor should Mr Reilly and his colleagues disregard the consultation process with the European Works Council or the rights of consultation and participation which we have secured for European workers. A solidarity-based European solution for Opel is possible, but the Commission must get involved. Jutta Steinruck  (S&amp;D

 Madam President, I have a comment to make on what our fellow Member has said about there not being enough German MEPs attending this debate. Although I am a German Social Democrat, I share your criticism of the Minister of North Rhine-Westphalia, who is a member of the CDU, having said that he was pleased that it was the plant in Antwerp, rather than the one in Bochum, that was being closed down. We, the German Social Democrats, are in favour of a European solution, in other words, the plan put forward by the European Works Council. Let me say this very clearly once again: I have no idea why the German Conservatives and Liberals have shirked this debate. Jutta Steinruck  (S&amp;D
). 
 – (DE)
 Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, this is actually about finding a common European solution, rather than about national egotism. Opel Europe has a significant role to play in industrial policy in Europe and this is not only about jobs at Opel, but also about jobs in many automotive supply companies in a number of European countries. The decision in favour of Magna – and the European Works Council has confirmed this for me – achieved a consensus in the European Works Council, too, and its members are working flat out on European solutions. The workers are ready to make sacrifices for this cause, and we expect the same from all the decision makers. Everyone needs to work together, and to do so quickly. Previous speakers have already talked about this. In the interests of the workers, it also makes sense, of course, for thousands of jobs truly to be temporarily stabilised with State aid. We will not grant validity to any competition arguments that have been put forward. We are dealing with people and with jobs, but also with whole regions. The path that we were put on under Germany’s auspices must now lead to the best possible result for all European workers, across all European sites. Kerstin Westphal,

Madam President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen. I can only say that patience is its own reward. The report on type approval for Category L vehicles has turned out well in the end. The work took longer, overall, than we all thought it would – certainly longer than we hoped it would – and there were a lot more pitfalls along the way than we would have liked. However, I would like, at this point, to thank the rapporteur, Mr van de Camp, most warmly for his excellent cooperation. Together we achieved a lot in our talks with the Member States. As rapporteur for my group, I commend this report to the House – even though it could have been better. By better I mean safer. For us Social Democrats, the emphasis right from the start was on the safety of vehicles and thus the safety of their drivers, above all those driving scooters and motorcycles. The figures for motorcycle accidents have remained constant for years. Basically the number of fatal accidents is declining in Europe – apart from those involving motorcycles. Cutting the number of motorcycle and scooter fatalities is something I feel passionate about. Fewer deaths on Europe’s roads was and is my goal. Each death is one death too many. In a regulation that brings so much benefit to the internal market, this issue must be addressed with vigour. I remain convinced that this can be achieved through effective anti-lock braking systems (ABS). I am equally convinced that they are cost-effective. It just is not true that ABS is too expensive. Anyway, we have secured a mandatory requirement that manufacturers must, as of 2016, fit all new motorcycles of 125 cc and over, and from 2017 all existing motorcycles of that capacity, with ABS.  Motor scooters may be fitted, at the choice of the vehicle manufacturer, with ABS or a combined brake system. In this respect, it must be said, unfortunately, that we have not managed to improve on the Commission’s proposal. I would have liked to have achieved a lot more here, but the Commission and Member States were – I choose my words carefully – very slow to move forward on the whole business. However, we secured the promise of a Commission report in 2019. The report is to include road accident figures from the Member States and will consider the mandatory fitting of ABS to motor scooters. It will be forwarded to Parliament and the Council. On the basis of the report, the Commission will then decide whether or not to make the fitting of ABS to motor scooters mandatory. As you can see, this remains very much a work in progress. Thus we shall seek to close the loophole in the law in 2019. I am sure the figures we receive will vindicate me. I am convinced that this is indeed a good day for two-wheeler riders in Europe, and that we shall see a drop in the accident figures in future. Kerstin Westphal,  
rapporteur.

 Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, demographic change is one of the most important themes in our times. For example, we know that every second girl born in Germany today will live to see their 100th birthday. My 13-year-old daughter was happy when she heard this news. However politicians must naturally also respond to this fact, drawing conclusions and establishing general political conditions. My report, which will be the subject of a vote tomorrow, deals with some of these conclusions and the associated general conditions. It does not deal with social issues such as pensions. This is quite simply beyond the remit of the Committee on Regional Development. What it does consider, however, is the question of what European cohesion policy can do and how we can organise future cohesion policy in order to respond to the pressing issues. I would like to draw attention to four areas mentioned in the report. Firstly: we need to tailor European cohesion policy more closely than ever to demographic change. Demographic change continues to play quite an important role in the Europe 2020 strategy and in the legislative proposals. Now, as we come to implement the strategy, we must ensure that the topic remains on the agenda. The second area relates to infrastructure: we need infrastructure suitable to the needs of older people in order to avoid social exclusion. This includes accessibility to public buildings, for example. This move would also benefit other groups, such as families with small children or people with disabilities. At the same time, we need to make areas affected by emigration more attractive, particularly to young families. The third area relates to older people, children and families. More and more older people live in the various regions of Europe. Regional policy must respond to this fact. For me, this also means promoting so-called multi-generational housing, as well as European Regional Development Fund (ERDF) and European Social Fund (ESF) support in the social and health care sectors. Also, when it comes to the prevention of emigration, I believe that well-qualified full-time day care for children plays a very important role. It is a pity that the majority in the committee were not in favour of providing free child care. I would have liked to see much more courage here. The fourth area of concern is employment. Our prime concern here must be to combat unemployment among women and young people. We have a cohort of young women who are the best-educated generation in Europe of all time. If these women are denied employment opportunities, then we could be accused of being responsible ourselves for creating the shortage of specialist professionals. It is also important that we should make much more use of the knowledge and experience of older people. Appropriate structures must also be established for this purpose in the regions. I believe we all agree that we need to take an active approach by shaping demographic change rather than just managing it. European regional policy can make a huge contribution here. I would like to thank all the members of the committee who have worked on this report. This has been a long journey and several people have grown old and even retired while the work went on. The result has been worth the effort, however. I think we have produced a good report and I hope that the majority will vote in favour at tomorrow’s plenary. Kerstin Westphal  (S&amp;D
).

 Mr President, Mr Hahn, Mr Andor, ladies and gentlemen, I do not need to emphasise how important cohesion and regional policy is for the process of living together and growing together in Europe. However, I also believe that in future, regional policy and cohesion policy must focus more closely on our cities. Cities are an important driving force behind development in Europe. At the same time, they are currently suffering from environmental, economic and social problems. This is why I have a particular question for Mr Hahn. What opportunities do you think there are for highlighting the urban dimension? To come to the point, Mr Hahn, you recently indicated during an event which took place in this House that you had a specific percentage of the regional funding in mind which would be reserved for highlighting the urban dimension. Is this still the case? If so, what percentage were you thinking of? Kerstin Westphal  (S&amp;D
),  
in writing. 
– On behalf of the S&amp;D Group, I want to express our general consent to this report. It is important that the European Parliament fights for greater transparency in regional policy, but we reject the so-called ‘naming and shaming’, as asked for in point 16 of this report. We certainly agree to a tougher line on communication and information requirements, but the goal of more transparency – which we also support – should not be achieved by the wrong means. We are afraid of having a ‘witch-hunt’ when naming and shaming is carried out. The European Commission should not be made a moral authority which achieves group discipline by naming, shaming or blaming. We also reject this approach as it could lead to a more complex situation and non-implementation in the Member States. Despite this concern, we agree – as stated above – with the general ideas of the report and think it is very helpful. Kerstin Westphal  (S&amp;D
).

 Mr President, I would like to come back to the report by Mr Cortés Lastra, which I think is a very good report. Indeed, the Cohesion policy is actually the best instrument for mobilising investment in growth and employment. However, I would like to highlight again the importance of towns and cities here, because they will play a key role in achieving the objectives of the EU 2020 strategy. Four out of five Europeans live in urban areas. Towns and cities are the driving force of economic growth in Europe. At the same time, they are experiencing many problems particularly acutely. Key words here are social integration, the environment and transport, for example, but also demographic change. Therefore, towns and cities have a particular role when it comes to actually improving the living conditions of citizens. In addition, Europe’s towns and cities are key players in the fields of innovation, research and education, and therefore play a fundamental role in the implementation of the Lisbon Strategy and the EU 2020 strategy. All of this should be taken into account during the implementation of these strategies and during the shaping of the future course of the Cohesion policy. Knut Fleckenstein  (S&amp;D

Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, in this year’s enlargement strategy, the Commission has defined the key issues very accurately. Our rapporteur has reiterated them very effectively. It is about the credibility of our policies, honesty towards the EU’s citizens and the citizens of the candidate countries, and clarity on the criteria, which must be fulfilled prior to accession. We cannot pursue policies which bypass public opinion in the EU Member States. Public opinion in many countries is sceptical towards further rounds of enlargement. It is therefore the task of policy-makers – not only the task of the Commission but our task too – to bring clarity to the accession process and to explain it more effectively at home. Any country which successfully completes the accession negotiations will have progressed through a lengthy reform process and will have incorporated many of our legal provisions into its system of governance. An improved enlargement process does not mean offering a firm timetable but creating more clarity for the steps along the road towards accession. That is why we must send out a clear signal. Firstly, we want to keep the EU’s door open to the European countries because an enlarged EU offers all of us security, democracy and prosperity. Secondly, any country embarking on the road towards accession should be able to count on support from all of us. Thirdly, however, the pace of progress towards accession will ultimately depend on how quickly the accession criteria can be fulfilled and implemented. We know from experience that ‘rebates’ are not helpful here. Let me give some advice to my German colleagues in the House and at home: we Germans should not always act as if we were expecting to have to pick up the tab at the end of the process! We have profited to such an extent from previous enlargements that I feel sure that we can look forward to the next stage in a calm and confident manner! Knut Fleckenstein  (S&amp;D

Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, WTO membership can definitely support the urgently needed modernisation of the Russian economy, through easing technology transfer and improving investment security – these are just two examples. It is just two years since Russia agreed on a partnership for modernisation with the EU for the same reasons; the declared aims of this partnership include the alignment of technical standards, the extension of investment opportunities in key sectors for innovation and growth and the general strengthening of trade relations – all these are improved by WTO accession. However, successful accession to the WTO may perhaps merely give Russia more of a voice in other international bodies. Russia will only benefit from membership of it actually implements the joint agreement on trade facilitation. A partnership with the EU for modernisation only makes sense if Russia complies with its WTO obligations. Cherry picking, WTO à la carte – there are so many pleasing expressions for what we can to some extent still see Russia doing, what Russia is doing with its membership at the moment. The EU advocated for a long time that Russia should at last be a member of the World Trade Organisation and we will prove a reliable partner to our Russian friends in the future, but this relationship cannot function in one direction only. Even the joint project, which has already taken so long, i.e. the joint partnership agreement, can now be facilitated through the WTO accession on either side, since the rules no longer have to be negotiated – they are established. However – there are two conditions: the Russians must really comply, and the EU cannot pile on more conditions. Knut Fleckenstein  (S&amp;D

 Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I would like to highlight two points. You probably cannot tell this from looking at me, but I am not a fan of punk music. We are now all familiar with one punk group and that is Pussy Riot. I see the situation slightly differently from Baroness Ashton, but the subject of whether this was a civil protest or simply hooliganism which caused deep offence to other people is open to discussion. We can perhaps even discuss what the penalty for this sort of behaviour should be. We all agree that a two-year sentence is far too long. However, what should concern us and, most importantly, what should concern the Russians in their own country is the clear indication that this trial is once again an example of the political system exerting influence on the judicial system. That is totally unacceptable. My second point concerns the NGO act, which, as has already been said, has deliberately vague wording so that it can be interpreted as required. We need to set clear boundaries. The best thing to do would be to put this act where it belongs, in other words, in the rubbish bin. However, ladies and gentlemen, there is one thing you cannot say to me, which is that we must now evaluate everything we do together with Russia. I am firmly convinced, and we discussed this 10 days ago with our Russian colleagues in St Petersburg, that the only sensible way forward is to continue to talk to them and to Russian civil society, in order to get things moving. I am not one of those who believe that a discussion of resolutions by less than 3% of the Members of the European Parliament has better prospects for success. Knut Fleckenstein  (S&amp;D

Blue-card question.

 Mr Posselt, do you also believe that the clear language spoken by this Parliament has not been as successful as we might have hoped and, therefore, that we need both approaches? We need to work together and to develop projects together, but we must also make our opinions clear in the hope that there will be progress. My second question is this. Would you be of the same opinion, as a devout Catholic, if all of this had happened in the Vatican or in your church in Munich? For you, that would probably have been the equivalent of the collapse of Western civilisation. Knut Fleckenstein  (S&amp;D

 Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, the talks between Belgrade and Priština here in Brussels were an initial success. I would like to say that this took a lot of courage on the part of Prime Minister Thaçi and President Tadić. We should recognise their courage because this is the first step in the right direction and a requirement for further positive developments. Now it is our job to show the people of Kosovo that we are serious. This is why we are supporting Ms Malmström in her commitment to visa liberalisation and why we are supporting you, Mr Füle, concerning the feasibility study for a Stabilisation and Association Agreement. You can rely on our solidarity, if you take action in this area. However, there is one thing that we should make clear, which applied in the past and will still apply in the future. Both sides must be aware that they can only make progress towards joining the EU together and in parallel. Neither side will be able to achieve this at the expense of the other. We will not tolerate that. Knut Fleckenstein  (S&amp;D

 Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I am convinced that the progress to greater democracy in Russia is no longer stoppable. I am also convinced, however, that our Parliament, our groups, the parties behind these groups and the foundations could, and must, do more to help Russia as good friends and advisors. Since the Duma elections, there have been numerous demonstrations and the involvement of civil society has increased dramatically. It is not only politicians who have taken to the streets; there are also many citizens, consisting increasingly of middle class, well-educated people and people who have educated themselves further through travel. We need to step up our dialogue and increase our contact with these people and ensure that there is more people-to-people contact, including by dealing swiftly with the outstanding issues relating to visa-free travel. However, we should step up our parliamentary dialogue now, too. I know that some people think less dialogue is the right response to the elections. I think that is wrong. We need more talks with our colleagues from the State Duma in order to discuss and to persuade and to offer them our experience. In so doing, we should present our views clearly so that our colleagues there can also learn from our experience and avoid the mistakes that we have made, and continue to make. We will best achieve this through clear dialogue and by showing as little as possible of the superior attitude that we sometimes see in this House. The Partnership for Modernisation is a good instrument for this purpose. We surely all agree that economic and technological modernisation is not sufficient and that without modernisation of the law, politics and society, Russia, and therefore our joint partnership, cannot succeed.

 Mr President, Baroness Ashton, ladies and gentlemen, the presidential elections in Russia on 4 March will show whether the government in Moscow has learnt its lesson. They will make it clear whether the processes have been improved and whether we can hold out hope that there will be positive developments in this area. However, the many demonstrations that have taken place since the beginning of December make me very hopeful. They are an indication that civil society is gaining strength and, therefore, for me they are also a sign of hope. At the same time, the large-scale demonstration due to take place on Saturday also highlights the problem faced by the Russian opposition and the protest movement. The so-called systemic opposition parties, which are represented in the Duma, are to a large extent not regarded by the population as being a viable democratic alternative. The inclusion of the nationalists in the protest movement is, thank goodness, giving rise to heated debate. I believe that we need to show solidarity in particular with those who have joined the White Ring protest over recent days and weeks. These citizens come from a wide range of different areas of society and are taking action to protect their civil rights, without having an ideological axe to grind and, most importantly, without any kind of self-interest. They do not want to form a government. Instead, they want the right to freely elect a government. This makes the movement even more convincing. What Russia most urgently needs are state institutions and elected officials who have democratic legitimacy and the trust of their voters and who make a clear commitment to serving the interests of the voters and to combating corruption and other abuses of power. Therefore, we must give this movement our support now and make it increasingly clear in our discussions with our Russian partners that we are happy to cooperate with them, but that we also want to see joint progress being made towards more democracy. Those of us who are members of the EU-Russia delegation will definitely be discussing this when we visit Moscow in eight weeks and it would be good if the Commission could play an active role in supporting the delegation. Knut Fleckenstein,  
rapporteur.

 Madam President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, I would like to start by offering my sincere thanks to the shadow rapporteurs for their very open, excellent collaboration. It was not too difficult in this case, as we are all convinced of the good and very efficient work that the European Maritime Safety Agency (EMSA) has done in the last few years. There quickly emerged a relatively homogeneous picture of what we envisage the future work of this agency to be. We also all agreed that any kind of extension of competences must either have European added value or generate clear synergy effects in the Member States. Allow me to mention just a few aspects. On 20 April 2010, we experienced the worst oil disaster in human history in the Gulf of Mexico. On 10 August 2011, there was the oil spill at the Gannet Alpha platform in the North Sea. The report on oil pollution by the Oslo-Paris Commission reveals that, in 2008, there were more than 500 oil spills at oil and gas platforms in the North Sea. It was therefore right for the Directorate-General for Energy to table a legislative package in this regard to improve the regulation of oil platforms. This includes an independent third party who is to monitor the safety of the oil platforms. Together, we should open the door for EMSA here. What European body could perform this supervisory role better? I know that EMSA does not currently have the relevant expertise. However, that is a weak argument. There are large overlaps with the areas in which EMSA currently works, and it is considerably more efficient these days to extend the available resources rather than to create entirely new ones. If the Member States now say that they are prepared to extend EMSA’s mandate and state that EMSA is now not only responsible for shipping accidents, but is also to perform the clear up following oil spills caused by drilling rigs, this will perhaps reveal a modicum of common sense, but it will certainly not be a major breakthrough. The European Parliament must focus on preventive measures. Merely cleaning up after the event is not enough. Commissioner Oettinger said that numerous facts about accidents confirm that prevention is better than trying to put things right afterwards. This statement is perhaps not particularly helpful, but it is right nevertheless. I would like to address two more points that also seem to me to be important. We need European maritime transport without borders. We have already had many debates on this subject, but there is still too little being done and too slowly for us to achieve this objective. With the help of EMSA and its recording capabilities, we can also make progress in this area. My next point is that we all know how important it is to support maritime occupations in the European Union. We cannot and do not under any circumstances want to win the competition for the lowest personnel costs and the reduction of social standards. However, when it comes to the quality of the training and further training of the seafarers, then we can play a leading role, and EMSA can and must contribute its knowledge and expertise in this regard. In committee, the report received the support of a large majority. It is intended to make it clear that Parliament takes its proposals seriously. I am confident as regards the negotiations with the Council. However, this presupposes a serious readiness to negotiate. That is what I am asking for. Knut Fleckenstein,  
rapporteur.
 – (DE)
 Madam President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, I would just like to thank those involved once again for their cooperation and also those who have just spoken for their contributions to the debate. There are naturally a few things that have not received adequate mention in our debate, as there has not been enough time – apprehending environmental polluters for example, and you mentioned piracy. I would just like to make one thing clear once again, Mr van Dalen. This report does not call for a European coastguard. We are, however, asking to finally receive the expert opinion that we want – as decided by this Parliament a long time ago – on how this coastguard should be structured and what advantages and disadvantages it would have. Mr Gallagher mentioned that EMSA saves the Member States a lot of money. That is correct. Now the issue of a coastguard could be seen as an example of the fact that we will only really have these synergy effects if we do not merely set something up jointly but if, back in our Member States, we also remember what was decided in Brussels and reduce the national structures accordingly. Only then will we see the synergy effects. Where one or two transport ministers are concerned, I have the impression that they join in the decision-making process in Brussels but then forget to tell anyone back home that adjustments need to be made as a result. I am a German MEP so I know what I am talking about. Of course, we could not regulate everything. The gender issue is something we are taking seriously. Nevertheless, it is obviously difficult to regulate the gender issue in a satisfactory way in bodies to which 27 Member States each send one person. As regards competences – whether national or regional – we sometimes had the feeling in committee that this was a Spanish domestic discussion. It is all the same to me whether it is national or regional. The authorities must be the competent authorities, and that is what will make them the right points of contact. How the competence is determined is up to others at a local level. My final point is that EMSA contains an ‘S’ for ‘safety’, you are absolutely right about that. However, Ms Foster, if you believe that as far as oil platforms are concerned, there are particularly good regulations in place, then I would remind you once again of what I said earlier: 500 accidents on oil and gas drilling rigs in 2008 show that we really need to consider how we can improve this situation and perhaps also integrate this within an agency that already deals with similar problems. Knut Fleckenstein  (S&amp;D
). 
 – (DE)
 Madam President, Baroness Ashton, I can only endorse what Ms Oomen-Ruijten has said about the elections. We very much want to make it clear to the Russian President that his announcements must be followed by actions and that we will take him exactly at his word. I think that what Mr Swoboda has said is right. We should hold a major hearing for everyone involved, once the OSCE Office for Democratic Institutions and Human Rights (ODIHR) has submitted its report. Therefore, I think it is wrong to call for new elections now, before the report is available. I would just like to say one thing to Mr Kelam, but unfortunately he is no longer here. Perhaps it is simply an error in the interpreting. He said that the demonstrators in Moscow represent an opportunity for us. I do not believe that this is right. It is not an opportunity for us, but an opportunity for the people of Russia. We need to be careful about what we say. Elections will be an important topic of conversation at the summit, but this can also be a summit which gives confidence. There are two positive points which I would like to mention briefly. One is accession to the World Trade Organisation (WTO) after 18 years of negotiations. This not only clarifies the rules, but could also make a new agreement with us easier, hopefully in future prevent the unilateral trade restrictions that there have been in the past, and alleviate the repeated pressure caused by the Siberian overflight rights. The second and final point that I want to touch on briefly is the question of visas and free movement. We are pleased that a regulation will be put in place on the border traffic to and from Kaliningrad. That will really make the situation easier for people in Poland and in Kaliningrad in particular. The joint steps which the two countries aim to agree on and which have been carefully prepared will hopefully, with good will on both sides, lead to a regulation on visa-free travel at some point. We will be discussing modernisation, human rights and the development of a civil society and we want to achieve sensible, positive results. However, without personal contacts, none of this will succeed. Knut Fleckenstein,  
on behalf of the S&amp;D Group.

 Mr President, Baroness Ashton, ladies and gentlemen, I shall be brief, because the subject of Russia comes round every four weeks and I stand by the opinion that I expressed four weeks ago. Yes, we regret the fact that yet again, parties in Russia, most recently the liberal party, are not approved and therefore cannot stand for public election. I am convinced that no nation in the world will put up with this in the long term. I am also convinced that our Partnership for Modernisation could be implemented much more effectively if the Russian Government could allay concerns about democratic shortcomings and the rule of law with bold decisions. Until such time as that happens, we shall not let this subject rest, also because we believe that it is in the interest of our partner, in other words, Russia itself. For my part, I should also like to add that I am equally convinced that we can achieve a great deal more by stepping up our talks and our cooperation than by adopting monthly resolutions, however appropriate these may be. Human rights and democracy are indivisible. Our public contribution to this is important, our criticism of Russia is justified, but we would be even more credible if we were to identify the shortcomings within the EU with the same honesty and acuity and perhaps even more unanimously than before. As long as Members of this House maintain – as they did yesterday – that modern Hungary is a model democracy, then, what my fellow Member from the European People’s Party (Christian Democrats) said continues to apply: that the self-righteousness of some Members of this House is hair-raising. I agree with that. I am not saying this to please anyone in Moscow, but because I am firmly convinced that we can make a much more effective contribution than we are making at present. (The speaker agreed to take a blue-card question under Rule 149(8)) Knut Fleckenstein  (S&amp;D
). 
 – (DE)
 Mr Migalski, you are absolutely right. The two things cannot be compared. However, I believe that you enhance your credibility by dealing with the problems in your own backyard – quite irrespective of any criticism, including of Moscow. My second point is that, while we are perfectly entitled to criticise Moscow, the question must be how we can most effectively help bring about some kind of change. I am convinced that that will not be achieved through repeated resolutions. Knut Fleckenstein  (S&amp;D
). 
 – (DE)
 Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I would just like to mention two points because Mr Swoboda has already mentioned a number of points on behalf of our group. Russia is indeed at an important crossroads. Its internal political situation will be determined by the elections to the Duma in December and the question of who will continue the modernisation embarked upon as president from 2012. One can also put a positive slant on this. There could be no better opportunity to strengthen international confidence in Russia’s development. This is conditional upon there being fair elections, fair opportunities for registration and access to the media for the candidates, to ensure at least an element of equal opportunity. My second point concerns the Partnership for Modernisation between the EU and Russia. This opens up new opportunities for effective cooperation. We should therefore not miss the opportunity to support Russia vigorously in this modernisation – not just by investing in the modernisation of the economy, but also in its society. Governments put things down on paper and, as we all know, you can say what you like on paper. Citizens, however, become very restless if what is stated on paper is not implemented. Civil participation and the involvement of civil society, entrepreneurs, researchers, young people and artists are essential to a self-determined society of solidarity. We can only successfully support such modernisation, however, if people can come together easily in order to learn from each other and exchange experiences. For these reasons, the EU and Russia should finally reach agreement on the common steps that need to be taken to achieve visa-free travel and how these can be implemented, in order to achieve results as quickly as possible. We have been talking about people in the Kaliningrad region and thinking about facilitation. A month ago, this House decided that visa facilitation should be allowed for cultural purposes. We have been talking about whether perhaps particular consideration should be given to young people here. These are all good suggestions to get the ball rolling, but they are no substitute for an overall solution. I would therefore urge the Commission to step up the pace. You can count on our support in any case, including as regards some of the more hesitant certain Member States. (Applause) Knut Fleckenstein  (S&amp;D
). 
 – (DE)
 Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, through its report on the cultural dimensions of the EU’s external actions, Parliament clarifies its aspiration to also put our own stamps on this developing policy field. The fact – and I want to put this carefully – that I do not see a representative of the External Action Service here today shows how necessary this report is. The report quite rightly urges that, in future, cultural aspects should play a more significant role in external policy, into which they should be more systematically incorporated. For my group, it was important to call for a coherent strategy that more effectively coordinates existing EU external policy programmes with cultural components, thereby taking account of cultural diversity in the EU. Mrs Pack has already made reference to this, saying that the existing structures in the Member States and between them, such as the EUNIC network of national institutes for culture, must be incorporated and that civil society must be seen as part of European external cultural policy. The EU’s motto of ‘United in diversity’ should also come to bear on the image that the Union projects to the outside world. We should also make even better use of the new media as a communications platform to that end. As we do all this, we need to make sure that art and culture do not become means to an end in external policy. It is our cultural values that characterise our European Community. It is therefore important and right that this cultural diversity and identity should also be disseminated outside the Union by its policies. I feel sure that we can achieve much more in this way, including in the debate about human rights and democracy, than through many cases of sabre-rattling, sometimes with absolutely nothing to back it up, in this House. Knut Fleckenstein  (S&amp;D
). 
 – (DE)
 Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I regret the fact that this debate was put on the agenda at such short notice that the High Representative for Foreign Affairs and Security Policy was not able to be here. In recent months, Baroness Ashton has worked with the Council to improve internal EU coordination on cooperation with our strategic partners, including Russia. With regard to her efforts to achieve a coordinated position, I think it would have been sensible to involve her in this debate. None of the other strategic partners of the EU is as close to us as Russia, either geographically or in relation to our historic experiences. This is why we take great interest in the internal political developments in Russia. At this point, I would like to make specific mention of the work programme drawn up jointly by the coordinators of the Partnership for Modernisation, both in Russia and in the EU. This joint work programme for modernisation contains important measures which will provide active support for the development of the rule of law in Russia. This is the right way of ensuring that our partnership brings real benefits, in particular, for the citizens. The initiative to modernise Russia launched by the Russian President gives the country’s international partners the opportunity to begin a fruitful cooperation with Russia. We must make use of this opportunity. As my fellow Members have already said, if the modernisation process is to be sustainable, it must not only be based on technological developments. A modern Russian economy must be founded on the reliable principles of the rule of law. Only when citizens and business people can rely on the rule of law will they have the courage to introduce innovations and make investments. Let us take the hand that Russia has reached out to us and help the country to modernise. Knut Fleckenstein  (S&amp;D
).

– Madam President, I will vote for the resolution, yes. Knut Fleckenstein  (S&amp;D
). 
 – (DE)
 Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I would simply like to make three brief points, on behalf also of some of my colleagues on the Committee on Transport and Tourism. These are critical points that I would ask the representatives of the Commission to bring up in their discussions. The first is that although it has already been passed, the travel promotion tax is an unacceptable unilateral decision by the US Government. We hope that you can persuade it to think again on this. Secondly, the exclusion of Romania, Poland, Bulgaria and Cyprus from the visa waiver programme is something that the European Parliament cannot endorse, and, in our opinion, it should not be allowed to continue. Thirdly, we welcome the joint efforts to elaborate international security standards and to develop smart security concepts, but unilateral stipulations such as compulsory container scanning are not a solution because they are one-sided and disproportionate. The costs are out of all proportion to the benefit and it is unreasonable to expect this of European ports and enterprises. Knut Fleckenstein,  
on behalf of the S&amp;D Group

 Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, firstly I would like to congratulate Mrs Meissner on her report and thank her for all her hard work. We share the approach taken by this report which puts the focus not on the sectoral structure of maritime policy in the individual Member States, but instead emphasises the importance of coordinating maritime policy within and across the Member States. If we look to the future, we will see the space available in our seas and oceans becoming more restricted. The oceans are transport routes, sources of raw materials and energy, suppliers of foodstuffs and water reservoirs. The economic exploitation of the oceans is growing and this brings an accompanying increase in the environmental impact on them. Conflicts of interest will arise and we will have to resolve them by means of effective coordination within and among countries. It is not possible to comment on every issue, but I would like to mention briefly the sulphur emission control areas. It was not my intention to make the limits less strict. When the Commission presents its study, we will be able to tell to what extent the limits will result in a shift from sea to road transport, in particular in the North Sea and the Baltic. Then we can discuss this issue further. However, the basic conditions for competition within the European Union between the North and the South must remain at the same level. This must also be one of the Commission’s objectives. There is one point which we are not entirely happy about. We have been talking for a long time about the strategic importance of the shipbuilding industry in Europe. We have also said that innovation is very important in this industry, because this is the only way that it can survive. We need a coordinated strategy for our policy on the shipbuilding industry. I believe that the call from the Member States to put funding aside for shipbuilding was also very important, but it has not been supported by the Liberals and the Conservatives. Ladies and gentlemen, how do you propose that we should support the shipbuilding industry in Europe? Coming out with platitudes and good wishes for the workers in the European shipyards, who are concerned about their jobs, is simply not enough. We Social Democrats expect better measures and better proposals in this area. Knut Fleckenstein  (S&amp;D
). 
 – (DE)
 Mr President, I would just like to interrupt the debate very briefly to inform you and my fellow Members that last night, three terrorists stormed the Chechen Parliament, killing several security officers and taking hostages. The terrorists were also killed. Parliament ought to express its condemnation of this act of terrorism in no uncertain terms, because terrorism can never be justified. Our sympathy goes out to the families. I wanted to mention this briefly, especially in view of the fact that we will be discussing the Northern Caucasus again this week. I apologise for the interruption. Knut Fleckenstein  (S&amp;D
). 
 – (DE)
 Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I am pleased that we will be able to adopt this report with a large majority tomorrow. There are two things that I regard as being particularly important. The first is ensuring that the objectives we have set ourselves for 2020 can be measured. We need measurable principles which will allow us to take stock after ten years or, even better, halfway through the period, so that we can identify whether we have achieved some of what we set out to do or whether things have not worked out and we need to make improvements. This applies in particular to CO2
 emissions in the transport sector. If all the other sectors are making good progress, as Mr Cramer has said, then we can rightly call on the transport industry to do the same. European transport policy is of particular importance when it comes to reducing CO2
 emissions. The second point concerns the implementation of efficient comodality. For me, this is the key to a sensible EU transport strategy. I say this, because efficient comodality can have a number of different meanings. If we do not base this theoretical concept on the right criteria, which can be put into practice, we will not achieve our objective. Therefore, I am once again calling on the Commission to ensure that the concept is implemented correctly down to the last detail, which means developing useful intermodal nodes and removing the bottlenecks in the transport of goods to and from important European trade gateways. This particularly applies to the links between major ports and airports and their hinterlands. My third point is that the proposed core Trans-European Network (TEN) must be based on the same criteria, so that there is an almost automatic modal shift towards an efficient and environmentally friendly European transport system. These are the factors that make up a sensible plan. Not just cost effectiveness, but also social compatibility, environmental protection and sustainability. Mr Grosch and Mrs Alvarez, thank you very much for all your hard work. Knut Fleckenstein  (S&amp;D
). 
 – (DE)
 Madam President, Baroness Ashton, ladies and gentlemen, the EU-Russia Summit has produced reasonable results, in particular, as far as specifying the details of the Partnership for Modernisation is concerned. I very much welcome the fact that dialogue between the civil societies has been seen as a priority in this partnership. As the chair of the European Parliament delegation for relations with Russia, I led a working group meeting in Perm a few days ago specifically on the subject of developing the civil society. We have once again seen how much progress has been made in Russia in recent years, but also how much still remains to be done and how much we can contribute to the discussions on the basis of our experiences, both good and otherwise. Exchange and movement are key concepts for me. There can be no Partnership for Modernisation without the movement of people. For this reason, I am rather disappointed that the EU has not really made much progress in the area of travel without visas. We must now set specific objectives which the EU and Russia can work together to achieve. This is not about meeting schedules and certainly not about following certain sequences of events. It is all about ensuring that we take a predictable approach to these issues, that the criteria are clearly defined and that everyone, including Russia, can be sure that when these conditions are fulfilled and when the specific problems are solved, visa liberalisation will be possible. Knut Fleckenstein,  
on behalf of the S&amp;D Group. 
– (DE)
 Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, first of all, we very much welcome the fact that, in future, we will have a maritime strategy in the EU, even if we will have to wait a little longer for the vote. We assume that this report will be incorporated into the Future of Transport report and then into the White Paper. Through the European Maritime Transport Strategy 2018, we are creating the framework to make the European maritime economy more competitive at international level, and in this strategy we have determined, firstly, that we want this framework to be set up on the basis of ecological standards and, secondly, that we want sensible global social standards for high quality shipping. Let me briefly address three points. Firstly, shipping is an environmentally friendly transport sector and therefore, one of our aims was for this branch of the economy to play its part in combating climate change in future, too. I am very much in favour of us creating incentives like the green ports, even if we do not make any decisions today but rather assign the Commission and the Council the task of finding out what is possible in this regard. I believe it is just as important to maintain international competitiveness – including in respect of other modes of transport. It is therefore also right for the Commission, on the basis of our proposal, to once again carry out an impact assessment in respect of the sulphur emission control areas in the North Sea and the Baltic Sea because, if we want higher requirements here than elsewhere, we need to take international competition into account and ensure that, if possible, we do not cause the transport of containers to move back to the roads, which would be counterproductive. Allow me to mention one last thing that I feel is particularly important, namely the inclusion of the major European ports in the planning of the TEN networks. This is of such enormous importance to us because the ports are important intersections in the transport chains and they can only perform their role effectively if intermodality is facilitated and reinforced. There are numerous other points that I could mention here. Mr van Dalen, congratulations on this excellent report. We have all contributed a little to it and I would ask for your understanding for the fact that we do not want to spoil this excellent report by accepting your amendments. Knut Fleckenstein  (S&amp;D

 – (DE)
 Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, the previous speakers have already clearly highlighted many points and problems, such as the human rights situation. It is important for us to make these points clearly, as only then will we be able to have an open and frank debate. If Russia is currently once again seriously discussing introducing the death penalty according to the US model, we cannot neglect to express our opinion on this. I have two brief points to make. My first point relates to Russia’s accession to the WTO and my sincere request, including to the Council and the Commission, is to provide as much support as possible for this. Of course, Russia must play its part, too, but we are both relying on this and it would be good for both of us if developments in this regard were to move in a positive direction. The fact that Russia wants to join the WTO and not just enter into a customs union with Belarus and Kazakhstan is a step in the right direction. My second point is a sincere request for us not to lose sight of the development of our cooperation in the areas of science and research as well as in the area of civil society. We need a new impetus for cultural exchange as well as youth exchanges, not only in one direction, as Mr Gahler said, but in both directions. Every young person who takes part in this will develop an understanding for others and will become a messenger for a more positive development of our relations. I hope that we will talk more about these common interests and that these aspects will also assume greater importance. Matthias Groote,  
rapporteur.

Mr President, Commissioner, President-in-Office of the Council, ladies and gentlemen, it is a well-established and fine tradition that we adopt a joint resolution in advance of climate conferences and prepare the delegation. Yesterday, we held a final meeting which was attended by the Commissioner and also the President of this House. My colleagues with experience in these matters tell me this was a first! With his contribution, the President sent out a strong signal that the full backing of the House is ensured and that we are taking on an important role in relation to COP 18, in that we will be holding discussions with as many international representatives as possible there and will also exercising our powers of persuasion. That really is essential. We hope that after tomorrow, we will be able to take with us a strong resolution that offers clear solutions. We have a duty to provide answers, for climate change can only be combated and halted through international cooperation. The conference in Doha will take place from 26 November to 7 December, and I am keen to see which positions China will adopt and which positions the US will adopt now that the President has been returned to office for a second term. How will they position themselves, and how will we then respond to the issues raised, and so on?  We have just held an interesting debate about Europe’s financial future. This debate is relevant to us in Doha as well, for as is well-known, friendship stops where money begins. Where climate change is concerned, however, friendship begins in earnest. We must find answers to the question of how the fast-start period will continue to be financed after 2012. A great deal of money will be required here. However, it is important to emphasise, as always, that the deceptive aspect of climate change is that its effects are not felt immediately. Even if we were to adopt a decision tomorrow that CO2
 emissions will be reduced by 50 % immediately, the effects would not be felt until very much later. Climate change and the financial crisis therefore have one feature in common: they will both cost a great deal of money.  If we continue to prevaricate, also in the international arena, and do not manage to find a workable way forward in Doha, this will prove very costly for the international community and is likely to have extremely adverse effects for a great many people. It may even cost lives. Failure, therefore, is not an option. However, we should not demand too much, that much is clear. At previous conferences, we learned that we have to take small steps. However, the largest step that the industrialised nations must take is to deal with the future financing and safeguards for adaptation measures and climate action. Clearly, we remain committed to the 2° target. However, with a ‘business as usual’ approach, 3.5° or 4° is the more likely outcome, and no expert in the world can tell us the exact number of degrees at which we cause irreparable damage to the planet.  I am most grateful to the Commissioner. Last week, we held a lengthy debate on how we wish to proceed internally with our emissions trading scheme. However, there is movement at the international level as well, and this applies to various sectors. I welcome the fact that we appear to be on track, here in the EP, towards a solution for aviation, which I hope will be achieved as quickly as possible, ideally before the conference. However, aviation is an international business, and if there is the possibility of achieving a global agreement here, we should stop the clock, as the Commissioner has rightly pointed out, but of course only for a short time. In that case, it is essential to ensure that the international negotiations produce a genuinely workable arrangement, with a workable decision being taken by the International Civil Aviation Organisation (ICAO), resulting in an international agreement. Otherwise, the clocks will start ticking again in autumn next year and the legislation will proceed. I would also like to respond to the fellow Members who described this as ‘giving way’. Let me say this: ‘giving way’ looks very different. I believe this was a wise decision which this House should support. I believe it sends out a signal for the debates in Doha and shows, once again, that we are willing to compromise here. A further important point relates to climate diplomacy, which the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Food Safety included in the resolution. This means that we are following this issue at all levels, including the European External Action Service (EEAS), and it is always a topic of discussion at all the international meetings. The parliamentary delegation is very well prepared. I very much hope that everyone, including the Commission, will ensure that the parliamentary delegation is fully involved in all the daily briefings so that we have a lively exchange. Our role in Doha will be to convince as many people as possible in positions of responsibility outside the European Union that our ideas are the right ones, and advocate for a global agreement, so that a second commitment period can begin. That is crucial in order to combat climate change and achieve successes. Matthias Groote  (S&amp;D

Mr President, the timing of today’s session leaves something to be desired. I have never experienced us being over an hour late before. In this regard, blue cards should indeed be used freely, but should also not be misused.  With regard to fracking, the debate reminds me a little of that relating to nuclear power – yes or no. I must say, however, that just because something is technically possible, that does not mean it has to be done. The protection of health and the environment must therefore take absolute priority over any immature technologies, and that is what I see when it comes to fracking. My greatest reservations concern the impact on the environment. What we are lacking is a sensible regulatory framework. We have various policy areas: Member States are responsible for the energy mix, but we are responsible for environmental policy. We have gaps in the water framework legislation. We have no mining law. I believe it is appropriate and timely for the Commission to think about how we can close these gaps, to create legal certainty and to ensure maximum protection for health and the environment. This – as I see it, anyway – is not the case with regard to fracking! A potential energy supply of the future cannot, however, be created at the cost of the environment or health. Furthermore, if you look at how many accidents and risks there are in the United States with the 50 000 existing well-bores, I must say that we should give careful consideration to how we get involved in this technology and what the protective framework for this future technology should be. Matthias Groote  (S&amp;D

Mr President, last Wednesday, the Nordseewerke shipyard in Emden had to file for bankruptcy because, to its surprise, a guarantee by the Lower Saxon Land Government was not extended. That undertaking, with 700 skilled jobs, is in the process of transforming from a shipyard to a supplier of offshore wind energy. And it is now thought that this undertaking can be saved by a large loan and that the jobs can also be saved, for the 700 SIAG and Nordseewerke workers have already had to accept substantial cuts in their pay. That is why I ask the Commission to take a favourable and also an early look at this procedure, to ensure that these 700 jobs are not put at risk, because they are needed in order to organise the energy revolution and sustainable energy on the seas of Europe. Please do not let the workers there suffer from the Land government’s poor crisis management. Matthias Groote  (S&amp;D

 Mr President, air quality is an important topic in the European Union, particularly in the coming year, which is the Year of Air. We should take heed of this and work to ensure that progress is made in this area. However, we also have to take into account the fact that maritime transport is currently facing one of its most severe crises. I have major concerns regarding the technology that is to be used to provide clean air. In this area, we must make sure – and that includes in the financial perspective – that alternatives are pointed out. As my fellow Member has just said, LNG is a very good alternative in the Sulphur Emission Control Areas (SECAs). However, for this we need research and development. It is also an economic recovery plan for our shipyards, particularly in the case of scrubber technology, which has not got that far yet. I sometimes get the feeling that some of my fellow Members believe that the required technology is just sitting on the shelf waiting to be used. It is not. I would therefore like to see greater focus on promoting technology, so that we really can have clean air in our ports and port cities. Please would you also pay heed to who foots the bill at the end of the day. Matthias Groote  (S&amp;D
).

 Mr President, the best kind of energy is energy that is not used in the first place. We are not talking here about saving energy, but about using energy more efficiently. There is one aspect of this where I would like us to have gone further, and that is in the public sector. There is huge potential here, a huge backlog of investments among our local authorities. I would have liked to have seen Parliament being more ambitious in this regard. We have pushed through this procedure, partly unnecessarily. One Member – one of the shadow rapporteurs – has mentioned it already; I even thought he wanted to vote against the whole compromise. If it is all so terrible, why did he then not push for a second reading? I would have liked the community to take such an important matter to second reading, so that the whole package could be discussed with the chambers and guilds. Greater transparency in this area would really have done us good. That is what I would like to see happen next time. The rapporteurs have made their decision, but I would like to remind Members that two readings are actually the rule in this House. In this parliamentary term, it has become the exception. We should take that to heart and think about it sometime. Matthias Groote  (S&amp;D

 Mr President, we debated the preparations for the Rio+20 conference intensively in our respective bodies within the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Food Safety. It must be said however, that, in the final analysis, the result achieved in Rio is fairly unimpressive. Mr Prodi expressed our disappointment in a nutshell, calling it Rio minus 20! Some NGOs described the result the same way. What has been achieved in the conference is really very little indeed. Firstly, we need to consider whether there is much point holding conferences in this format. We have been through Copenhagen, which was a disaster, and now we have had Rio+20: we are moving from one disappointment to the next. I think that the upgrading of the UN Environment Programme, putting it on an almost equal footing with the WHO, is the right approach, as it will give this organisation more authority and more enforcement powers than was previously the case. This is a very important point. We are going to witness the world’s population grow to 9 billion. We are heading for a catastrophe if things keep going like this. If more and more people live in industrialised nations and want access to energy and if we do not take radical steps to avert this, we shall encounter enormous problems. That is why we need a new development strategy. There has been no public debate on this issue, even in advance of Rio. When I consider what we voted on yesterday – ACTA – and the number of e-mails and letters, etc. we received on this issue, then I believe that we also need to move towards a sustainable planet in the digital community too. After all, this world is the only one we have got. We can play our part here by changing our strategy and bringing more people along with us, and then perhaps the Angela Merkels of this world will travel to the next summit and really put their heads together to produce concrete results. Matthias Groote  (S&amp;D
). 
 – (DE) 
Mr President, I would also like to express my sincere thanks to the shadow rapporteurs and the rapporteur. This report was adopted by the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Food Safety with an absolute majority of 62 votes in favour, no votes against and no abstentions. This shows that we are actually very much at one with regard to the compromises. Of course, we must give the greatest priority in this legislative process to the provision of high level consumer protection for the younger members of society, in other words children, who need special consideration. Gluten intolerance is a problem, particularly in nurseries. If we look around us – I myself have two children in this age group – we will be aware of the allergies and intolerances that arise, which is why I believe that we have chosen the right approach. We should continue to discuss this in the second reading, also involving the Council and Commission. I believe that we will then also achieve positive results. Matthias Groote  (S&amp;D
). 
 – (DE)
 Mr President, Seveso, Enschede, Toulouse – these places are synonymous with major disasters that result not just in environmental disaster, but also in loss of life and the destruction of private property. That is why we must do everything we can to reduce the risk, as well as the likelihood, of such accidents being repeated. How do we do that? Firstly, we must allow even unscheduled inspections, and it must not be simply routine. The people who live close to such industrial establishments must be very well informed of what is going on there, what happens there. In the event of an incident, we must make sure that the situation is clarified promptly. This is very important, because it can save human lives. I think the Council has not done itself any favours here. I also think the Council should be here for this debate in Parliament. Apparently, however, other things are more important. I think the Council might have saved face if it had explained why this legislation has been watered down. That is what I would have liked to see. However, strong legislation in this area will also create confidence. This confidence is needed when the Member States plan large infrastructure projects. At such times, there are always major reservations among the population. Strong legislation here, such as we have achieved today, creates confidence; and that is only possible where there is the greatest possible degree of transparency. It also requires authorities to be better networked with each other, to cooperate more with each other; we also need more communication, and dealing with such large, dangerous establishments must never become routine. We must not allow that to happen. Matthias Groote  (S&amp;D
),  
Blue-card question
. – (DE)
 A blue card, because we have now heard a great many critical voices. I know that Mr Seeber has dealt with the procedure in Parliament very well, having taken this over from János Áder. My question is simply: we are now concluding this at first reading, as we do for as much as 65% of our environmental legislation. My question to the rapporteur is whether we might not perhaps have been able to achieve greater transparency, even though the Council took a blocking attitude, if we had taken it to a second reading? This is a fundamental issue. Richard, I realise that you took this over. However, I would like to hear the current rapporteur’s view on this. Matthias Groote  (S&amp;D
). 
 – (DE)
 Mr President, Commissioner, rapporteur, shadow rapporteur, the spirit is willing, but the flesh is weak. That is what you could say about resource conservation. Everyone wants to move in the right direction, but how do we get there? Voluntary measures – as we have seen time and time again, in the automotive industry, in other areas – have been a resounding failure. Resource efficiency and the conservation of resources are an element of foreign policy, security policy, health policy, environmental policy, economic policy, agricultural policy – they affect all areas. Looking at the empty Council benches, I can only say that I am astonished that the Council is not here today, but perhaps things will take a bit longer, because they are missing something today – namely, the presentation and debate on a very, very good report by Mr Gerbrandy. This topic is by no means dealt with yet, and this matter will decide whether Europe lives in prosperity in future and what our environment in Europe will look like. It is now a matter of finding the instruments. The internalisation of external costs – there is no way around it: this principle must be introduced. Anyone who pollutes water or air must pay for it. At the moment, we pay for it via our health insurance or through other areas – we are paying for it with our taxes, Ms Gardini. This has to be internalised, and here we need to be courageous for once, because only then will we deal with the future challenges that we face. A growing world population – not in Europe, we will get smaller in the future – is a huge challenge, and therefore this report that Mr Gerbrandy has produced is a good starting point for considering new political strategies, and that applies to the Commission, too. We have to think in terms of life cycles – instead of simply regulating what comes out of the exhaust, we also need to look at the factory where the car is manufactured. Is that sustainable, does it conserve resources? We must think in terms of complete cycles and be courageous about this and not stick with the status quo
 – because if we do, we will pay very, very dearly for it. (Applause) Matthias Groote  (S&amp;D
). 
 – (DE) 
Madam President, firstly, I would like to congratulate Mr Gerbrandy. This is a very good report and it gives us guidelines as to how we should act in forthcoming legislative procedures and during major reform processes. The litmus test will come when we discuss agricultural reform. Many of the speeches today have already made this clear. This is where we will have the opportunity to do more to promote biodiversity and to show our other partners, for example, at the Rio+20 conference, that we take this subject seriously. The Heads of State or Government agreed in 2001 that biodiversity must be protected. Unfortunately, we have failed to achieve this objective. The window of opportunity is gradually closing and it is time for us to act. The problem will not be resolved solely by this strategy. The whole issue must be incorporated into the reform of fisheries and agriculture policy and given a more concrete form. Matthias Groote  (S&amp;D
).  
– (DE)
 Mr President, it is important that resource efficiency is also included in the 7th Environment Action Programme (EAP), which is what we have been discussing today. I hope that we will vote in plenary in the same way as we voted in the committee and that the Rio+20 conference will be a great success. Following the discussions with the environment ministers this week, I am in a very positive mood. We should design the 7th EAP accordingly and include the concrete decisions which we hope will be made in Rio, in other words, the international dimension. As far as doing business sustainably is concerned, we need to introduce an end-to-end approach, for example, in car manufacturing. We must consider the car from production right through to recycling. To achieve this, we need a legislative framework. The 7th EAP is a good location for this framework, which can then be applied when the relevant legislation is revised. Matthias Groote  (S&amp;D
). 
 – (DE)
 Mr President, we are discussing the changeover to a low-emissions economy. We have heard a number of people today tell us that we should continue as before. Mr Davies’ report contains an important point: if we continue as before, this will cost 5% of gross domestic product in the future. A full 5% of gross domestic product if we continue as before! Accordingly, the contents of the report represent a start. Naturally we are only responsible for 12% of emissions. However, if someone does not make a start, no one will. There will be a battle for resources and the lower our emissions in the future, the fewer raw materials we will consume. There will also be a radical economic impact if we fail to take evasive action, investing in renewable energies and reducing emissions from traffic. We have made a start here. This is a difficult path, both within the EU and internationally, which is why we need more diplomatic activity around climate issues. The European External Action Service needs to play its part in ensuring more is done with regard to climate-related diplomacy. We resolved here to include aviation in the Emissions Trading System. At present this is encountering international resistance – to put things diplomatically. Nonetheless, we are on the right track. If the US, Russia and India develop a similar system, then we will of course be willing to cooperate with them and to show them the hand of friendship. Nonetheless, someone has to make a start. That is what we have done. It will also be evident in economic terms that we made a start in good time. This is a good report and everyone in the Chamber today bears some responsibility in making this report a success. We cannot afford for the report to fail, like its predecessor, the Eickhout report. That would be a completely destructive signal to the citizens of Europe and the world’s public at large. Hence my call to all my fellow Members: each of us must move a little from our positions if this report is to be a success. Matthias Groote,

 Mr President, I am grateful to the Commissioner for the opportunity to debate this important topic today. In my country, Germany, 900 holdings are affected by the Schmallenberg virus and the numbers are growing. Naturally there are also signs of fear in the public debate in relation to the agricultural sector, ranging from loss of income to complete loss of livelihood, as well as public health concerns. After all, it is not possible to offer a 100% guarantee that this virus will not affect humans. The European Food Safety Authority has already announced that it wishes to work closely with the European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control in order to keep a close eye on the impact on public health. I believe that this is very important. A monitoring procedure does exist and has been simulated once by EFSA. We have just heard that eight Member States have been affected by this disease so far, and our fears are that the outbreak will spread as the flying insect population increases in spring and summer. A number of different scenarios have been identified. Can the Commission indicate precisely what steps it will take to combat the situations revealed in the simulation? Perhaps you are still at the analysis stage? This is a very important point. It is also important that the general public should see that steps are being taken to control this disease. I am aware that this is something new, and that we do not have specific means for combating this disease. Nonetheless, I would ask what steps is the Commission planning, or has it already taken to ensure that this disease does not spread to all 27 Member States? Eight countries are affected so far and we do not want to see the disease spread to all 27 Member States. Matthias Groote  (S&amp;D

 Madam President, Mr Duff has presented us with a visionary and – as he said himself – radical proposal for the reform of the electoral system. I believe that that is a good thing; we need proposals and we need more Europe in European politics. However, the reality currently looks rather different: 18 fellow Members are still waiting to be able to come here to Parliament and we are already talking about expanding Parliament by another 25 Members. I think it is good that this report, most of which I support, will be debated once again in the Committee on Constitutional Affairs and that we will then adopt this Duff report here with a broad majority the third time around, because we need a uniform electoral system. I would like to share many of Mr Duff’s visions with him. Hopefully, we will adopt the final report in the second half of this year and then also implement it. However, I believe that we need a broad majority, not just a slight majority, because then we will really make ourselves heard with this proposal. Matthias Groote,

 Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, firstly I would like to thank the rapporteur and all those involved in this process because tomorrow, after the vote, a long period of hard work will finally come to a conclusion. This is a good day for Europe, for the European Parliament as an institution, and for the Commission because we have succeeded in getting a common transparency register off the ground. This an important step along the way, but more work needs to be done. I would like to address two points. The first is that the register is not really mandatory. This needs to be stated openly at this point. I have a question for the Commissioner in this regard: the Commission has always claimed that the appropriate legal framework for this does not exist. Is the Commission ready to establish such a legal framework, so that we will have a mandatory register after the revision? I was very pleased by the statement from the Council indicating that it does not foresee any difficulty in joining our register, as Mr Weber has just pointed out. I am hopeful that the Council will follow through on this, because the register will really only be complete if all three institutions of the European Union have a common register and if this register is also mandatory. As a group, we favour the amendment brought forward by another group requiring that the money spent on lobbying should also be listed in the transparency register; we intend supporting this amendment. As far as the various national lobby groups are concerned, it has been clearly stated that these will not be included in the register. I would like to thank all my fellow Members for their willingness to compromise on this matter. It really would have been a black mark for such an agreement if national lobby groups were treated in the same way as industry lobbyists or other professional associations. Matthias Groote  (S&amp;D

Madam President, I would like to thank Mr Duff for bringing up the issue of the legislative footprint. Do you believe that a legislative footprint, the extent of which still has to be defined, might also restrict the work of the European Parliament? Also: how far-reaching do you expect the impact of the legislative footprint to be? Matthias Groote,  
on behalf of the S&amp;D Group.
 – (DE)
 Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I would like to start by expressing my gratitude for the way in which we have been able to work together so constructively. We have reached a good compromise today from an environmental and an economic perspective. Even though we could, in my opinion, have gone further with regard to the limit, the legislation that we are adopting today is still the strictest in the world for light commercial vehicles. We must not forget that. Mrs Hedegaard has already said that, outside the Emissions Trading System, these small sector-specific pieces of legislation which we are introducing are very important in allowing us to achieve the goals that we have set ourselves. If vehicles use less fuel, this brings added value not only for the climate but also for air quality. With a limit of 147 grams, which is the equivalent of 5.6 litres of diesel, vehicles will produce less pollution. This means that the air quality in our cities will improve. We are taking an important step forward today. My group is voting in favour of this compromise package because it includes an important point which states that we must evaluate in 2014 at the latest whether the targets that we are adopting today have been met or exceeded and whether we need to make adjustments in this area. This was a fundamental requirement for our group. I have had long discussions with my colleague, Mr Pirillo, about the nature of this compromise and that was one of the basic prerequisites of the compromise package. Some comments have already been made about the first reading. We should make sure in future that we reach fewer first-reading agreements. In this case, it is acceptable because the negotiations ultimately only concerned 2 grams. We did not need to introduce that into the second reading. However, if we adopt everything during the first reading, Parliament will be depriving itself of its rights. There is one further point I would like to mention and that is the test cycle. It will be very important for us to have a standardised test cycle in future which will hopefully come into force throughout the world at some point and which will represent reality. Our current test cycles are not realistic and we need to make improvements in this area. International negotiations are under way and I hope that they can be brought to successful conclusion, because this will mean that the legislation will reflect the actual driving cycles. I would like to thank everyone concerned once again. Today is a good day for the European Union’s climate and environmental policy. Matthias Groote  (S&amp;D
).

Madam President, firstly I would like to thank everyone who has made this possible and, in particular, the former vice-president Sylvia-Yvonne Kaufmann, who did much of the preliminary work during the previous parliamentary term to ensure that the day would come when the European citizens’ initiative would become reality. Sometimes the citizens of the EU feel as if Europe and its institutions are very remote. This instrument, the European citizens’ initiative, will bring the institutions closer to the citizens. This is an excellent instrument which will strengthen democracy, involve people more and enable them to take the initiative. I believe that two things will be very important over the next few months. One is creating access, including digital access, to the citizens’ initiative over the Internet in a way which makes it easy to use but is also secure. The second is that if a citizens’ initiative is successful, it should be followed by a legal act. My question to the Commission is therefore as follows: How will we decide in future which initiatives will result in a legal act and which simply in a hearing? Perhaps you could explain this, Mr Šefčovič. I would also like to thank you once again for your work and for the work done by the Council. Matthias Groote  (S&amp;D

 I voted in favour of the report on the restriction of the use of certain hazardous substances in electrical and electronic equipment (RoHS), because the extension of the area of application to cover all electronic equipment represents a definite improvement. However, I find the fact that there are so many exceptions problematic. In particular in the area of renewable energies, photovoltaic modules, which consist in part of cadmium telluride compounds, are not covered by this directive. This substance is not only harmful to health, it is also hazardous and therefore really ought to be placed within the scope of the RoHS Directive. The danger that, as a result, photovoltaic installations would have to completely disappear from roofs would not arise. Rather, there are numerous cadmium telluride-free alternatives on the market. I therefore disagree in this regard with the decision of the majority in Parliament and the Council. Matthias Groote  (S&amp;D

Madam President, the democratic participation of employees in business is one of the cornerstones of social policy in the European Union. For a month now, workers at the Atlas plants in Ganderkesee, Delmenhorst and Vechta have been striking day and night for precisely these rights. Workers are fighting to secure a collective wage agreement that will enable good, secure jobs to be preserved. Unfortunately, the management has refused point blank to negotiate with the Industrial Union of Metalworkers and the works council. During the course of the industrial dispute, employees have been extremely intimidated and pressurised by management. I wish to call on the management, specifically Mr Filipov, to open discussions and to return to the negotiating table. Democratic participation cannot be allowed to stop at the factory gates. A hire-and-fire system engenders fear and sows the seeds of social unrest. There should be no place for such systems in Europe, as they are damaging to our democracy. Matthias Groote  (S&amp;D

 I voted against the Gallo report because I cannot support measures that have even remotest chance of resulting in people having their Internet access blocked or in the loss of the neutrality of the Internet. Moreover, the report makes no distinction between commercial and non-commercial file sharing, thereby criminalising private Internet users. Furthermore, the report does not contain a definition of the word ‘piracy’, which could counteract such hasty criminalisation. In contrast, the report makes recourse to demands from the very controversial ACTA agreement and to the call for the acceleration of the negotiations. I cannot support such a report.

Madam President, Commissioner, we have gathered here today at this late hour shortly before midnight to debate the subject of climate change. It is a subject that has moved into the background somewhat. We have had a financial and economic crisis – in fact, we are still in it – but nonetheless, this subject is an important one. That is also why my fellow Members have asked what line the Commission intends to take at the forthcoming ICAO negotiations. As Mr Liese has just outlined, here in Parliament, we have long grappled with reaching a compromise on the inclusion of aviation in the emissions trading system. We have conducted delicate negotiations with the Council. I feel that we also need to make this clear to the outside world – indeed internationally. As far as ICAO is concerned, and as far as reducing CO2
 emissions from aviation is concerned, my feeling is that so far, a lot of time has been invested in this, but with minimal results. We therefore need to defend our proposal on the international stage in the same way as it was defended here in Parliament, where it was adopted with a large majority. The European system will come into effect in 2012 and we have included third countries in it. That means that if an aircraft takes off in Washington and lands in the European Union, then it will fall within the emissions trading system of the European Union. Climate change is a global problem, and consequently, it is a problem that must be tackled globally. If we are serious about doing so, then we need to develop fiscal instruments. We have imposed duties on small vehicles, such as cars and lorries. Unfortunately, we are not in a position to develop uniform tax rates in Europe. I am therefore under no illusions that there is any possibility of developing an international CO2
 tax. Instead, the second best solution is therefore emissions trading, ideally globally, with rules covering third countries. These rules on third countries must also be defended tooth and nail by the European Commission and by the Council, which unfortunately, is not present at this late hour. The US is an international player. The Obama administration initially set its sights high where climate legislation is concerned. To date, however, this has not been followed up by action. The ball is now in the US’s court as regards getting climate legislation under way and harmonising and fine-tuning it internationally. This is very important. The UN climate conference in Copenhagen was a flop, as we all know. It was not crowned with success. I fear that ICAO and Annex 16 of the ICAO Agreement, which regulates environmental measures, will also be a flop. Therefore, my question to the Commission is as follows: if no agreement is reached this time regarding the inclusion of aviation in emissions trading, is the Commission actually prepared to continue negotiating at ICAO level? Is there a Plan B in this event? How will the European Commission and also the Council react in this event? Matthias Groote and Bernhard Rapkay  (S&amp;D

 The German Social Democratic (SPD) delegation in the European Parliament is in favour of combating international terrorism and providing permanent protection for personal data with the highest possible degree of determination and effectiveness. In view of the importance of data protection, the SPD delegation did not make its decision lightly. After long and careful consideration, however, we are now able to vote in favour of the agreement: the Social Democrats have succeeded in providing for the establishment of permanent European monitoring in connection with the extraction of the data directly on the ground in the US Treasury Department – including the facility to stop the extraction of data. For us, the top priority was limiting the transfer of bulk data. SEPA data are not covered by the agreement; most transfers are not affected at all. The five-year data retention period is intended to be reviewed annually, whereby any data that is not needed is to be deleted sooner than this. In addition, an annual review of compliance with all data protection standards, with the involvement of data protection supervisors, is provided for. Even though we would have preferred the monitoring role and the transfer of data to be given to a judicial authority, Europol must carry out its mandate for approving the data transfer, provided for in the agreement, under the strict scrutiny of the EU. Although Europol has a reliable data protection system, it needs to be brought into line with the Treaty of Lisbon so that it can perform its duties under full democratic scrutiny.

 Mr President, it was not possible for me to vote ‘No’ in the vote because the voting machine only displayed something once I had pressed the ‘Yes’ button followed by the ‘Abstention’ button. Please would you check once again how the machine is collecting and counting the votes, because in my opinion, it was not conclusive. I was not the only one who found this; a number of other Members had the same experience. They were unable to press the ‘Abstention’ button or the ‘No’ button, but instead had to vote ‘Yes’ first. It makes this voting process rather hazardous. Please would you therefore check again how the votes were counted. Matthias Groote  (S&amp;D

Madam President, first of all I should like to thank the rapporteur, Mr Méndez de Vigo. I see no need to convene a convention. It is a matter of detail that needs to be clarified. Since 1979, the European Parliament has been elected in a direct and secret ballot and that is the way it should continue to be done in future, too. We and the Council would be well advised to deal with this problem as quickly as possible at an intergovernmental conference, because out of the 18 Members, 16 are in a state of suspense, which is rather intolerable. The ball is therefore back in the Council’s court. I would ask the Council not to give in on this point because one Member State has failed to find clear rules on account of it expecting the Treaty of Lisbon to enter into force sooner. I am pleased that we now have this Treaty in place, but we now have our homework to do. The Méndez de Vigo report is a good basis for strengthening this process. However, the Council would be well advised not to succumb to the temptation to accept Members being sent here from a national parliament. That would set a precedent and I am not happy to accept that. Therefore, the rapporteur has my full support, with the proviso that no Members be sent here from national parliaments. Matthias Groote  (S&amp;D

 Madam President, Commissioner, Mr Carlgren, ladies and gentlemen, the subject of climate change will keep us occupied much longer than the financial and economic crisis. There are parallels – both cost lots of money, and Copenhagen will be about reaching an agreement on the financial tools for the third world and the developing countries. The Copenhagen conference must succeed, and we can play our part in achieving that. Yesterday, we did a good job, we adopted the resolution in the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Food Safety by a large majority, and I think that the resolution will achieve a large majority here in Parliament, and in so doing, we will change the political climate as Copenhagen approaches. There is often a psychological side to it, and we should all play our part in that. I do still have one specific concern. In the European Parliament, we have worked to get aviation included in emissions trading, and in the end we succeeded. I therefore call on the Commission and the Council to ensure that this subject is pursued consistently in Copenhagen. We must achieve international agreement to the effect that shipping, and also aviation, are incorporated into the successor treaty to the Kyoto Protocol. This is because these two transport sectors are growing to a disproportionate degree and are therefore contributing in a disproportionate way to global warming. We should not exceed the 2 degree Celsius mark. That, in fact, is where the parallels between the financial crisis and climate change cease. If we go over this mark, we will have done irreparable damage to our planet and that means that it is damage that we will not be able to reverse. Matthias Groote  (S&amp;D

 Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, I very much liked what the Commissioner described here today with regard to the Desertec project. This project has huge potential and its appeal indeed lies in the fact that it is made up of many separate small projects. This will create jobs and will prepare the way for the environmentally sound industrial policy that we are striving for. I have a question for the Commission. When you were talking about the Desertec project, I had the feeling that the handbrake was on to some extent. What concrete measures are planned with regard to network infrastructure, which is a massive problem in connection with the development of renewable energy? The idea is, of course, to transmit the electricity to Europe via high voltage direct current lines from the deserts. What supporting measures can the European Commission take with regard to this? Is something already being considered in this regard? What can we expect from the next Commission in this area? Matthias Groote  (S&amp;D

 Madam President, Commissioners, ladies and gentlemen, this is, of course, not the first time that we have debated the subject of Opel and the car industry. I am pleased that the rescue succeeded. There were other proposals on the table, such as a structured insolvency. In the supply industry – and I have just come from Bavaria, where I visited a supply company – people are very urgently dependent on orders. Things have got out of control. If Opel, too, had been driven to insolvency, things would have been very, very bad and the consequences would have been devastating. We have just heard the Commission’s conclusions. There was a car industry summit, in which the Commission took part, but we actually heard nothing after the summit. Today we have heard where the problem may lie. what is not possible. That must change in future – we need to hear from the Commission what is possible, so as to forestall nationalistic debates. The Commission needs to mediate more effectively so that we pursue a common European industrial policy. That is also what I hope for from the next Commission. Norbert Glante,

 Mr President, Commissioner, I would like to apologise. The Parliament building’s lifts were very busy. Perhaps the manufacturers should think about including a priority override function. That is why I am a little late. Commissioner, I am much obliged to you for answering these pressing questions. Forgive me if I repeat myself a little, but I simply want to emphasise a point – I believe that the GMES (Global Monitoring for Environment and Security) programme is one of the two leading initiatives in the European Union’s space policy and is of key importance for the monitoring of the Earth. This, in turn, is an indispensable instrument in the fight against climate change, environmental pollution, disaster prevention and security, sustainable development, mobility and crisis management. GMES was established as a Union programme and will receive funding of about EUR 3.2 billion from the budget until 2013. The lack of a workable financial plan for long-term, solid financial support would probably mean that the costs will rise in the long term. The programme and the associated supply of data could be temporarily suspended or even abandoned entirely. In the final analysis, this could mean that the investments previously made will have been in vain. Europe could lose its independence and technological edge in relation to this important space infrastructure. What is at issue? We are talking about a sum of EUR 5.8 billion for the period 2014 to 2020, admittedly a very large amount of money, but one that offers a very substantial economic benefit. Despite the current budgetary difficulties in many Member States, GMES must be sufficiently financed in the budget and through the financial perspective. Mr Barnier, you wrote us a letter recently. If I might quote you: ‘Europe should not be satisfied with defensive answers to the crisis – however important this may be – Europe must also open up the prospect of new growth for its citizens!’ This idea could be expressed very succinctly. It is possible to drive oneself to destruction through excessive savings. This principle applies in a different context to an important Member State of the European Union. If GMES is to be run on an intergovernmental basis in future outside the budget, so that Parliament would no longer have a say in the project, then, in my opinion, the European space strategy would be doomed before it even began. This is why we are calling for a legislative proposal from the Commission for the long-term administration, financing and implementation of GMES and the embedding of the budget in medium-term financial planning. The Danish Presidency announced conclusions for the Competitiveness Council on 21 February and then cancelled them again because there was no majority in the Council. Some Member States question whether the Council Working Party on Space should be responsible for this project, which I find particularly surprising. Unfortunately, this development in the Council has given rise to two camps. One camp, a group of Member States that fund GMES through the budget, has also written to you. A second group wants to follow the proposal tabled by the Commission. If this stalemate continues, I fear that GMES may fail and that an enormous opportunity will have been lost. This is quite apart from the fact that many millions of euro already spent on the project will have been spent for nothing. The greatest risk, however, is that we will set a precedent, and that the Member States will use this to justify activities outside of the Treaty of Lisbon. I thought we had put these times behind us. I have three demands. Firstly, I hope that we, the European Parliament, will be courageous enough to continue to finance the major projects of the EU, such as GMES, but also Galileo and ITER, through the budget and to establish separate budget lines with sufficient reserves for this purpose. Secondly, I hope and demand that the Commission tables this legislative proposal as soon as possible. Thirdly, I call on the Council to push through reasonable and sufficient funding within the budget and to take the necessary decision. Norbert Glante,  
rapporteur.

 Mr President, I want to keep this brief. I know Members are not always pleased when the rapporteur speaks again before the vote. I simply wanted to thank all those involved and, in this context, I hope that this signal can soon be put to use so that there are enough satellites in orbit, and that the Member States come up with sufficient money for the future budget and the financial perspective so that the Galileo navigation satellite system is actually put into operation. Many thanks once again; I hope we have a bright future ahead of us. Norbert Neuser  (S&amp;D

 Mr President, Baroness Ashton, you spoke about how important it is to bring about peace in the Middle East. You said that the Middle East Quartet is playing a positive role and that the EU should support Jordan and the Quartet. The Israeli Government claims that it is in favour of a responsible peace process and a two-state solution, but the reality looks rather different. The Gaza Strip is still an open-air prison. The EU and the United Nations are constantly providing more money to feed the people in Gaza and the Israeli army has destroyed aid projects set up by the EU in occupied Palestinian territory in recent years which cost EUR 50 million. The aim of these aid projects was to provide better living conditions for the Palestinians and they included schools, infrastructure and education projects. We owe it to our taxpayers in the EU to make it clear to the Israelis that this situation has to change and that Israel’s settlement policy must finally come to an end. Norbert Neuser,  
rapporteur.

 Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, the beginning of 2012 is a timely occasion for the report on universal energy access, as the United Nations General Assembly has designated 2012 as the International Year of Sustainable Energy for All. To me and to all my fellow Members who worked with me on this report in committee, two facts are particularly important. The first is that we want renewable energy. The second is that we want everyone to have access to these new sources of energy. Consequently, these sources of energy must be affordable by everyone. In the Committee on Development, we worked together very constructively, including with NGOs. In this connection, particular mention must be made of the London-based organisation, Practical Action, and of Sweden’s Stockholm Environment Institute. Our secretariat also provided us with vigorous support in finding ways in which we can forge ahead with universal access to renewable energy. Allow me to clarify once more what we are talking about here. At present, 1.3 billion people live without electricity. A total of 2.7 billion people use biomass to cook, on improvised stoves. The vast majority of these live in rural areas, mainly in sub-Saharan Africa and India. To give just one example: 20% of the population of Kenya has access to the grid, but only 5% of the rural population. Access to energy brings not only light and power, but also – and above all – cooking facilities and heating. Yet access to energy is still not a Millennium Development Goal. Without access to it, however, it will be difficult to achieve our Millennium Development Goals. That is why we call in the report for renewable energy to be included in the post-2015 MDGs. It is hard to see how schools, training facilities, health centres and hospitals could exist or function without electricity. Cooking and heating with biomass causes millions of deaths each year in shacks, as a result of harmful smoke. Many of Africa’s governments have therefore banned the use of coal for cooking and heating, for climate and health reasons. In practice, however, those responsible have to look the other way when coal is produced and sold. We very much welcome the fact that, in its Agenda for Change, the Commission has included energy as a guiding priority. Allow me, therefore, to summarise our key demands in the report once more. We call on the EU and the Member States to support the UN goals of universal access to energy by 2030 and to align their policies accordingly. We call on the Commission to focus on small, local renewable energy projects, because only then will it be possible to reach the majority of the population. More money should be made available for this. The European Investment Bank and the other European development banks are not geared towards small, local energy projects. That has to change; universal energy access should be prominently represented in the Rio+20 process. Finally, universal energy access should be included as a Millennium Development Goal post-2015.

 Madam President, Baroness Ashton, the European Union is involved in a number of missions in Afghanistan on the basis of United Nations resolutions. Too many young soldiers from Europe have lost their lives in Afghanistan. A large number have been seriously injured or are suffering from the mental stress caused by military service. Thousands of civilian aid workers from Europe risk their lives every day to help to bring about a better future in Afghanistan. All of them and all of us have a right to know how Europe’s commitment in Afghanistan can be bought to successful and lasting conclusion and how long we will continue to have a military presence in the country. What needs to be changed or improved and what are the objectives of the new EU strategy for Afghanistan? We need to make greater efforts in the area of civil reconstruction. We must at last make progress with retraining the Afghan police force and judiciary. We know that there will not be a military solution and, therefore, we must increase our efforts to bring about a political solution to the conflict, by means of the EU and a common foreign policy. We must show determination and push forward with the internal reconciliation process in Afghanistan and include moderate members of the Taliban. We need to put in place specific initiatives, in particular at a regional level, to stabilise the situation. This involves, in particular, effective means of combating drug cultivation and trafficking. Our strategy includes good proposals. We call on the Afghan Government to demonstrate that it has the will to introduce a better system of governance which is free from corruption. However, the new EU strategy can only be successful if it no longer plays a passive role, but actively involves the neighbouring countries. Baroness Ashton, we are putting our hopes on you, we are relying on you and you have our full support. Norbert Neuser  (S&amp;D

 Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, the signs look very promising for the EU-Africa summit. The summit will revolve entirely around an equal partnership for a better common future. Two months after the Millennium Development Goals summit in New York, we have the unique opportunity to take further specific, binding steps in the fight against poverty in Africa. We are, of course, following all of China’s extensive activities on the African continent to safeguard its own supply of raw materials with great concern. It is very much reminiscent of the behaviour of colonial states. The European Union must, therefore, press for a regulation that promotes the common good of, and social progress in, the African countries. That will create work that is sustainable. I therefore expressly welcome the Commission’s proposal to employ effective controls in the context of raw materials management. Together with the African partners, we need to support a structural policy that promotes growth and climate protection in order for the African people to escape from the poverty trap. We support the Commission’s proposals for social cohesion, because they will help to create jobs. We must put the people of Africa in a position where they can achieve the goal of earning a living wage through their own work. Finally, I would like to provide a summary of the following priorities. Firstly, we need to strengthen the African Union and its representations in all international bodies – the Security Council, G20 and the Pan-African Parliament. The Millennium Goals must be achieved in Africa by 2015 by means of further initiatives. We must ensure that the social standards stipulated by the International Labour Organisation (ILO) are laid down and made binding in any economic and trade agreements between the EU and Africa. Norbert Neuser  (S&amp;D

 Madam President, Commissioner, I welcome the clear words chosen by Mr Piebalgs. It is important for the European Parliament to show clearly where it stands and also to condemn the brutality that has taken place there. It has taken us a long time to hold the debate on Western Sahara in the European Parliament, and I think that we have been too hesitant in our actions and that we act only after there have been fatalities there. I am pleased that we will be able to adopt a resolution tomorrow with all parties, which will perhaps not go as far as one or other of the groups would like, but it represents a broad consensus and is a clear signal to Morocco and to the population of Western Sahara that the European Parliament stands by its fundamental values. As chair of the Intergroup, I would like to offer my sincere thanks to all of its members, who have ensured that Western Sahara has remained, and will continue to remain, on the agenda. I am certain that, together with Mr Piebalgs and Baroness Ashton, we must remain committed to Western Sahara. Norbert Neuser  (S&amp;D

 Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, achievement of the Millennium Development Goals by 2015 is crucially dependent on how much money the rich industrialised nations make available for combating hunger and poverty, reducing child and maternal mortality and combating malaria and AIDS. Our conclusion is sobering. Our promises will not be met. Prior to the financial crisis, we in Europe, as rich industrialised nations, had promised the poorest countries USD 50 billion for this year, 2010. It will be significantly less than that: around USD 36 billion. Even the agreed twelve-point action plan, according to which the wealthy countries want to give 0.7% of their gross national income in development aid, will not be fulfilled. Some countries are setting a good example, but my country, Germany, does not look good. We ought to follow the example of other countries like Sweden, Luxembourg, Belgium, Ireland, the United Kingdom and even Spain. Peter Simon,  
deputising for the rapporteur Mojca Kleva Kekuš

 Mr[nbsp ]President, our colleague, Mojca Kleva Kekuš, who is the co-rapporteur on this file, became a mother two months ago so she cannot be here with us today. I wish her and her little daughter all the best. She did a lot of good work on this dossier, so allow me now to present her words and ideas. A year ago, with the change in international standards, Parliament received a package of Commission proposals for updating and improving European legislation on combating money laundering more effectively. At a time when technology and the means available to criminals are constantly evolving, it is crucial that our legislation should keep pace with the changing realities. We now have before us an updated regulation, which will enhance the transparency of fund transfers of all types: domestic and cross-border. The regulation lays down rules for our banks and other payment-service providers regarding information on payers and payees which they need to collect and transfer throughout the entire payment chain. This update will make it easier for law enforcement authorities to track funds transferred by criminals and terrorists. The new rules will help to identify not only the payers but also the receivers of laundered money. The new regulation focuses more closely on the effectiveness of regimes to counter money laundering and terrorist financing, and on ensuring greater clarity and consistency of rules across the Member States. It is also broader in scope, with a view to addressing new threats. The rapporteur, Ms[nbsp ]Kleva Kekuš, is also pleased that, thanks to Parliament’s involvement, the regulation is now more effective in ensuring compliance with European data-protection requirements, guaranteeing that all the safeguards protecting individual rights in relation to personal data will actually be applied. What remains crucial in making the fight against money laundering effective, however, is the work on enforcement and implementation of the new rules. To combat this problem effectively we need two things at the same time: a coordinated response from law enforcement bodies in the Member States and a standard procedure for financial institutions and payment-service providers. The new rules now centre on a risk-based approach, which should strengthen the capabilities and roles of payment-service providers in identifying transfers that smell fishy. To conclude, the danger of money laundering is also closely linked with the problems of tax evasion and tax havens. This Parliament has, on numerous occasions, called for concrete and effective action to eliminate the scandalous tax gap. The improvement of these rules on fund transfers will serve as one small piece of the puzzle. The rapporteur, Ms[nbsp ]Kleva Kekuš, believes that, thanks to good cooperation and hard work on the part of the other co-rapporteur and all the shadows, the text in front of us is something that Parliament can be proud of. She thanks everyone for their contribution. Peter Simon  (S&amp;D

Mr President, Mr Louca, you have emphasised the importance of this House in relation to the continued development of economic and monetary union. I therefore allow myself to refer to paragraph 8 of the report that we are adopting today. With this paragraph this House calls on the Council to finally bring to a conclusion the legislative procedures relating to the realisation of economic and monetary union that are being blocked by the Council. Nine months ago this House adopted a key part of the banking union legislation, that relating to deposit guarantees, at first reading. Since then it has been up to the Council to respond and find a common position. For nine months the Council has been sleeping on this. For nine months the Council has been inactive, and you, Mr Louca, as the President-in-Office of the Council, have taken no action – absolutely no action at all – in relation to the European Parliament in four and a half months to move this legislative procedure forward! We have promised European taxpayers that future crises will not be paid for by them, but by the banks themselves. If we now endeavour to implement supervision quickly, we will be making use of the European Stability Mechanism. Also taxpayers’ money! A reliable deposit guarantee scheme, a reliable fund for the recovery and resolution of banks – these are funds that relieve the burden on taxpayers. Devote yourself to these funds with the same zeal! Make exactly the same progress with them! You will be judged on this by European taxpayers, but also by this House. Peter Simon  (S&amp;D
). 
 – (DE) 
Mr President, Commissioner, I extend warm thanks for your cooperation on one of the important elements in the banking union project, deposit guarantee schemes. You have quite rightly pointed out that the four pillars alongside supervision are of equal importance. Deposit guarantee schemes and crisis funds are two of these four pillars. This morning, Commission President Barroso stated that we could not have a situation where, in future, citizens would still have to pick up the tab for the mistakes of the banks. As you know, you have significant support in this House for the best possible financing of deposit guarantee schemes and crisis management. However, you know as well as I do that our common opponent is sitting in the Council. You know as well as I do that the deposit guarantee scheme that we adopted with a large, cross-party majority seven months ago with a worthwhile level of funding that would bring stability to the area has been given the green light by this House and sent forward for implementation. For the last seven months, the governments of the Member States have done nothing to meet us half way, nothing to ensure the future stability of the systems. I would like to ask at this juncture how you think we can rescue this situation. One thing is clear: Parliament will not allow plans to be drawn up for chronically underfunded guarantee schemes that are not worthy of the name. How can we work together to persuade the Council to keep its promises, so that our citizens are no longer asked to provide backing for banks that should be wound up or to pay out on deposits, but that the banks themselves should provide their own protections in future by contributing to corresponding funds? Peter Simon,  
rapporteur.
 – (DE)
 Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, tomorrow we are to vote on the new regulation on the deposit guarantee scheme at first reading. This is remarkable on several counts. Firstly, on a procedural level, because, as part of the new regulation of the financial markets, we have thus far managed to reach an agreement between the Council and Parliament at first reading, where both sides at least had a solution that they agreed they could live with. That is not the case here. Agreement between the Council and Parliament has proved impossible. The other remarkable thing is that this proved impossible at a point where the new financial market regulations are most tangible to the people of Europe, because it is their fate at stake, their savings books and their current accounts – in other words, their money. The European Commission made a proposal that initially seemed a little too inflexible in Parliament’s view when it came to the way in which guarantee schemes were to be organised. As rapporteur, I am very pleased that, thanks to the excellent support, cooperation and constant dialogue with the shadow rapporteurs, I have finally succeeded in producing a draft that takes account of this. This means that in future, the principles promised by politicians in all Member States to their people will be embraced in Europe and that, in the event of future bank crises and bank failures, the taxpayer will not be required to pick up the tab, but rather the banks will have saved the necessary resources in a fund during the good times, or at least the less bad times, to enable them to pay depositors, current account holders and savers in the event of a crisis involving the collapse of a bank. In addition to suggesting such a stable fund, we also came up with a solution for the periods within which ordinary citizens should get their money back. I think that the period of one week that we suggest is within a timeframe where people will still manage to get by and will be able to go about their daily business without needing additional cash. We did not think that longer periods without access to finances would be reasonable. We continue to believe that we need to ensure that the different risk profiles of the banks in Europe should be taken into account when payments are made into a guarantee fund. Riskier banks should be required to pay in more than banks that have a lower risk because of their business models. All of these principles were brought together into an overall draft here in Parliament, finding broad majority support in the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs, in a broad coalition of parties, from the Left, through the Socialists, the Greens and the Liberals to the Conservatives. When we came to negotiate with the Member States, this made it all the more difficult for us to understand why they were unwilling to provide the necessary resources for a guarantee fund, to be provided by the banks in order to establish sufficient stability, why it proved impossible to achieve a faster payout for depositors, and why a consumer-friendly solution could not be found, even after eight months of negotiations. We therefore agreed, by means of a first reading, to give a clear signal in favour of consumer protection in Europe. We are prepared to go to a swift second reading with the Council. We wish to thank the Commission for its efforts in brokering a deal. However, we believe that tomorrow, we will have to show the European public what we think is appropriate in relation to depositor protection in Europe. Peter Simon,  
rapporteur.

 Mr President, Commissioner, I can only return these expressions of thanks in equal measure. Like you, I am convinced that there is a positive prospect of success in the coming weeks and months under the Danish Presidency, provided all those involved, by which I mean quite explicitly the Council, enter into constructive negotiations. Constructive negotiations also mean being willing actually to provide certain minimum standards in these guarantee schemes, as emphasised verbally on frequent occasions to the public. Then I believe that we will have no problem and that we will start to see light at the end of the tunnel. I would like to thank the rapporteurs and the shadow rapporteurs for their kind words and for their support to date. I believe that we will also be able to continue working together in this positive vein in the coming months and would like to add my voice to that of Mr Barnier in relation to what we have heard from Ms Ford and Ms Swinburne. I think I could not have put it better myself at this point. I would therefore like to limit my answer to a single point, namely, to the comment made by Mr Stoyanov in relation to the question of a four week payout period versus a seven day payout period. None of us want to make promises that we cannot keep. We therefore need to make it clear that the schemes can pay out within the promised deadlines. National legislation requires British banks to take all the necessary steps to facilitate this. They have already been able to do that. If British banks can do this in seven days, then I believe banks in your country, and mine too, will be able to do the same. We will allow them sufficient time to be able to make money available as quickly as possible in the interests of the public. I believe that this is a point that we will need to discuss further in our forthcoming negotiations with the Council. I would again like to thank all my colleagues and hope that we shall produce a result under the Danish Presidency. Peter Simon,  
rapporteur.

 Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, public services are a fundamental pillar of our European social model and not only play a key role for the individual citizen, but are also of enormous importance for the wellbeing of society at large. For this reason, the following question should be uppermost in our minds when we come to reform the EU State aid rules on services of general economic interest. What conditions are needed to ensure the highest possible service quality and, on the other hand, to guarantee universal access for all levels within the population? The key to the provision and organisation of such high-quality public services is certainty among service providers and public authorities in relation to the general legal conditions, on the one hand, and greater proportionality in the regulations, on the other, so that more attention is paid to the diversity of the various kinds of public service and so that administrative effort is reduced. Thus, the EU State aid rules can only be reformed if the special function of public services is taken into account and if the subsidiarity principle is strictly observed. In addition, a legal framework for public services should be established for a sufficient degree of legal certainty. For us in the Group of the Progressive Alliance of Socialists and Democrats in the European Parliament, the legal basis for this would be Article 14 of the Treaty of Lisbon. However, as we know, opinion in the European Parliament has been divided on this issue for many years. Nonetheless, we believe that this report has succeeded in its objective of finding a compromise that could be accepted by almost all sides. The administrative effort involved in managing compensatory payments to those providing public services is currently too high. This is particularly true for small authorities and service providers. The increase we have called for in the thresholds for exemption from mandatory notification of the European Commission when claiming compensatory payments would provide initial relief. The State aid rules must be designed so that the administrative effort expended by the local authorities and service providers is proportionate to the potential impact on the internal European market and on competition. The special de minimis
 arrangements we propose provide an important basis for this, involving a general exception to the regulations for purely local services and social services. To ensure that we cater more precisely to the special role of social services, we would call for a clear definition and protection of their function and character. In addition, our report also clearly rejects the proposal from the European Commission that efficiency criteria should be introduced for services of general interest as a prerequisite for establishing their compatibility with EU competition rules. The European Commission is going beyond its remit here, as it is simply responsible for controlling State aid. On the other hand, the definition of economic conditions is solely a matter for the Member States and can only be regulated on a European level with the cooperation of the European Parliament. In this context, I would like to close by thanking my colleagues, the shadow rapporteurs, for excellent cross-party cooperation in the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs. The clear vote in favour of my report at committee level is evidence of this results-based, solutions-oriented cooperation. I am therefore confident that in tomorrow’s plenary vote, we shall also succeed in sending out a clear signal from the European Parliament to the European Commission demanding sustainable, future-proofed general conditions in the area of public services.

 Madam President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, right across Europe, our cities and communities have to struggle with problem districts. Right across Europe, we try to solve this problem by bringing these disadvantaged areas and the people living in them up to the level of normal life in the rest of our towns and cities. If, however, we now lay down criteria in the field of social housing, as the Commission is doing here, if we lay down criteria that explicitly – as some Members have already said – preclude a mixing of the population in these areas, that will undermine all the efforts made by the competent parties on the ground for decades. It will also undermine ventures that the European Union has promoted with its Community initiatives Urban and Urban II. If, here, we restrict the criteria according to which social housing can be subsidised in such a way that actually only the poorest of the poor, the most disadvantaged of the disadvantaged, receive a subsidy and can be helped within the framework of social housing, we will actually be putting up obstacles to this segment of the population mixing in disadvantaged districts, something that is, in fact, urgently needed. This will lead to more social exclusion of precisely these population groups and will only increase these problems in our cities. With that in mind, a broad definition and broad interpretation of the principle of subsidiarity are the order of the day, and I would be grateful to the Commission if it could briefly express a position in this regard. Petra Kammerevert,  
on behalf of the S&amp;D Group.

 Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, I, too, would like to offer my sincere thanks to Ms Geringer de Oedenberg for the results of her negotiations with the Council. I know that it was difficult to also get the numerous good ideas that we had in Parliament through the tough negotiations with the Council. Certainly, with the directive, we have now found a viable route to granting works of literature orphan work status and preserving this cultural heritage for the future while making it accessible. However, I do still have some minor doubts about whether we have really found an efficient solution for audiovisual works. Across the EU, a cultural asset has accumulated in the archives, especially of broadcasters after 1945, that is of inestimable value. Preserving this cultural heritage for the future, too, poses an enormous challenge on both a technical and financial level. The number of rights holders for audiovisual works is frequently higher than for written works. The diligent search that, under the directive, will also be necessary for audiovisual works takes a form that is therefore intensive in terms of costs, time and personnel. There is a great cultural policy interest in preserving our audiovisual heritage, especially in this Internet age. We now need to carefully observe whether we have succeeded, through this directive, in noticeably reducing the number of audiovisual works in the European Union that are unusable in practical situations due to the rights being unclear. The review clause offers us a good opportunity here. In any case, we need to prevent audiovisual material in the archives going to waste as unrecoverable because it proves too costly to clear up who holds the rights. It goes without saying that, for orphan works, too, rights holders must be given reasonable remuneration. The involvement of collecting societies and other rights declaration systems here could help to remove uncertainties about rights, allow originators to come into their own, and thus also to release cultural treasures. I would have liked to have seen a little greater progress at this juncture, but the first step has been taken, and I believe we will work on this further over the forthcoming years. Petra Kammerevert  (S&amp;D

 Mr President, we must get rid of ACTA and I am pleased that the debate here in Parliament is moving in precisely this direction. ACTA is an attack on fundamental rights, such as the protection of privacy, freedom of information and communication and the right to informational self-determination. It is the whole host of vague legal terms which have opened the door to this. We are faced with the threat that legal protection and legal procedures will no longer be available. We are right to be concerned that providers will be forced to monitor the Internet, put web blocks in place and filter content. Ultimately, this could lead to law enforcement being privatised and the providers being turned into deputy sheriffs. The protection of individuals’ copyright must not, under any circumstances, lead to the freedom of information and communication being undermined. It is true that we need a modern copyright law which has a sensible balance between the interests of the originators and of the users. I would like the Commission finally to submit a proposal for this. ACTA will not help in this respect at all. Instead, it is forcing us to move in a very specific direction. This is why we must say ‘No’ to ACTA tomorrow. Petra Kammerevert  (S&amp;D

Madam President, I would like to bring a little reality to the illusion that has just been so elegantly produced because, from a culture and media policy point of view, the Council’s Common Position is, in fact, a disappointment and unsatisfactory. Frequencies are a scarce public good with considerable cultural and media policy significance. As long as, for example, radio needs frequencies to broadcast its services, these are of particular importance for the freedom of the media and of expression in Europe. The Committee on Culture and Education has put forward a series of proposals for how this can reasonably be taken into consideration. Alongside clear wordings on the special role of radio and the consideration that it needs to be given, we warned that we need to open the door now to the second digital dividend. We called for clear compensation rules so that it is clarified that switchover-related costs, for example for the new procurement of technology in theatres, will be assumed and that provision must be made for compensation for investments that made the digital dividend possible. There is nothing left of all this, apart from the brief reference to the Telecoms Package and a few permissive provisions for the Member States. I now expect the Commission and the Member States to at least demonstrate in their practical actions that they are aware of their responsibilities, that their dealings with this public good will not be solely in pursuit of economic benefit and that they are aware of its importance for media diversity and for the cultural interests of our society. Petra Kammerevert  (S&amp;D
). 
 – (DE)
 Mr President, an open Internet and the guarantee of non-discriminatory access for everyone are essential prerequisites for the freedom of communication, the freedom of information, media pluralism and diversity of opinion. We are therefore sending an important and appropriate signal to the Commission and also to the Member States that we want the ‘best effort’ principle as well as fundamental transparency regulations to be laid down. However, I would have liked us to call on the Commission today to clearly define net neutrality and to enshrine it in law. If we wait any longer, we run the risk that network operators will create a version of reality that will be very difficult to put right later on. I would also have liked to have seen a very clear ban on the control of the content of data packets. I would have liked the back door that this resolution leaves open to be closed today, and from the discussion, I sense that many fellow Members agree with me here. I believe that we should continue to work on this. Petra Kammerevert,  
rapporteur for the opinion of the Committee on Culture and Education

 Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, sexual abuse and sexual violence against children and young people as well as images of this are indeed among the worst possible crimes that anyone could commit against young people. Our highest priority must be to protect the victims, to prosecute the perpetrators and to punish them in a procedure that follows the rule of law. It is therefore good that, together, we have found a way to tackle this crime throughout the EU and to obtain a common basis for this. In the Committee on Culture and Education, in addition to the issues of prevention, effective prosecution, information and more instruction in the use of media, one principle was particularly important to us and that was the principle of ‘deletion rather than blocking’. I am therefore pleased that, after a long struggle, we have succeeded in stipulating the deletion of websites depicting sexual violence against children and young people. The Commission proposed making it mandatory for all Member State to block these websites. However, it is no help to any child at all simply to draw a curtain, so to speak. Internet blocks are ineffective, imprecise, easy to circumvent and do not help to combat sexual abuse. In contrast, they create a censorship infrastructure, an instrument for controlling communication streams and are thus a threat to fundamental rights. In Germany, this has now been implemented. I very much hope that this example will also be followed in other Member States and that they will not use the option of blocking, as stated in the directive. Petra Kammerevert,  
rapporteur for the opinion of the Committee on Culture and Education.

 Madam President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, political initiatives for developing fast Internet connections across the board are, in principle, to be welcomed. However, the spectrum is a scarce resource and, above all, it is a public good. It was therefore a particular concern of the Committee on Culture and Education that it be made clear that the spectrum is, and remains, essential for the fulfilment of a wide range of societal, cultural and social functions. For this reason, it was particularly important to us that the requirements of the telecoms package for safeguarding media pluralism and cultural diversity were not thrown out by the back door. Both public and private broadcasting are essential guarantors of media pluralism and diversity of opinion in Europe. We must ensure that they can continue to fulfil their vital functions unimpeded in future, too. The Committee on Culture and Education had therefore proposed that the 790 band not be opened in the first instance, but unfortunately, the Committee on Industry, Research and Energy did not follow our suggestion. Although it is mentioned in several places that the interests of broadcasting are to be taken into consideration, the Committee on Culture and Education would have liked there to have been much clearer wording in this regard. It was particularly important to us that, before spectrum allocation, clear regulations be laid down to prevent theatres and anyone using wireless microphones, for example, from being saddled with the cost of paying for a frequency change or for new technology. We are all called on to continue to ensure a fair balance of interests for all parties concerned. I hope that we will succeed in doing so in future, too. Petra Kammerevert  (S&amp;D

 Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, first of all, I would once again like to offer my sincere thanks to Mrs Trüpel for the truly excellent report that we are debating today. I believe that it is a splendid project that will be making Europe’s diverse cultural heritage available to the people of Europe and throughout the world in a digital online library. However, it still requires further joint efforts on our part to actually make this project a success. A significant prerequisite for this is, in the view of my group, the free – and that means also, as far as possible, cost-free – access to our cultural heritage via Europeana. In the joint discussions, we have reached a good compromise, which protects the interests of authors of protected works on the one hand while, at the same time, providing the necessary free accessibility, and I would very much like the Commission to also take account of and adopt these proposals in future. Another prerequisite is that the Member States become increasingly aware of their responsibility. For my own country, this means that it is not acceptable for Goethe to be available in Polish and French, but not in the original German. In this regard, we must all jointly call on the Member States more strongly to once again provide the appropriate financial resources to make Europeana a real success on this level as well. Udo Bullmann  (S&amp;D

Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, with or without a summit, Europe is still in recession. There is a lack of growth stimulus and a shortage of jobs. Mr Barroso and Mr Van Rompuy, you will have to launch some fresh initiatives before your term in office comes to end, otherwise there will be no end to this crisis in Europe. A summit, no matter how intensive the debate, cannot change anything. Europe’s young people have no jobs.  Mr Barroso, you have instruments at your disposal. Mr Andor and the Commission could utilise the available instruments. Why are we not making cuts within the framework that we already have, within the framework of the commitments made in the European Semester, tying the Member States into this process and starting straight away? Why are we not focusing on the young unemployed based on a specific annual percentage proposed by the Commission? Why can we do all kinds of things on a binding basis but we apparently cannot combat youth unemployment this way? The European Parliament is waiting for you to take the initiative.  We need more economic policy competences at the European level, that is absolutely right. The basic question is this: who is doing the regulating here, and what are they regulating? Every time the German Finance Minister, Mr Schäuble, comes and talks to us, he says that he would like to have a strong Finance Commissioner. We say, fine, let us give the job to Mr Rehn. That is the Mr Rehn who is possibly listening now to what this House has to say. Mr Rehn, it would be wonderful if you were given more competencies. However, let us make a deal, and let us be quite clear about it: you would then negotiate your mandate with the European Parliament. Life would be very different then. You would not have to ring round all of the European capitals to find out what they wanted at that particular moment. You would not have to negotiate any bilateral agreements with people who have no idea what it is all about. No, you hammer out your mandate with this House. Europe has all the means at its disposal and all the techniques it needs. We should be strengthening the European Union in its present form. We do not need another Europe. We do not need any new institutions. We need to strengthen the existing institutions, and that means strengthening the European Parliament. That is the only way to move out of the crisis. Udo Bullmann  (S&amp;D
). 
 – (DE)
 Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, indeed, the summit has turned around the debate. However, Mr Van Rompuy, the Member States have not yet dared to make the leap. Indeed, it is a major breakthrough to say that we want to make the European Stability Mechanism more active. That is only right and proper. If we do not, we will not really be able to halt the crisis. However, it is also entirely clear to me why the first Member States are already backing off again, why the first heroes of their troops are already disappearing back into the bushes. Why? It is because they forgot to clarify how the stability mechanism would be financed so as to be able to afford this. That takes us to the problem at the heart of this debate. Europe faces a challenge. We will only overcome the crisis if we are able to make a great qualitative leap: more Europe, better ways of working and more joint action. However, we cannot make a run-up to this great leap while at the same time slamming on the brakes. That is what is constantly demonstrated by Member States. I can also say, as regards the second topic, that it is right to say that we want to create a programme for growth. The growth programme is essential. You have opportunities to do so, Mr Van Rompuy, as does Mr Barroso. Simply show us the figures, however, for how much this growth programme can generate. Will it be 0.1%, 0.2%, 0.6% of gross national income? What will it cost to implement the rules of the fiscal pact, which are still too rigid? Perhaps 1%, 1.5%? What is the bill? We need to do more in this direction if it is to work. Udo Bullmann  (S&amp;D
). 
 – (DE)
 Mr President, I have one question for the Council and the Commission. I would like to say to the representatives of the Council Presidency: you know very well that the level of public investment in countries like Germany is currently zero. The situation is not much better elsewhere. This means that public property in Europe is falling into disrepair. Wherever the troika is not forcing states to sell this property below its real value, it is becoming dilapidated. What is your response to this? I have not heard you say anything. In the past, Mr Monti’s name was on everyone’s lips and he was frequently quoted when he talked about the internal market. Today, Mr Monti is saying how important it is for us to invest in our national economies and none of you have mentioned his name. Neither the Council nor the Commission have made any comment on his proposals. I would very much like to know why. I believe that there is a reason why we are not making progress. Your explanations that, on the one hand, we need to save and, on the other, that we must stimulate growth are all correct. Unfortunately, however, they do not explain why something is happening. Instead, they explain why nothing is happening. There is a reason why this is the case, which is that the people who have the upper hand in the Commission and in the Council believe that the best way of climbing a mountain is to put on the brakes on the way up. This runs counter to the laws of physics, just as your economic proposals run counter to the laws of mathematics. I expect you to make changes, because if you do not take up a clear position, you will not help Europe to make progress. Udo Bullmann  (S&amp;D
). 
 – (DE)
 Mr President, Commissioners, ladies and gentlemen, sometimes, I ask myself what you actually take away from these debates with us after sitting here so patiently. Mr Barroso has gone, so it is too late to ask him. The Council is not here either, so the question is superfluous. However, as you are responsible for various areas of the Commission, I can ask you: what will you actually take away from this debate with the European Parliament on an unbelievably serious issue – one that will decide the fate of our populations in the Member States? I will tell you what I am taking away from it: I have a problem. Whenever your services give you reports of how we are not making any progress because growth continues to be in decline, of how employment is in the doldrums, then you get someone to write something about employment and how it can be increased through relatively non-binding measures. I have read it all a hundred times before. Over the past twelve years, I must have read what is written here a hundred times. However, those who commit this stuff to paper are sitting in your departments, Commissioner Rehn. What they actually believe is something different. They believe that we need to chase the countries of southern Europe through a structural recession. Those are the hard facts of the Stability and Growth Pact, those are the hard facts of the fiscal pact, and those are the hard facts of the erroneous expenditure policy. Until you resolve this contradiction and actually commit to paper some concrete measures for raising levels of investment again, the people will not understand you. I do not understand you either. (The speaker agreed to take a blue-card question under Rule 149(8)) Udo Bullmann  (S&amp;D

Blue-card answer.
 – (DE)
 Mr President, firstly, I would like to say to the questioner that the countries she mentions only have no problems on the surface. If you actually read the data on the Netherlands, you will see that growth is in decline there too. When Germans read the statistics, they actually know very well that they are very dependent on them. Things may appear to be going better again in the south, but this is only fleeting. On no account should we think that Germany can maintain its export rates in the long term without a functioning euro area. So my answer is yes; we need to arrive at a constellation in which demand in southern Europe is also boosted again. We need to create new jobs and sensible investment projects, and we need to use all the means at our disposal to ensure that we are not organising a recession that lasts 10 or 20 years. Udo Bullmann  (S&amp;D
). 
 – (DE)
 Mr President, the Council Presidency has told us that on 15 May, it will work towards a European mandate allowing the Commission to negotiate. I think that is a good thing. Rightly so. We will then be able to see how far the European Commission gets in its negotiations with Switzerland and others. It is also right, however, when honourable Members say that we should go for enhanced cooperation in areas where they can help us further. Yet you should ask sometime – you do, after all, have an audience for what you are doing – you should ask the German Government and the French Government why they have not been doing that for a long time already. Why is it that in their home countries, they always come out with fine words, but never actually take the initiative. That would be something. Please would you also publicly answer the question as to why the US is apparently far more successful in its bilateral efforts and is able to exert pressure far more successfully – on Switzerland, for example – than the German Government, rather than simply saying that what they are doing is fine. In the interests of our citizens, ask what the US is doing differently to European countries, so that we can make some practical progress at last. Udo Bullmann  (S&amp;D

 Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, this is the reality of economic development. The Italian economy began to grow at the beginning of the year and in Spain, the signs of growth are even clearer. The situation in Portugal is no better. There are even problems in the Netherlands and industrial order books are shrinking in Germany. Mr Barroso said before he left that we had had a useful discussion this morning. I am currently trying to work out what he meant by that. Mr Barroso and Mr Van Rompuy said ‘growth and employment’ around 10 to 15 times this morning, it is true. Has that changed anything or will it change anything? No! Repeating empty phrases will not result in any changes taking place. Therefore, I would like to know what is new about the way in which the European Council, the Member States and the Commission are dealing with the problem. Mr Barroso gave us one hint when he said that structural reforms must also involve social cohesion. It would be good if you could explain what you mean by that, because we have been arguing about it for quite some time. What do you mean by this? Do you agree with the idea proposed by Mr Swoboda and the Group of the Progressive Alliance of Socialists and Democrats in the European Parliament that all young people must have prospects for the future, but it is just a question of how we ensure this is the case? Do you want minimum wages in all European Member States which adapt dynamically to productivity and growth? Is that what you want? Then you say that growth is essential. Until now, your services have always denied that this had anything to do with investment, because you said that this only concerned structural reforms. This is why the memorandum of understanding in each individual case relating to this issue is so modest. Where is the investment channel that we argued about during the discussions on the ‘six-pack’? If you have nothing to say about investments, then you also have nothing to say about growth. The time for empty phrases has passed. We are waiting for an answer. (Applause) Udo Bullmann  (S&amp;D

 The Members of the European Parliament who belong to the Social Democratic Party of Germany (SPD) would very much have welcomed the introduction by the EU of compulsory contracts at the level of the Member States. However, the Council and the Commission were categorically opposed to this proposal. Nevertheless, the compromise that has been reached allows milk producers throughout Europe to join together in producer organisations. It is of crucial importance for us to ensure that milk producers are put in a stronger position in their negotiations with dairies and retailers. Alongside compulsory contracts, we also strongly supported larger size limits for associations of producer organisations, because that would have further improved the negotiating position of milk producers in Europe. It became clear in this part of the trialogue negotiations that the Council would not have been prepared to accept this, even in the course of a further reading. The opportunity to join together in producer organisations is not a new one for German milk producers because this option is already open to them at a national level as a result of the German Market Structure Act. Given that it was not possible to achieve a better result in the face of opposition from the Council and the Commission, it was all the more important for us to ensure that the interests of small and medium-sized milk producers are taken into consideration in the forthcoming reform of the common agricultural policy (CAP). Conditions must be laid down in the CAP which enable these businesses to continue producing milk even in less favourable regions. This is the only way that we can meet our main requirement, which is to guarantee the existence of a sustainable and multifunctional agricultural industry throughout the whole of Europe.

 Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, let us take a quick look at the harsh economic reality. On the day of the summit, the markets rated Portuguese debt securities for 10-year bonds at 17% interest and for five-year bonds at 20% interest. So much for the question as to the extent to which the summit has helped to calm the economic situation, or the question of to what degree the new intergovernmental treaty has pacified activity on the market. If anyone asks himself where the disquiet is coming from, then perhaps the answer is from the economic data and from the feeling that what we have done is not enough. President Schulz, I would like to thank you expressly for the courage and clarity with which you participated in this summit on behalf of this House in order to say that we will indeed defend the Community method and we certainly want consolidation, but we also need to invest so that Europe’s economies can flourish. I believe that this is a line that this House will be able to agree on, and we will be able to continue to develop a common economic policy. Udo Bullmann  (S&amp;D

Madam President, as the coordinator for the Group of the Progressive Alliance of Socialists and Democrats in the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs, I can confirm that Mr Schwab has tabled an excellent proposal that can be supported by all sides of the House, and would encourage others to follow our lead in supporting it. Udo Bullmann  (S&amp;D

 – (DE)
 Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, what does the result of the summit bring us? With regard to the automatic sanctions, I would simply like you to explain, gentlemen, what happens when a country has more than 3% debt in future and you want to apply automatic sanctions, but the country says that Article 126 and the current Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union apply. What will happen then? Then our finest hour, which Mr Lambsdorff has spoken about, will turn out not to have been so fine after all. It is a fake which is not worth the paper it is written on, because it does not change the real situation. In legal terms, what have you actually done? As far as the economy goes, research institutes are saying that in the next two years, perhaps four of the 17 euro area countries will be in a position to achieve the structural deficit target that you have imposed. Possibly by 2015, but only if we can avoid a recession. However, if we take your route, without a growth initiative, we will find ourselves in the midst of a recession. It is a mistake to believe that we can achieve these targets without additional programmes for growth. How will we do it? What have you decided? Without the European Parliament, you will not be able to get out of the mess that you have got yourselves into. Take the opportunity to sit down at the table with the European Parliament and then you will still have a chance. Otherwise, you will find that there are no cards left on the table. (Applause) Udo Bullmann  (S&amp;D

 Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, we all trust that Mr Daul is right when he says that we are hopefully beginning to see the light at the end of the tunnel in this crisis. The litmus test for this question, however, is not to be found in today’s newspaper headlines, but rather in the economic developments of the coming weeks and months. Paragraph 3 of the resolution states: ‘The European Union must improve its prospects for growth and employment.’ This is absolutely correct. A question last night’s document did not answer, however, is the issue of what is to be done in order to improve the prospects for growth and employment. Much later, in paragraph 25, there is an indication of the intent to work out an appropriate strategy. I hope that this will happen. One thing is clear, however, President of the Commission and President-in-Office of the Council: a strategy of cuts without investment will not see us through this crisis. We are already in a state of stagnation and the threat of recession is not far away. Mr Barroso, this will come at a high cost for the people you have referred to, who are at the receiving end of this series of bad decisions, and who will find themselves with no jobs and no income. That is the reason for my question today: When, Mr Van Rompuy, do you intend coming to this House with these proposals so that they can be approved by Parliament? After all, you said yourself that it is a matter for this House to discuss economic policy with you. We must assume responsibility here in a situation where you are obviously ready to curtail the responsibilities of the national parliaments. That is our present task. We would like to hear your answer. Udo Bullmann  (S&amp;D
). 
 – (DE)
 Mr President, President of the Commission, Commissioner, President-in-Office of the Council, there are two questions that remain unanswered in this debate. The first is that, when we read what the World Bank says, when we read what Ms Lagarde at the International Monetary Fund says, it would seem that we are on the brink of a recession. The growth engines have failed. Where are the investments? That is the urgent question for the European Union. I would like to ask you: you refer to the Stability and Growth Pact – where are the investments? You wanted to cut everything do with investments. So, where are the investments? Where can we cooperate so that we can move forward in Europe once again? We Social Democrats are willing to help in finding a strategy that will allow us to move forward. The second question is this: how can we enter into a common bond market? Here, too, you can be sure of our support. Please put forward proposals. Help to convince those in the Council who are still not convinced. We will help you do this, and we would seek the support of the majority in this House. Udo Bullmann  (S&amp;D
).  
– (DE)
 Mr President, I should like to begin my comments with a question to Commissioner Rehn and to Mr Kármán of the Council. Both have spoken of an outstanding matter in the argument between the parliamentary majority and the Council. This week I noted that the Council had opposed text in the report by Mrs Ferreira, the rapporteur for the Group of the Progressive Alliance of Socialists and Democrats in the European Parliament, concerning the symmetrical approach. Are you able to tell me that this problem has been resolved, because the Council voted in favour of the rapporteur? In actual fact, you would then still have a problem between the majority here and the Council – or did you forget to mention that? If so, I should like to know that too, because then I would think that you consider it unimportant. I should like the two of you to explain this to me at the end of this debate. Listening to the two conservative groups in this House, and also to the liberals, I get the impression that if we adopt what they have tabled here then the world will be put to rights. Unfortunately, that is not the case. The world would subsequently be worse, not better – because they have turned an opportunity to create a more common economic policy in Europe into an austerity package. That is a bad thing, because it represents a policy that dates from the last century, because it represents an outdated approach which merely takes sanctions regimes from political techniques and not incentives, or smart taxation, or balanced approaches such as have been represented by us. Various sides of the House have made sufficient pragmatic proposals to allow a balanced package to be tabled. If Mrs Wortmann-Kool wants to claim that it would be blocked by the greens and the social democrats, that is of course simply nonsense. Exactly the opposite is true. To the Members of this House from the Group of the European People’s Party (Christian Democrats) – who run after either the Commission or the Council – I would state that we are not here to let things through on the nod, but rather to think for ourselves. That is what the voters expect of us. I must therefore point out to you that at present you cannot tell whether a Member State is buying defence hardware, fighter aircraft or investing in its education system of tomorrow. You are not in a position to make a qualitative assessment of its budgetary policy. We do, in fact, want to equip you to do so. We wanted a smarter pact which provides greater opportunity for the Commission to have an influence. I cannot understand why Commissioner Rehn is not agreeing to this – more opportunities for influence and a modern economic policy which makes reference to the EU2020 objectives in the interests of our citizens. You have derailed it, and that is a pity. Consequently, this package is by no means balanced. We will continue to fight for a better economic package. We owe this to our electorate. In truth, the answer has to be ‘more Europe’, not ‘less Europe’. It has to be the right Europe, however – not the wrong package. Udo Bullmann  (S&amp;D
). 
 – (DE)
 Mr President, Mr Langen, I just want to make sure that you are familiar with our ideas. I am therefore asking you whether you are aware of what we proposed to your colleague, Mrs Wortmann-Kool, which was firstly that we strengthen the pact by including closer monitoring of selected objectives proposed by Mr Rehn from the EU2020 package, such as research and development and the fight against poverty. This would also include investment in modernising energy supply systems. Udo Bullmann  (S&amp;D
). 
 – (DE) 
Madam President, the Council and Commission are quite right when they suggest that the public budgets in Europe need to be consolidated. However, if we look at how this works and how it will continue to work in the future, then it is evident that the wrong people are being affected. Schools are being closed, teachers are losing their jobs, researchers are finding themselves out on the street and public investments are being cut or left to stagnate. I would like to ask Mr Van Rompuy and Mr Barroso: Is this your intention? Of course you will say that this is not what you want and that other areas are to be cut back. My question then is: Where are the cuts to be made? My key question is as follows: If you believe that the cuts should be made elsewhere, then why is it that the draft that you propose for decision making in the ‘six-pack’ for economic governance makes no distinction as to whether a country purchases tanks or weapons of war or invests in an ailing national economy, or whether it makes an investment in the future? Or perhaps whether it invests in a modern energy supply system and in the education and training of its children? Romano Prodi once famously said that these drafts are stupid. His words are still true because this distinction between good and bad investments cannot be made. Our only choice is to improve these drafts, because Europe cannot be governed sensibly if such distinctions are beyond us. My last question is: Where is the income to be found that will enable us to move forward out of the crisis? After all, we cannot just save our way out of the problem. Mr Barroso, we await your proposal on the financial transaction tax in Europe, something that this House has backed with a large majority. Give Europe a chance and avoid wasting any more time with pious words. Udo Bullmann,  
on behalf of the S&amp;D Group.

 Mr President, I am sorry, Mr Šemeta, but what you are presenting is not enough. It is months since Parliament gave you the job of investigating what action we can take, including in respect of a financial transaction tax; we gave you the job here in this House. You have not done this. What we know of your position – which has been presented in writing by the Commission on more than one occasion – is something different. You want us to tax the small financial service providers: those that still maintain branches, that care about their customers, that care about medium-sized businesses, that ensure business credit is still available. The parties you do not want to tax are the speculators: those who shift millions and billions around the globe with their high frequency trading, thereby ensuring that our economy is unpredictable – unpredictable even to good entrepreneurs and good investors who want to create decent jobs for the future. Your position is therefore unsatisfactory and consequently, this House must find its own voice. I am sorry to say that Mr Gauzès – whom I otherwise hold in very high esteem – is wrong on this occasion. He is wrong because he is watering down the position adopted by this House previously in the Berès report. Anyone who votes in favour of Mr Gauzès’s proposal will be ensuring that the Commission does what it wants to do anyway – namely, proposes no financial transaction tax. That will be the result of agreeing with Mr Gauzès. That is why it would be wrong to agree with him in this instance. Anyone who wants to give this House a voice, who wants to win back trust, who wants to ensure that the citizens of Europe can once again look to our institutions with hope and a belief that we are doing something to deal with the crises must, in this instance, vote in favour of the alternative motion tabled by the Group of the Progressive Alliance of Socialists and Democrats in the European Parliament and must vote in favour of Amendment 2, which has been endorsed by more than 120 Members of this House from all the major groups. Thank you for your support. Udo Bullmann  (S&amp;D

 Mr President, on behalf of my group I would like to table an oral amendment to strengthen equal opportunities and the aspect of gender policy in the Europe 2020 Strategy. I will read the text out in English – new paragraph 10 a:   ‘Insists that gender equality is a key target for achievement of the ambitions of EU 2020. Calls therefore for the full participation of women in the labour market and the full inclusion of female workers in vocational training. Calls also for an agenda to eradicate the pay gap that exists between women and men.’ (Applause) Udo Bullmann,  
on behalf of the S&amp;D Group.

 Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, Commissioner, President-in-Office of the Council, I have listened closely to what you have said, I have read the Annual Growth Survey, I have read the Ecofin conclusions and now I am absolutely clear about one thing: the European Union is not only experiencing an economic crisis, it is also experiencing a political crisis. What you are recommending to us is nothing new. Ask your staff to show you the documents from the last ten years. The same thing can be seen in all of them, namely that public expenditure is too high, and the only mechanism for adjustment to new times relates to wages and they are always too high. I have not seen any other recommendations. Whether it is raining or snowing, whether we are in a crisis or a boom – it is always the same ideology, but it has nothing whatsoever to do with empirical economic reality. Allow me to suggest something to you: send those people who write these things for you, who carry out the economic analyses in the Council and the Commission, to the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs sometime. We want to get to know your economic models. We want to discuss with them whether they do not see that Europe is on the brink of recession. Remove the German export rates and the German growth rates for example and then you will see what I am talking about. I will then ask you why there is not a single word about investments – when we have lowest level of investment so far, which we ourselves can no longer afford – why there is not a single word about improvements in revenue and nothing about following the cycles or about the fact that we must finally learn to grow together or how we will get out of the crisis. There is nothing about any of these things in your documents. You missed the start of this year, and you will have to make a great effort to meet the expectations of citizens in Europe. However, let me tell you something: if this is the spirit in which you intend to take a decision in March concerning the cconomic governance package and the reform of the Stability and Growth Pact, my group will be unable to be involved in this. Udo Bullmann,  
on behalf of the S&amp;D Group.

Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, why are we here? Mr Barnier said that we are here because the European Parliament has succeeded in establishing European supervisory authorities that are worthy of the name. That was not part of the Council’s programme. It was not part of the Member States’ programme. The Commission, too, had doubts about how long we would actually persevere with regard to the establishment of this new institution. The Council will understand – it will have to understand – and the Commission will, too – possibly even of its own accord – why we are concerned. No, this European Parliament – and this is a statement that I find applies to all party groups, not just to us as Social Democrats – will not allow national games to be played that undermine the powers of these new supervisory authorities. That is why we are interested in the appointment of staff, of course. We have rights in this regard – we have to be consulted. There are one or two things that in fact give us cause for concern. We receive lists of individuals and we receive lists, which when we look at we cannot actually tell whether a gender criterion has been applied. We are given proposals for candidates, which when we consider – and I say this with all due respect to the people concerned – we do not see anyone that we believe could not do a decent job. These are clearly good people who have already shown in their jobs that they can do their work well, but the people that have been presented to us are not people who, on the basis of any authority that they may have demonstrated in their past work, can actually say to the national supervisory authorities where they would stand in the event of a conflict. Where there is European supervision, national momentum comes to a standstill. That surprises and annoys us, and it must call us into action. No, these procedures are unsatisfactory, and I ask myself why, for example, we cannot take the same approach as we are taking with regard to those responsible for OLAF, where you are of course interested in the opinion of this House. Why can we not do that? We still have another opportunity with regard to the executive directors. You can still demonstrate that you are interested in the opinion of the European Parliament. You still have another opportunity. I would urge you both – President-in-Office of the Council and former fellow Member Mrs Győri and Commissioner Barnier, to take this opportunity. You can take on board the objections of this House. You can tell us very clearly how you want to work with us in future. You can tell us very clearly what goals you will support in the 2013 reform and how you will equip the institutions. You will also be able to make it very clear whether you are interested in our opinion in respect of those members of staff that are still to be appointed. I therefore ask you in all earnestness in the interests of Europe to provide these rules quickly. Udo Bullmann  (S&amp;D
).

 Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, in critical situations, Europe has always found a way out of a crisis. Not because different interests have been played off against one another, but because we have combined our interests, which has allowed us to take new paths. I would have liked to ask Mr Barroso a question, but unfortunately he is no longer here. There will, of course, soon be important press conferences on the subject of how we can rescue Europe using the lowest common denominator, but Mr Rehn may be able to pass my question on. I do not understand why we are not taking the following route. Eurobonds are a sensible solution. Mr Schulz has said that on behalf of our group and, in Germany, where this is a critical issue, my party is saying the same thing. The German Government in particular has reservations and there are also reservations in other countries which are paying less interest. Why do we not proceed as follows? We are saying that these problems can be solved. We are now planning to launch eurobonds, but we are putting together a sensible package. What do we need to enable Europe to act? How can we put money into the coffers? How can we create more taxation potential for a sensible, long-term economy? We are launching eurobonds and we are linking this launch with the introduction of the financial transaction tax in the European Union. This package could result in a win-win situation, which would enable everyone to benefit. Ask Mrs Merkel at the European summit if she is prepared to do this. Why is it not possible? Why does the Commission not make a proposal of this kind? It would help everyone and enable a major new project for Europe to emerge from the crisis. I am waiting for the Commission to make this proposal. You must stop trying to talk your way out of it. It is time for you to act in the interest of the citizens of Europe and in the interest of the Member States, so that we can find our way back to a sensible path of growth. Our fate is in your hands, but you must have the courage to take the initiative now. Udo Bullmann,  
on behalf of the S&amp;D Group.

 Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, in her speech this morning, Mrs Harms posed the question of why the spark is no longer being passed from the summits to the people and why new courage and new confidence is not emanating from the summit discussions. As I listened to you this morning and also just now, Mr Barroso, and to Mr Van Rompuy or the Council, too, I got an idea of why the spark is not being passed on. The spark is not even passing into the Chamber here – just look around you. Of course, it is important for more Members to be here. Why are they not here? It is wrong for them not to be here. However, they are not really hearing anything new anyway. You are telling us things that have already been said in the newspapers many times and you are not providing answers to the very pointed questions that have been asked. What is happening with regard to the financial transaction tax? Mr Schulz has asked about this many times. Where is the answer? It is not on the agenda of the G20 summit in Seoul. I would like an explanation. I would also like to know why the European Council, the Belgian Presidency, said that it is in favour of this, but why the European Council at its last three summits merely said that it recommended a feasibility study at global level but not at European level. Why ever not? Does the Council not see the dead end into which you are directing this matter? I will ask you once again, Mr Barroso: when will Mr Šemeta comply with the demand made by this Parliament at the beginning of this year, namely that we want a feasibility study for Europe, too? If you present an opinion on this subject, this Chamber will actually be full and we will listen to you. However, do not avoid the issue any longer. For Europe alone we are talking about EUR 200 billion per year. Ask the Members who belong to the Committee on Budgets what trivial, small amounts they are currently arguing about with the Council. With an initiative we would make progress. We need to breathe life into the roles, then the spark will once again be passed on. That is what we expect from you. Udo Bullmann  (S&amp;D

 Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, as I listen to this debate, I have to admit that it reminds me very much of the debate on the Services Directive. I will tell you why. In that case, too, my fellow Members from the Group of the Greens/European Free Alliance and the Confederal Group of the European United Left – Nordic Green Left declared that there was a regulation on the table in this House that was not perfect, not complete, and yet for years now, they have been grateful for the fact that the Group of the Progressive Alliance of Socialists and Democrats in the European Parliament managed to push it through in this House. That is the truth about this regulation that we will vote on tomorrow. In fact, the improvement made on what the Council and Commission proposed can essentially be attributed to Mr Goebbels and Mrs Regner, who fought for improvements here against the opposition, with the support and excellent cooperation of Mr Gauzès, for which I would like to thank him. In my country, Germany, what we have agreed here for the private equity industry will bring about real improvements for workers and for small and medium-sized enterprises, which no longer need to be afraid of simply being eaten up by the black sheep of the equity industry that do not abide by any standards. These days, when we read and listen to the press telling us that the funds industry is moving its focus away from the Caribbean and towards Europe because it is important to long-term investors that there are good products in which to invest, that supports the work of this Parliament rather than running counter to it. However, before we talk too much about dynamism here, I have to say that my group has been calling for a regulation since 2002. Perhaps there has been evidence of dynamism, but only in the last few weeks. I would like to thank the President-in-Office of the Council and the Commissioner, as you have personally supplied this dynamism. Please tell your colleagues in the Council that, with this method of sluggishness, of ‘yes, but’ and the refusal to put through better regulations in Europe, we will not succeed in getting the next pieces of legislation on derivatives or short selling through. This situation has to change. That is an appeal from this Parliament. Udo Bullmann  (S&amp;D

 Mr President, Mr Chastel, Commissioner, this could actually have been a time of great answers, but in hindsight, it does not look like it. What is on the table for the so-called reform of the Stability and Growth Pact is no great answer; once again, it is the lowest common denominator – the small morsel that could actually be agreed upon. I congratulate the Commission. You are still at the table – the Member States are not quite going it alone. I also congratulate the Council. Success has been achieved, France and Germany have an agreement – we do not know whether it is a good one or a bad one, but at least they are no longer stuck in the quagmire. What does all this mean? It means that next year, if the growth figures collapse again, we will stand up in front of everyone and have no answer to the economic situation. Where is the section, the legal statute, in which you propose how we can together learn to drag ourselves out of the debt crisis? That is where my group feels there is a gap and that is the debate that we are going to have in this House. Yes, we agree with those Members who want greater commitment to reform. That is something that we want too. However, we then need to discuss the substance. If you are not prepared to provide a more solid foundation for the actual orientation of our budgetary policy, then we can see no reason to continue discussing EU 2020. It is already a paper tiger – we can throw it in the waste paper basket today if you will not debate the substance of it with us more forcefully. We want to make a difference. Yes, it makes a difference whether we invest in limping bureaucracy or in the energy sources and jobs of the future. Where is the point in your proposals where we can make this difference? That is what we are waiting for. This debate has yet to take place. That will be the decisive thing for us. Moreover, we will not accept a catalogue of indicators that is based on the legislation. This Parliament will not have the wool pulled over its eyes. We want to debate whether employment and unemployment are an important feature of budgetary development or not, and we want to do so before the legislation is passed. Udo Bullmann,  
on behalf of the S&amp;D Group.

 Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, let me just point one thing out before I start. The Basel Committee is a group of more or less intelligent central bankers and overseers, but it is certainly no infallible council of wise men and it is definitely not the law. This House is the legislative body – Commissioner, you know that, and we know that you do – and this legislative body will pay close attention to what is put on the table and, where it makes sense, to what is put on the table here, too. Clearly, we do want the rules on capital requirements to be tightened up. How could we not want that, in the wake of the economic crisis in which we still find ourselves? 20 to 30% of the gross national product of our national economies are in pawn as the rescue package for the banks. The people expect us, of course, to make respectable banking rules so that we do not find ourselves in a crisis like this one again. Clearly, we want there to be counter-cyclical elements in this banking safeguard like those, for example, that have already been proving their worth in Spain for years. Although there, too, they had to be implemented in the face of opposition, they are paying off today because they were implemented at an appropriately early point and they did not make the banking system worse; they made it more robust. There are key issues, though, and I am truly grateful to the rapporteur, Mr Karas, for having put these key issues at the heart of his own-initiative report, which we find ourselves absolutely and totally able to support. The first of these is that, yes, indeed, we do need an impact study, specifically a complex impact study that makes it clear what the impact is, for one thing, on the financial sector in all its parts but also, of course, in particular, what the impact is on the real economy. What is the impact on the issue of what the future actually holds for loan financing conditions for small and medium-sized enterprises? The second issue is that we need the certainty that this time, unlike in the past, the agreements will also be implemented in other territories. We need to know that before we legislate, as otherwise there will be a new asymmetry for which we cannot be responsible. The third issue is that there can be no discrimination in terms of legal forms. Those forms among the diversity of the European banking system that particularly proved themselves during the financial crisis – and that means those banks that looked after the small and medium-sized business sector and those banks that were focusing on private customers and thus did not elicit cross-border risks – must not be penalised for the solidarity of their establishment. The proposal on the table at the moment does not do enough to ensure this. We therefore believe that the proposals need to now be improved and that we need to consider how we can tackle this issue in practical terms. Public banking overall is of major value, provided it can be run on a sensible basis. We do also need to ask – and I am thinking here about silent partnership reserves – how this will actually be effected in future, if we buy the regulations as they are envisaged in Basel. This cannot be the last word, nor is it the final version that we will accept. The capital instruments need to be measured in order to see the extent to which they ensure consistent quality without false provisos, are available to absorb losses, are durable and flexible in terms of payment, as the rapporteur also argues in his report. It is a reasonable starting position for us to take. We want the leverage effects to be limited and reasonable allowance to be made for the different risk profiles. We will examine your proposal, therefore, Commissioner, and we hope for the best of cooperation with Parliament. Udo Bullmann,  
on behalf of the S&amp;D Group.

Madam President, Mr Reynders, Commissioner, congratulations on your supervision. Parliament has worked hard on this issue and you have also played your part, which is why the results are so good. We must always look to new tasks and, unfortunately, I must point out that good results are still a long way off in other areas. Let me just say that the regulation of hedge fund managers is still nowhere near a breakthrough. At this point, I would call on both sides, both the Council and the Commission, to get cracking. After all, without your efforts, the regulations will not be of much use. We need equal rights for all. Managers outside the European Union must always be subject to the same conditions as their European counterparts. Otherwise, we are putting Europe at a disadvantage. It is not our aim to put a whole industry behind bars. However, if we do not achieve meaningful improvements that will prevent the black sheep from plundering well-functioning businesses, we are not going to have good regulation. I want to issue this warning: you should not imagine that you will score an easy victory by simply playing the various Members of this House off against each other. If you fail to introduce effective regulation, the whole of Europe will know who it was who went down on bended knee before the lobbyists and that knowledge will give these discussions a different character. A word about the financial transaction tax: My view of this is diametrically opposed to that of the Group of the European People’s Party (Christian Democrats). Europe is waiting for answers. You will have to provide these answers. Do not come back from the G20 summit and tell us: ‘Unfortunately we have achieved nothing, so now there is nothing we can do.’ On the contrary, we need to take action in Europe, which is why we need to plan and implement some decisive measures together with the people in Europe. Remember one thing during your negotiations at the G20 summit: we need a response from you, otherwise there is going to have to be a European response. Udo Bullmann  (S&amp;D

Madam President, as the coordinator for the Group of the Progressive Alliance of Socialists and Democrats in the European Parliament, I would like to make a comment on Amendment 6. I would like to call on my group to vote in favour of Amendment 6, in contrast to what appears on our voting recommendations. This is a mistake in the list. We should vote for Amendment 6 and this is likely to clarify the way in which we will vote now in a decisive situation. Udo Bullmann  (S&amp;D

 Mr President, Mr López Garrido, ladies and gentlemen, I would like to ask you to pass on a message to the other members of the Council. The time for the policy of excuses is over. It is important that you do not decide tomorrow that Parliament should adopt the supervisory package and the hedge funds package more quickly as part of the regulation of the financial markets, while the Council – and I do not mean you personally, Mr López Garrido, but I want to encourage you to help us – simultaneously puts on the brakes and prevents us from finding solutions. The trialogue of the Council, the Commission and Parliament is meeting in this House at the same time to discuss the issue of regulating hedge funds. We have proposed appropriate regulations, which prevent the finance industry from gobbling up industrial firms using speculative funds and bringing the real economy to its knees. However, the Council is blocking these regulations. Please tell the Heads of State or Government that the time for the policy of excuses is long gone. It is no longer acceptable for them to give big speeches at home about the regulations that Europe can introduce and then to chicken out when their officials begin working at a European level. The time for this is past and we can no longer afford to behave in this way in the context of the economic crisis. I would like to ask you the same question, Mr Barroso. It does not matter whether you are mentioning the word ‘growth’ here for the 49th, 52nd or 64th time. It is much more important for you to explain why it is that, as the Economic and Financial Affairs Council (Ecofin) stated the day before yesterday, the Member States of the European Union will have to make huge cuts amounting to 3.5% of their gross national product, but you are not telling us how you will use this money to prevent a dreadful catastrophe on the labour market. In this situation, we must learn to grow together. However, you need to explain how this will happen. Otherwise, the Europe 2020 strategy will not be worth the paper it is written on. We need real answers instead of fictitious answers and excuses in order to ensure that the institutions which you represent are part of the solution and not part of the problem. Udo Bullmann  (S&amp;D

 Mr President, Mr López Garrido, ladies and gentlemen, I have a very specific question which will allow us to emerge from the position of powerlessness and confusion that the crisis has left us in, with no one knowing how the crisis arose and how we can find our way out of it. Mr Schulz has referred to the highly critical speculative products and credit default insurance and to the damaging practice of short selling, which brought Greece to the brink of disaster and could represent a major problem for Portugal and many other countries. Mr López Garrido, you have frequently attended the Economic and Financial Affairs Council (Ecofin) in recent months, why was it not possible for the Member States to take concerted action to ban these products? I have been asking this question in the capital of my own country over recent weeks and months and it has taken you months, in fact until yesterday evening, to introduce a ban on the damaging practice of short selling. I ask myself why we have to wait until things have gone wrong before making use of the appropriate legislative measures, which are already in place, to protect the people and the economies of Europe. I believe it has something to do with the Council’s dreadful, discouraging slowness to act, which you have referred to. I will make a deal with you. We in the European Parliament are presenting concrete proposals. In the context of regulating the supervisory bodies and the discussion about hedge funds, we have proposed that we should take appropriate measures on a European level and we will make the same resolution on derivatives, if you, Mr Langen, do what you are always saying. We are calling on you urgently to ensure that the Council finally begins to work with us to put in place legislation so that we in Europe are able to act and no longer have to wait for ever for the Council to make a move. We need to have the tools at our disposal in Europe to enable us to make progress. Please help to make sure that this happens in the Council. However, the decisive point is that the Council must take action on the legislation. Udo Bullmann  (S&amp;D
).

 Madam President, Mr Hökmark, I think we have been in different parliaments in recent years, because the parliament I have experienced is different to yours! I have experienced a parliament in which some say we must look more closely into ratings agencies, hedge funds and private equity corporations. We must regulate them, we must carry out checks on the critical players in the financial markets and the critical products to ensure that we are not veering towards an international fiasco. I have also heard others saying ‘hands off’: the market will regulate itself, we do not need all that. Or as Mr McCreevy said – whenever politics interferes, the result is always worse. We have seen the results. The international fiasco is the cause of the overindebtedness of the Member States of the European Union. However, we cannot stand here today and say that it was wrong to focus our growth policy on employment and economic activity. It is irrelevant to the debate, just as it is irrelevant to the debate when Mr Langen says that Chancellor Merkel understood the European Treaty. No, she did not understand it at all. What is worse, she is probably in a position to subordinate the European Treaty and its aims for Europe to her fear of losing an important regional election in North Rhine-Westphalia. These are not the leadership skills that we need in the European Union. We have told the Commission here that EU 2020 is too watered down. There is no meat in it. Please provide some evidence that you are able to acquire new funds. Please fight for a financial transactions tax. Please fight for more economic activity and greater growth prospects in the European Union, to give small and medium-sized enterprises and the workers a chance. Right now, however, we almost sympathise with you for having to save the European Union with governments such as we have at present – governments such as that represented by Chancellor Merkel. Stay strong and create European instruments! That is our main message for the summit, because only then can people hope that we will provide the right answers. Udo Bullmann,

Mr President, Commissioner, I would like to chip in with a few questions on what Mr Scicluna has stated on behalf of the Committee. Commissioner, if there are 70, 80, 90 or 100 times as many financial transactions in the world as gross national product, and if this development is becoming ever more dynamic, would you then say speculative elements are, for the greater part, linked to this explosion of financial products? If so, how do you then plan to curb them, or what might contribute to curbing them? If short-term financial transactions increase more and more relative to gross national product in the world, do you then share our view that we must strengthen the long-term approach in the real economy, where people work, earn money and manufacture products that we can consume and that we can use. If you share this opinion, by what way and means do you believe will we then be able to achieve this? Commissioner, if the tax on financial transactions can make a contribution to this – that is what we want to look into – what would the timeframe be for negotiating this with international partners? We have the impression that the financial instruments that were created in the world are being used right now to speculate against the euro area and against the euro and to act against the weakest Member States. Is it not high time now that we dealt with this and define a European approach? Commissioner, there is one thing I cannot understand, namely why we are urging Member States to raise value added tax by three or four or more percentage points, when a transaction tax of 0.01 or 0.05 percentage points will supposedly ruin competition and weaken Europe’s position. I cannot believe that. Take action. That is what Parliament wishes. Udo Bullmann,

Mr President, Commissioner, the Single Euro Payments Area is an important, indeed central, instrument of the European single market. It is thanks to Mr Gauzès that we have got it off the ground. My group is fully behind it and would like to see it working well. I personally also have nothing against us setting a deadline for the migration, and here to me it is not so much a question of whether it takes three, four or five months as the fact that it then actually works. Whether it actually works depends on two things. Firstly the appeal to industry that it must be end-user friendly. These days, we cannot afford any rumours, any secret resistance, any hankering after the old system. Therefore, it must be functioning properly, also in respect of those who ultimately have to use it. Secondly, it must, of course, also work for the benefit of the economy. Here I would like to mention one point, which is still a bone of contention, namely the matter of how direct debits will be calculated. Here, the economy does not yet seem to be in a position to propose a sensible model. There are still snags, there are still sticking points and if the economy is not in a position to present a common model that works within the European Union, then the Commission – as stipulated in this proposal for a resolution – must present a concrete proposal within a certain period of time, let us say before the end of the year. It should not be the case that we confront the economy and demand a deadline for the migration, but do not take the initiative to remove the resistance that the payment service providers are obviously not in the position to overcome single-handedly. We need a community initiative here, so the whole thing can work. That is our approach to the discussion. Udo Bullmann  (S&amp;D

 Madam President, President of the European Council, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, I would like to briefly address two points. Firstly, do we already have a Europe 2020 strategy that promises success? No, as yet, we do not. I will tell you why. If, in the Commission and the Member States, you say that we will first carry out a rapid consolidation of the budgets and then deal with the economy and employment, then this is a miscalculation. If you do not believe us, read the statement issued by the International Monetary Fund yesterday. Private sector demand is a long way from recovery. We are concerned about public investment. If you do not pursue an integrated strategy with specific employment goals at the centre, we will have no chance of dealing with the crisis. Secondly, do we have an answer to the debt crisis in the countries that are under the most pressure? No, as yet we do not. More than one country has made mistakes. However, if you read the data carefully and listen to the analysts, then you know that at least half of the Greek excesses are the fault of speculators – the speculators that, for five years, the Commission did not want to regulate – the hedge funds. Now we are finally doing that, but what does it actually mean in practice? We need a European monetary fund, a fund to help these countries. We need to be able to offer credit at sensible rates not only outside the euro area, but within it, too, with conditions attached. However, we need to establish a European policy to solve the crisis – and we need to do so now. Udo Bullmann,

Madam President, Mr Almunia, during this transition period in particular, I thank you for your commitment to your previous mandate and I wish you luck in your new role. I would also like to extend this wish to your successor, Mr Rehn. I wish him courage and luck for the important tasks he is taking on. There are three things we can learn from the present situation. The first is that what Mr Barroso has presented to us as Europe 2020 is lacking in substance. It is a long way from being sufficient to create the coherence in the European Union that we urgently need in order to prevent the situation that we are currently facing from occurring again in the future. This strategy needs substance, and I hope that the scheduled milestones in the next few weeks will provide the opportunity to improve on it. We urgently need better coordination of economic policy. The Spanish Presidency is right to emphasise this. The Presidency should not allow itself to be intimidated in this regard. The second thing we can learn from the current situation is that some Member States are, of course, in need of modernisation and the figures are surely correct in this regard. However, there is a need for modernisation in more than one country. There are also countries that have to do more, because they are able to do more. I have no doubt that the new Greek Finance Minister, Mr Papakonstantinou, will do an excellent job and I do not know any sincere politicians who would dispute that. He deserves our trust and we should give him our support. The third thing we can learn is that the European Union must be armed. If the markets put the euro area to the test, then Europe must be a position to respond to this and it must be possible for the response to be unconventional. If there is further speculation against individual countries, we must be in a position to make credit available under average European rating terms. That will need to be organised. We can find support for this kind of action in the Treaty of Lisbon. I would say to the Council and the Commission: be prepared for the need to negotiate. Udo Bullmann  (S&amp;D

 Mr President, even as we today congratulate Mrs Alvarez, Mr Domenici and our other fellow members on their excellent reports, even as we congratulate Commissioner Kovács on his committed work and wish him all the best with his future work, and even as we express the hope that he will pass on to his successor the passion with which he has fought for a common tax policy, we must also then mention Member States, those Member States who continue to hesitate in taking action that is more than necessary in this crisis situation, action which will finally usher in better cooperation. It is quite shocking that we still have not made any breakthrough on the question of the tax base. Anyone who thinks that they will be able to defend their sovereignty in this way will lose it, just as they will lose their tax revenue. Therefore, the main message of these reports is that we must forge better cooperation in Europe. Only that will lead to progress! Udo Bullmann,  
on behalf of the S&amp;D Group.

Mr President, President-in-Office of the Council, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, first and foremost, there can be no ‘as you were’ in the current economic situation. That will only allow us to make a slow recovery and we shall see a further dramatic increase in unemployment figures, including here in Europe. You must therefore be bold. That is the most important message this Parliament can give the Pittsburgh delegates. Be bold! Mr Almunia, I have listened to a refreshing speech from you, on which I should like to congratulate you. Now you need to start putting it into practice. It is good to start with the bonus systems, but it is not enough. We need a gear shift wherever short-term speculators are at an advantage on the international financial market, because the rules are wrong, over those who wish to make long-term investments in jobs, in products of excellence and in the long-term success of their company. It is right to say that no risky players, no risky financial centre can remain without reasonable regulation, which is why we need regulation of the offshore centres from which dubious products are flooding the entire world. That is the most important task that we must now set ourselves. Nor should you be frightened of discussing fiscal policy – it is not prohibited. A global transaction tax which benefits long-term investors would take us forward in this discussion as a whole. We need strong, improved coordination of our international, as well as our European, economic policy. It is right to think about an exit strategy, but it is even more important at the moment that we work out how we can give more solid support to the economy and improve the coordination of our economic policy. Udo Bullmann,  
on behalf of the S&amp;D Group.

 Mr President, Commissioners, ladies and gentlemen, in this situation, where, after a struggle that has gone on for months, the way is finally open to a solution in which, of the in excess of 50 000 directly-affected jobs, probably – at least according to what the new investors are telling us – around 40 000 can be saved, not counting the many jobs amongst suppliers and in dependent local businesses, it is now time to address the workforce of General Motors in Europe. It was their dispute, they – Klaus Franz as the Chairman of the Full Works Council and all the others – became the face of Opel Europe, from a new technology group that has earned its opportunity, and in such a situation, our policy must help. What is it that we are discussing? We are discussing how General Motors in the US staggered on for months. It came within a whisker – and we know this for certain, ladies and gentlemen – of failing. What, then, could have been more reasonable than to have seized the initiative, moved forwards and said, ‘OK then. We have to jump in here and give people a chance. We must give not just the production sites, but also the future technologies, a chance so that Europe can remain a good place to produce cars.’ I can fully identify with the outlook that Commissioner Špidla set out for the European car industry. Let us make it real! Let us create an industrial policy framework with world-leading environmental standards so that employees and car makers in Europe can develop within them right here. We managed it before with coal and steel. Why should we not also now succeed in doing it for the industry of mobility and the future? Grab the ball! The Commission has a lot of room to act here, and it can launch a lot of initiatives. Commissioner Kroes, according to my information, of the 4.5 billion that form part of the deal that has to be reached, you have already approved 1.5 billion so that the wheels keep turning. Naturally, you must check the law and the legislation – what is the alternative? Of course, all necessary steps must be taken to bring about a fair distribution of burdens in the future negotiations. I implore you, however, to conduct your checks quickly, to consistently come to a conclusion but, given what is at stake, it is absolutely vital that this opportunity not be destroyed. It must not fail on trivialities. Instead, we must also note the significance of the situation and we must achieve a European solution, in the public interest, that benefits everyone.

Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, with our report on small-scale fishing, we are underlining the fact that we are sensitive to the needs of traditional and artisanal fishermen and listen to their concerns. Traditional fishing produces more jobs and less CO2
 per kilo of catch than industrial fishing. The small-scale fishing lobby, however, is weaker. That is why we must be vigilant and ensure that it is not put at a disadvantage in the allocation of quotas, for example. We will also be voting tomorrow on Parliament’s position on the external dimension of the Common Fisheries Policy. This report is intended to form the basis for our future decisions, for example on fisheries agreements. I am pleased that with one exception, all groups were able to agree on a text.  A minority has now drafted a resolution which I hope will be rejected by a majority of the House. The comments that have been made about shark-finning give me cause for optimism. Here, the PPE appears to be endorsing the majority opinion, albeit at the last minute. Shark-finning must be banned in the EU at long last, without any legal loopholes. Ulrike Rodust  (S&amp;D

 Mr President, Mr Cioloş, ladies and gentlemen, we are in the middle of reforming the common agricultural policy and Parliament, in its new role of colegislator, will tomorrow adopt the first regulation from the reform package on the application of direct payments for the transitional year 2013. This is a positive development and an important moment. I would particularly like to thank the rapporteur, Mr Capoulas Santos, for his very good work which, most importantly, was completed quickly. This regulation must come into force on 1 January 2014 to ensure that there are no financing problems during the transition from the current regulation to the next reformed regulation on direct payments. Therefore, it was particularly important for Parliament and the Council to reach an agreement quickly. Continuity in financing is a decisive factor for the Member States. This is why it is so important that the transitional regulation for 2013 comes into force at the right time. The current regulation on direct payments remains valid in 2013, but some of the financial provisions in the regulation only apply until 2012. I welcome the solution identified by Parliament and the Council, and particularly the transfer from Pillar 1 to Pillar 2. Ulrike Rodust  (S&amp;D

 Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I welcome the fact that we are drawing attention to the animal disease caused by the Schmallenberg virus today through this oral question, as it shows that we take this issue seriously. Many farmers have been waiting desperately for this moment. As you have already heard, 944 holdings have already been hit by the Schmallenberg virus in Germany alone. This has caused huge problems for these farms. Because of its proximity to the coast and the protection of its dykes, my own region of Schleswig-Holstein has a large number of sheep farmers. Many sheep have been infected with this virus. The virus threatens the survival of many farming businesses, particularly at present in the lambing season. The number of cases continues to rise. Both sheep and beef farmers are suffering from the effects of this virus in Schleswig-Holstein. In the last week alone, the number of cases in my region has risen from 106 farms with infected animals last week to 116 farms this week. Even though the virus does not pose a threat to humans, farming businesses are suffering serious financial losses due to deformities and still-births. I would also like to draw your attention to the suffering of the animals. I believe that this is also something unacceptable. We urgently need a vaccine. I would be interested to know what progress has been made by researchers in this regard and whether the Commission is supporting Member States in the search for a vaccine. Perhaps we should also consider whether it is possible to help the farms that have been financially hit by the virus in some other way. What options are open to the Commission here and what steps have already been taken? Please act quickly and keep us informed of developments. Our farmers are counting on you, and on us.

 Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, what are we dealing with here today? We are trying to adopt multi-annual plans for our fishing stocks in order to bring an end to overfishing in our seas. Multi-annual plans are the key tool in our fisheries policy. The fish in question today, the Atlantic horse mackerel, is just one example of many. We aim to produce management plans for all commercially fished species. Almost exactly 16 months ago, we were here in the House and Parliament adopted its position on this multi-annual plan. We have had the attempt to negotiate with the Council. Unfortunately nothing came of the talks, as the fisheries ministers within the Union apparently would like to work without involving Parliament when it comes to important issues. Over the past 16 months, the Council has not budged an inch. It has demonstrated complete obstinacy, a quality that is not a bad one to have in politics, but in this case it is scandalous. The Council has ensured that there are absolutely no new long-term management plans in place. It is as if the tug of war between the institutions were more important than a sensible policy for our fishermen, for our environment and for our citizens. If we want people to be satisfied with the European Union, we must deliver results. In the area of fisheries policy, we have not done that for two years now. In the past, European fisheries policy was in the sole hands of the Council of Ministers. Unfortunately, the result was a disaster. That the ministers should now have the idea of continuing to make policy without Parliament’s involvement seems, against that backdrop, to be something of a bad joke! If we were to actually negotiate with one another about the reform of the common fisheries policy the citizens of the European Union would also observe who was going into bat for a progressive policy and who was putting the brakes on. Ministers, please take a look at yourselves and then manoeuvre yourselves out of this dead end as soon as possible. Ulrike Rodust  (S&amp;D

 Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, I welcome the approach taken in the regulation on contractual relations in the milk sector of strengthening the negotiating position of milk producers and ensuring fairer prices. It is important that we do not leave the milk producers high and dry once the milk quotas are abolished. Small and medium-sized family businesses, in particular, rely on the fact that they are supported by the European Union and not left unprotected at the mercy of the milk purchasers and retailers. I would have liked for us to have introduced mandatory contracts at Member State level. However, the Council and the Commission fought tooth and nail against the idea. It is a shame that the Council is not here now. I believe that the compromise that has now been reached is acceptable, but it does not go far enough. Therefore, we must ensure that the interests of small and medium-sized milk producers, in particular, are taken into consideration in the upcoming reform of the common agricultural policy. My main concern will continue to be fighting for a sustainable and multi-functional agriculture that covers the whole of Europe. Ulrike Rodust  (S&amp;D

 Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I am very pleased to see this topic addressed in plenary and I would like to offer my thanks to Mr Bové. It really is a very important issue that we are debating today, be it for producers, processors, for trade or for consumers. Production costs for farmers have risen sharply over recent years. Farmers can primarily feel the increasing overheads when it comes to energy bills and agricultural inputs. The heavy concentration of food retailing, above all, makes it more difficult for producers to obtain good prices for their products. Although the mark-up between the primary and the end product is sometimes considerable, not much of that reaches producers, as some of the margin is lost to each of the various processing steps. Politicians can intervene in competition policy, but we must be careful when doing so, and, in certain areas, we have to trust to market forces. I consider it important to let consumers know that buying regional products from their producers or makers supports both the farmers and the local economy. That is where I see our role. We should intervene in this connection, be it with money or with political instruments. I believe strengthening regionalism provides a tool to do this. In the reform of the common agricultural policy, we need to make other tools available. For me as a Social Democrat, it is important that access to wholesome food at reasonable prices should be guaranteed for all, while, at the same time, farmers must be able to receive a fair and reasonable income for their work. This demand requires us not to shirk our responsibility, and indeed to live up to it. Every time we act, we need to ask ourselves if we are living up to these demands. If not, the result will be social unrest in the long run. Farmers and consumers are in the same boat. Let us ensure that that boat never sinks. Ulrike Rodust,

 Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, this House has now been dealing with the fisheries agreement between the European Union and Morocco for over a year, and I am sure that tomorrow’s vote will not be the end of it. This agreement has become a highly emotive issue. The whole of Parliament is talking about the agreement; the debate has been a matter of controversy within all the groups in recent days and weeks. This is a fisheries agreement that needs careful analysis. What is the result of such analysis? Those of us who are members of the Committee on Fisheries are agreed that this agreement is not ecologically sustainable, because it contributes to overfishing. I regret to say that this has rather been forgotten in the debate so far, but nonetheless it is a key point. In view of the catastrophic state of the world’s seas, the European Union should not be allowed to overfish its own waters, much less waters belonging to third countries. This protocol also has no economic merit. There is no win-win situation for us. In addition, there remains the Western Sahara question. I am sure we are agreed that the agreement must be in accordance with international law. The current protocol on which we are going to vote has all these shortcomings. For this reason, it is not possible to vote in favour of it. We are now being consoled with the idea that it will all change in the future. I hope that is so, and that our resolution will help the Council and the Commission to get things right in the negotiations with Morocco. The only convincing reason for voting in favour is that the protocol is about to expire and the Commission has asked us not to bring about a break in it, because that would make the new negotiations more difficult. It assures us that all our demands will be incorporated into the new protocol. Not only is that something I am expecting, but indeed I am relying on it being the case. Ulrike Rodust  (S&amp;D

 Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, illegal fishing poses a serious threat to our fish stocks and to all honest fishermen, who are being swindled out of part of their income. At this point, I would like to take the unusual step of praising the Council of Ministers, which succeeded in agreeing an IUU regulation before the Treaty of Lisbon came into force, in other words, without our cooperation. That was an important step forward. However, Ms Lövin’s excellent report makes it clear that there is still a lot of work to do. Illegal fishing is a typical example of problems that are so big that the European Union cannot deal with them on its own. We need global solutions. The fact is that global solutions require effective global institutions. As the rapporteur on reform of the common fisheries policy, I would like to close with the following remark: the best protection against illegal fishing is afforded by fishermen who know the rules and who are convinced that these make sense. This must be our guiding principle in pursuing new reforms. Ulrike Rodust  (S&amp;D

 Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I would like to make one thing clear in advance. As a Social Democrat, it is important to me to help needy people. However, for me the focus is primarily on creating jobs, in order to enable people to take care of themselves. In my opinion, the food aid programme for needy people in its current form is not the right way of helping people to help themselves. I see this as charity, which is damaging to people’s dignity. It seems relatively clear to me that buying food and distributing it free of charge to needy people is not agricultural policy. It falls within the realms of social policy. Under the terms of the current legal basis, social policy is a matter for the Member States. In Germany there is a system of food banks. Volunteer helpers collect food which can no longer be used by supermarkets, for example. Given the fact that 89 million tonnes of food goes to landfill every year in Europe, initiatives of this kind make sense, but they are also charitable in nature. Let us create sensible infrastructures to ensure that people do not have to rely on charity. This means, for example, allowing them to be independent by providing good jobs and good pensions.

 Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, I would like to thank the rapporteur and I am pleased that the report bears unmistakably socialist, social democratic hallmarks. We want a sustainable, ecological and social agricultural policy. We want greening and we want it in the first pillar. Cross-compliance and the agro-environmental measures of the system to date are not enough to achieve support for the whole of society, but that is precisely what we need. Our primary objective must be to ensure high-quality and sustainable food production in Europe and for our rural areas to be active and vital. We absolutely have to stop the increasing land abandonment, because we need people. People to look after the agricultural sector, as well as the areas upstream and downstream. The rumours emanating from the Commission concerning plans for massive cuts in rural development in the next multiannual financial framework are not acceptable. We must continue to work for a strong second pillar in the common agricultural policy (CAP), for rural areas and for Europe. I would like to issue a general warning to anyone intending to cut agricultural funding. If this is done, there will be no reform. Everything will then stay the same as it is. That will be quite inexplicable to the citizens of Europe. Ulrike Rodust  (S&amp;D

 Mr President, Commissioner, I come from the region of Europe where the outbreak of the EHEC pathogen is at its raging worst. This aggressive bacteria seems unstoppable. Between mid-May and noon yesterday, 1 733 people were infected, while 23 patients died a torturous death. The situation in the clinics is extremely fraught. Intensive care beds are running out, and blood plasma is needed urgently. No end is in sight. The people of my home area fear new cases every day. For me, it is a question of courage and a sense of responsibility to warn about every even potential carrier of this bacterium. Various foodstuffs have been analysed, but it has not been found. My understanding of high grade foodstuffs is that they are healthy and that they are placed on the market subject to monitoring. I am presuming that glaring errors have been made in this regard, and once again, we are finding out that there are loopholes. However, to claim, in this situation, that the cause is known, without having well-founded laboratory research to back it up, is negligent in the extreme. In all the understandable panic, there must not, under any circumstances, be a witch-hunt, as that would drive many hard-working farmers throughout Europe to the wall. It therefore needs to be clear to everyone that we in the European Union need to show solidarity with one another and stand ready to provide mutual assistance in the event of emergencies. In other words, all the medical experts must sit down together, and economic assistance needs to be provided to those who innocently find themselves facing financial disaster. Ulrike Rodust  (S&amp;D

 Madam President, Mr Andor, ladies and gentlemen, we must do everything we can to counteract the spread of antibiotic resistance. We are in complete agreement on this. This involves the responsible use of antibiotics in human medicine and in animal husbandry. The European Union must take determined action. We must not allow 25 000 people to go on dying from infections caused by resistant bacteria every year in the European Union alone. Antibiotics must not be used routinely or preventively. We must ensure that antibiotics are used responsibly in all the Member States. It is of the utmost importance that every possible effort is made to keep livestock healthy from the rearing stage onwards, until they are fully grown. Ensuring that animals are healthy is the best means of avoiding infection and the use of antibiotics. The way the animals are fed is decisive in this respect, but the husbandry is also important. We should also be open to the use of alternative methods, such as homeopathy and phytotherapy, in livestock husbandry. We need more research and more information in Europe about these alternative approaches. Ulrike Rodust  (S&amp;D

Madam President, open borders are an important symbol for Europe. I would like to draw your attention to another problem. I come from Northern Germany, which is why the German-Danish border is of particular importance for me. The right-wing populist Danish People’s Party is trying to force the Danish Government to reintroduce border controls. What is the reason for this? It is a fear of people from Romania and Bulgaria. This is scandalous. The right-wing populists are rapidly growing in numbers and represent a real danger for Europe. Of course we must have protections against untrammelled criminality and our security authorities have already found effective alternatives to passport controls. It makes me very sad that one of our major European achievements is to be put at risk. The EU success in promoting peace and freedom is without historical parallel but is now under high-level attack. I would call on the Danish Government not to allow itself to be dictated to by the right-wing populists. Ulrike Rodust,

 Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, European fisheries are in a state of deep crisis, as my fellow Members have said. Fishermen in all European seas complain about the painful drop in income, which may be severe enough to threaten their existence. Yet, why is the income of our fishermen decreasing? As far as I can see, there are three reasons for this. Firstly, there is the decline in fish stocks; secondly, the general fall in prices in precisely the area where fish stocks are healthy and supply is too high; and thirdly – and this is what we are concerned about today – operating costs are higher as a result of rising crude oil prices. We politicians need to step in here. We must do what we can to help. I would stress that we can only do what we can. The motion for a resolution tabled by the Group of the European People’s Party (Christian Democrats) promises more than we can deliver. It demands an increase of 100% in the de minimis
 aid ceiling from EUR 30 000 to EUR 60 000, which is to be used to fund fuel subsidies. However, fuel subsidies are something that many Member States really cannot afford. Therefore, most fishermen would not be helped by this at all. Moreover, the other two problems would still remain: firstly, overfishing would actually increase and, secondly, it would not solve the problem of market prices. Where financial support for fisheries is concerned, I can see a much greater problem. The Member States do not use the resources of the European Fisheries Fund, although the European Union pays 50%. Something urgently needs to change in this regard in the interests of our fishermen. Ladies and gentlemen, let us work together to produce a differentiated text by Thursday and jointly come up with a sensible, sustainable and less showy fisheries policy. Ulrike Rodust,

 Mr President, Commissioner Damanaki, ladies and gentlemen, once again we find a whole package of fisheries policies on the agenda. In my capacity as coordinator, I am pleased to see that we have reached a compromise with the Council and Commission on two regulations. I refer to the Grelier report on technical measures and the Ferreira report on the second financial instrument. We shall also be able to vote in favour of the fisheries agreement with the Union of the Comoros, although I do not wish to hide the fact that I would like to see a fundamental realignment of the partnership agreements within the framework of the reform of the common fisheries policy. However, there are real problems between the institutions in relation to Greenland, where Parliament’s powers are not respected. I am gradually losing patience with the fact that the level of cooperation between the institutions is still so poor. This is something that I have raised time and time again already. I am raising the issue again today. The problem with the management plans must be resolved as a matter of urgency. I would appeal to the Hungarian Presidency of the Council to actively press for a solution. The fact that there is no representative from the Council here today is a clear sign of the Council’s lack of respect for Parliament. I find this incredible. One final remark about the Grelier report. I am aware that some of my fellow Members are frustrated because it was not possible to incorporate the amendments they wanted. However, I find it very regrettable that our fishermen are forced to work with out-of-date technical measures. The fault in this case lies with the Council, which has been unable to agree to a new regulation. As a Parliament we have a great deal of responsibility, which is why we need to act responsibly and extend the existing regulation without amendments. Ulrike Rodust  (S&amp;D

Madam President, food prices have reached new record highs. The volatility of food prices has increased in recent years for various reasons. There is, therefore, great cause for concern. Climate change is causing extreme weather conditions and in some countries whole crops have been destroyed. In addition, there is increasing speculation on food, the danger of which cannot be overestimated – you only have to look at the financial crisis. Moreover, there is increasingly often competition between providing food for the poor and running the cars of the rich. We need to find solutions so that farmers have sufficient incentive to produce food and that only areas that are not used for food production are used for the production of the likes of biofuels. For me as a Social Democrat it is important that everyone has access to wholesome food at reasonable prices and at the same time that farmers are able to receive a reasonable income for their work. Ulrike Rodust,

Madam President, Commissioner, I am rather surprised by your remarks. My perception of the press – at least in Germany – is somewhat different. It makes me extremely angry, too, that again and again, we are faced with scandals in the area of food safety. We cannot allow this to happen. I am aware that regulations and laws alone cannot prevent criminal activities in this area. However, we must do everything we can to make it as difficult as possible for those responsible. The Commission must call on the Member States to urgently review the level of their penalties in this area. The wilful and negligent handling of food and feed must not be punished with trivial penalties. Often, the fine is so low compared with the profit that it is paid out of the petty cash. It is also extremely important to increase the number of state inspectors. The current example in Germany demonstrates very well that the principle of self-checking has major shortcomings. I would like to point out that the polluter pays principle needs to be applied consistently throughout the whole chain – from trough to table. After all, the safety of our food begins with what we feed to our animals. Innocent people should not have to suffer the consequences of the criminal behaviour of others. As yet, it is not clear who will pay for the losses suffered by farmers as a result of the dioxin scandal. One thing is certain: it will not be the polluters that have gone bankrupt, as there is absolutely no money left there. This is unacceptable. In this regard, a European fund should be considered that all feedstuff manufacturers would have to pay into. The problems that keep occurring in connection with food safety continue to make one thing clear: for the whole process chain, for both food as well as feed, we need to ensure complete traceability. The EU regulation and national legislation need to be improved in this regard. Ulrike Rodust  (S&amp;D

 Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, as coordinator for the Committee on Fisheries, I find the fisheries aspect of this interim agreement particularly interesting. In this regard, there were a few controversial issues at the start with regard to the relaxation of the rules of origin for Papua New Guinea. I support the Commission’s idea of using this relaxation to stimulate the economy of one of the poorest countries in the world. I am convinced that this is also something that should be of concern to those of us involved in fisheries policy. At the same time, I can understand the concerns of the European industry, but I cannot honestly imagine that the relaxations granted will lead to Papua New Guinea becoming a serious competitor of our canning industry. However, we need to be vigilant, because it will clearly not help anyone if we relocate half our canning industry to the Pacific region. In this regard, I have to say, however, that during the debate on this agreement, we have been presented with very contradictory information regarding the question of the extent to which investments are being made in Papua New Guinea and which states are profiting indirectly from the relaxation of the rules of origin. I would therefore urgently call on the Commission to closely monitor the application of this derogation and to submit a report to Parliament in a timely manner on the impact on Papua New Guinea’s development and on the European canning industry. If this arrangement does not have the desired effect in Papua New Guinea and entails unacceptable losses for European companies, we will have to make a different decision when we come to negotiate the final agreement. Please keep us informed of developments. Ulrike Rodust  (S&amp;D

 Mr President, Commissioner, at this point, I would like once again to point out that a decision has already been made to ban the practice of battery farming in cages. The Member States and the egg producers have had plenty of time to implement the directive for the abandonment of conventional battery practices. The time has not run out quite yet – there are still twelve months to go before the practice is to be completely banned. I believe that we must ensure that battery farming is completely banned by 1 January 2012. It must be possible to threaten the Member States who have not succeeded in implementing the directive by then with legal action, such as financial penalties. We also need to ensure that eggs which originate from farming practices that do not comply with European law are not sold in the internal European market. Ulrike Rodust  (S&amp;D

 I would like to draw the attention of the Council to a problem which is threatening to paralyse the cooperation between the two institutions on the subject of fisheries policy. This is about the regulations for long-term management plans. These regulations lie at the heart of the common fisheries policy. The Council and a majority of the Member States do not accept that the Treaty of Lisbon has given the European Parliament the right of codecision on these regulations. The ministers are acting in opposition to the Council and the Council’s legal service, in opposition to the opinion of the Commission and in opposition, of course, to the will of the European Parliament. The Council currently has two management plans which cannot be adopted. The Commission cannot submit further plans, which are urgently needed in the interests of our fishermen and our seas and which have long since been completed and are lying in a drawer. This situation is unacceptable. I am calling on the Belgian Presidency and the future Hungarian Presidency to start negotiations with Parliament immediately, so that we can find a solution. We are ready to begin discussions. Thank you very much. Ulrike Rodust  (S&amp;D

 Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, I support the compromise reached for the resolution. As coordinator for the Group of the Progressive Alliance of Socialists and Democrats in the European Parliament in the Committee on Fisheries, I am also interested in the fisheries agreement with Morocco. It is good that we are calling for the resolution for international law to be respected in connection with the exploitation of resources in Western Sahara. Unfortunately, most Members of this House are not aware that there is an opinion issued by Parliament’s legal service which states that the current fisheries agreement with Morocco contravenes international law if it is not demonstrated that the people of Western Sahara benefit from the agreement. There is currently no demonstration of this and the European Commission has therefore put negotiations concerning renewal of the agreement on hold. I very much hope that a diplomatic solution can be found here. However, it has to be clear to us that we cannot ignore international law on account of economic interests. Ulrike Rodust  (S&amp;D

 Madam President, Mr Cioloş, ladies and gentlemen, bees play a decisive role in our ecosystem. On the one hand, they are important for the preservation of biodiversity and, on the other, biodiversity is important for the preservation of the bees, not only because this is the International Year of Biodiversity, but also because they contribute to our own survival. As part of the reform of the common agricultural policy, we should focus, among other things, on preventing monocultures and increasing the use of wide crop rotation. I do not want to talk about plant protection products and pesticides today. I think that it is important to promote and develop research in this area and to improve the coordination between different research projects in the individual Member States in order to ensure that we have healthy bees. Whatever happens, we should continue to support the beekeeping sector beyond 2013 and also make sure that in future, we have both enough bees and enough beekeepers to care for them.

 Mr President, Mrs Damanaki, I am very pleased that this week, we are able to adopt four important regulations on fisheries policy, and that we have been able to reach agreement among ourselves as well as with the Council and Commission on the reports concerning aquaculture and technical measures in the Baltic Sea. Unfortunately, the same cannot be said for the two regulations on long-term management plans. The right formula for management of sardine stocks has always been subject to considerable argument among the committee. I believe that the submission to plenary looks very good and I am pleased that it seems that the Group of the European People’s Party (Christian Democrats) has also now realised this, as it has tabled no more amendments. I assume that you will be voting in favour tomorrow. We have a much more serious problem where the Council is concerned, however. Contrary to the advice of their own legal experts, the majority of the Member States are refusing to accept the European Parliament’s right of codecision – a full year after the entry into force of the Treaty of Lisbon! I consider that outrageous. I have therefore suggested to the chair of our committee that a joint letter be written to the European fisheries ministers. I would be pleased if we could reach agreement in the coming days so that together, we can demonstrate how determined Parliament is. We will not allow ourselves to be fobbed off by the Council so easily. Ulrike Rodust,

 Mr President, Commissioner Damanaki, ladies and gentlemen, I am pleased that we are able to adopt a regulation that represents one more small step towards our shared goal of sustainable fisheries. The regional fisheries organisations are extraordinarily important institutions for good management worldwide. Unfortunately, the negotiations are often difficult and progress much too slow for impatient people such as me. We must therefore do all we can to strengthen the regional fisheries organisations. I will now comment on the specific outcome of the NEAFC report. I believe that the new port state control ruling in the NEAFC and the new measures to prevent illegal fisheries are very much to be welcomed. Nonetheless, we had to conduct intensive negotiations with the Council and Commission on matters that seem extremely technical at first glance, but which are important for our future work. I think we have found a compromise that is acceptable to all parties in the matter of delegated acts. We also succeeded in reaching agreement on how future NEAFC decisions are to be transposed into EU law. It is no secret, however, that the Commission is not very happy with the result achieved here. I can understand that. We cannot allow it to take years for the European Union to implement NEAFC decisions. In this respect, Council and Parliament must together prove that we are able to conclude a codecision procedure quickly where necessary. Finally, I would like to say something about a matter that is very current: the dispute with Iceland over mackerel fishing. We already have the NEAFC, which governs the international waters of the North-East Atlantic. In the case of migratory species such as mackerel, however, we also need an agreement that applies in territorial waters. As you know, that is still a sticking point. I feel it is extremely regrettable that, despite the cooperation working in the main, there is so much dispute over this. How about giving the regional fisheries organisations authority for coastal waters – at least for migratory species? It would be a radical step, of course, but undoubtedly one worth considering.

 Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, we should vote in favour of this report on the animal experiments directive. In its negotiations with the Commission and the Council, Parliament has achieved a great deal: namely replacement, reduction and refinement. It is true that from an animal welfare perspective, we are still doing too little. However, the Council was not prepared to do more and has made it clear that there would be no new directive if we did not accept these results. This does not mean that we cannot continue to make progress in this area in future. Animal welfare and research must be given high priority in our policies. I would be very happy if we were able to stop animal experiments completely today. Unfortunately, we are a long way from achieving this goal and, therefore, we must ensure that we provide animals with as much protection as possible. The compromise that has been negotiated offers a far better foundation for doing this. The only important thing is to make sure that all the Member States implement the new directive consistently. I would like to thank the rapporteur and all the shadow rapporteurs warmly for their hard work. Ulrike Rodust  (S&amp;D

I thank the rapporteur. Many ideas from my group have been worked into the report before us, and now we have a very good result. Our primary goal must be to ensure high-quality food production in Europe. In the discussion on the organisation of agrarian reform, there was frequent talk of compensation of public goods. In my opinion, this debate goes in the right direction. Only if the citizens of the EU are convinced that efforts are really being made and money is not simply being paid out across the board will the common agricultural policy get the recognition that it deserves. The development of rural areas plays an ever greater role. In order to prevent the obliteration and desertification of our agriculture, we must develop further instruments that will stop the rural exodus. Active rural areas are an attractive living environment not just for farmers, but also for people who do not want to live in cities. We should approve the report as it stands with a large majority in plenary in order to send a clear outward signal. Ulrike Rodust  (S&amp;D

 Mr President, Mrs Damanaki, European fisheries policy is facing enormous challenges. Our fishermen have to cope with diminishing stocks and at the same time have to deal with competition on the global market that is not always fair. We urgently need to introduce radical reforms in order to put an end to overfishing in European waters and to ensure the survival of European fisheries. I agree with Commissioner Damanaki that we should not ask too much of our fishermen by on the one hand demanding that they make radical reforms while on the other liberalising trade. Doing both of these things at the same time will place too high a burden on our fishermen. The best way to increase competitiveness is to allow fish stocks to recover. Another way to enable European fisheries to survive would be through better marketing. Under certain circumstances, European consumers are prepared to pay more for European fish if they are better informed about its origin. Ulrike Rodust  (S&amp;D

 Mr President, I have not asked for the floor to raise a point of order, but I would like to ask you, Mr President, and my fellow Members to be aware of the following: there is a problem with the translation here. I have tabled an amendment to the Lyon report, recital Ae: ‘whereas the CAP must be geared to the maintenance and development of multifunctional, sustainable agriculture throughout Europe.’ Unfortunately, the word ‘extensive’ has been used in the translations. However, the word ‘flächendeckend’ in the German translation has a completely different meaning. It means ‘in all of the regions of Europe’. There should be agriculture (‘flächendeckend’ agriculture) even throughout mountainous regions. ‘Extensive’ means something entirely different. Ulrike Rodust  (S&amp;D

Madam President, I would like to thank Mrs Damanaki and Mr Oettinger. Their words give us hope. Although the Gulf of Mexico is a long way away, the disaster may affect our animal life too, fish in particular. If the oil from the Gulf is driven into the open Atlantic, it could affect the spawning grounds of the European eel, for example, which was already threatened with extinction prior to the oil catastrophe. This is not a natural event, but rather an unbelievable disaster triggered by human error. For this reason, we must do all we can to ensure something like this never happens again. We are responsible for the safety of European oil platforms. We need to put our laws to the test because European environmental liability provisions are not enforceable in the event of oil catastrophes on the high seas. There are over 400 oil platforms in the North Sea alone. In view of the fact that the European Union has 320 000 km of maritime coast, it is essential that we should move away from oil and towards a future based on renewable energies. I call on the Commission to propose concrete solutions and to act quickly. Ulrike Rodust  (S&amp;D

 Madam President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, the so-called compromise proposal that will be tabled next week in Agadir is, in my view, completely unacceptable. A resumption of commercial whaling is something that the majority of the European public will not understand. I call on the Commission and the Member States to speak out at the meeting in Morocco against the reintroduction of commercial whaling. Of course, on paper the compromise does not, at first sight, look so bad. Its supporters say that it will permit even fewer whales to be hunted than is currently the case. The compromise proposal provides for the introduction of quotas. Let me tell you something from my own experience of quotas in fisheries policy. Quotas, particularly when they apply worldwide, are systematically circumvented. Just look at bluefin tuna. Here quotas are laid down year after year that are systematically exceeded many times over. There is another reason why the European Union should oppose this compromise. It provides for quotas only for those countries that currently – and I would say ‘semi-legally’ – carry out whaling. That would reward the systematic violation of the rules. We should not accept this under any circumstances. Supporters of whaling are hard-nosed in their methods. Japan has allegedly even collected votes from poorer Member States. That is yet another reason why the European Union needs to be united in its rejection of the reintroduction of commercial whaling.

 Madam President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, firstly, I would like to offer my sincere thanks to my fellow Member Mr Milana, who has managed to produce a first-class report. In view of the dramatic overfishing of our seas and the continually growing demand for fish products, alternatives to wild catches are needed now more than ever. However, aquaculture is only an alternative if ecological interests do not get ignored. For me, ecologically-sound aquaculture means, for example, that efforts need to be made to reduce the proportion of fish meal in the feed. Ultimately, we will help our seas very little if we catch 4 kilograms of wild fish in order to produce 1 kilogram of farmed fish. It is also important to avoid a negative impact on surrounding waters. In this regard, much needs to be done in the area of research. At the same time, we must ensure that fish farming does not degenerate into a form of animal cruelty as a result of high stocking densities. In this regard, I would particularly like to stress the fact that we urgently need to establish a maritime development plan. The coexistence of different interests such as aquaculture, fisheries, tourism and, not least, nature conservation must be organised well. All of this has been admirably expressed in our report. Incidentally, a stronger European aquaculture is also valuable from the point of view of employment policy, as it can create jobs in our often disadvantaged coastal regions. Ulrike Rodust  (S&amp;D
).

 Mr President, the catch documentation programme adopted by the International Commission for the Conservation of Atlantic Tunas (ICCAT) and confirmed by us today is a step in the right direction, but it comes too late. It must not be the case that we only take drastic measures once stocks of a threatened species are decimated to 6%. Illegal fishing is a particular problem here. I still very much regret the fact that the European Union did not succeed in obtaining a better outcome in the CITES negotiation. The ICCAT and other regional fisheries organisations must act with more foresight in future. It is therefore important that we as the European Parliament get more involved in these bodies to counterbalance the short-sighted national interests. The public interest in the sustainable management of fish stocks is becoming ever greater. It is important to convert this into a responsible policy. Mrs Damanaki, I can assure you that the Group of the Progressive Alliance of Socialists and Democrats in the European Parliament will support you in any activity that helps to maintain bluefin tuna stocks and to safeguard the livelihoods of the fishermen.

 Mr President, Mr Cioloş, I have in front of me an analysis of the economic situation in the German agricultural sector. The analysis involved the evaluation of 19 100 sets of accounts from full-time and part-time farms. The results have been projected on the basis of the distribution of farms from the Farm Structure Survey of 2007. In the financial year 2008-2009, the overall situation deteriorated significantly. The figures for the 18 200 full-time dairy and arable farms fell from EUR 45 400 to EUR 34 400. That represents a reduction of 24%. Particularly large losses occurred in 2008-2009. Operating results fell to EUR 29 300 (minus 45%) and to EUR 43 000 (minus 18%). In contrast, mixed livestock farms … (The President cut off the speaker) Ulrike Rodust  (S&amp;D

 Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, a warm welcome to all the fishermen and -women in the Chamber! Today’s vote represents a milestone for the European Parliament. For the first time since the ratification of the Treaty of Lisbon, we have the opportunity to express our opinions on the reform of the common fisheries policy (CFP). In the next few years, our power and our responsibilities will increase significantly. This report is acceptable and I would like to thank Mrs Patrão Neves and Mrs Andrés Barea for their hard work. We have succeeded in incorporating important social democratic concerns into the report. These include specific support for small-scale fisheries. Those affected will now be included in the decision-making process. Support must be given in particular to small family businesses. Their presence in the coastal regions not only provides jobs, but also increases the attractiveness of many of these regions for tourists. Some parts of this report still need improvement and we have tabled amendments for that purpose. We social democrats want to make it clear that one of the central problems is the outstanding overcapacity. It is a fact that environmental sustainability is a fundamental prerequisite for the economic survival of fishermen. Therefore, the environment must take priority. A third important point concerns the external aspects of the CFP and the partnership agreements with third countries. We move that paragraph 121, which puts undue emphasis on the interests of European fisheries, should be deleted. We should behave outside European waters in just the same way as we do at home. This means promoting sustainability, human rights and democracy throughout the world and ensuring that the income from partnership agreements does not disappear into the coffers of corrupt dictatorships. Finally, I would like to make one more fundamental point. European fisheries policy is a hot potato, because it involves so many powerful national interests. It will come as no surprise that these have led to heated debates within the groups in recent weeks. Fortunately, we have all succeeded in finding effective compromises. However, when it comes to the legislative process, we must focus more closely on this issue than we have today and come up with some common European solutions. We must leave the trivial problems of national greed to the Council. Ulrike Rodust  (S&amp;D

 Madam President, Commissioner, Council, I would like to begin by thanking my fellow Member Mr Capoulas Santos, who has made this resolution possible. Today we are talking about our dairy farmers and whether we are going to leave them in the lurch or deal with them in an honest manner. I do not believe that we should leave them in the lurch, but should be honest in our dealings with them. Yes, short-term measures to overcome the crisis are urgently needed. Yes, intervention is perfectly acceptable for a short period if the price of milk has reached rock bottom, and additional subsidies, loans and funds to combat the crisis are justified. However, what is totally unacceptable is, firstly, to start up discussions about milk quotas again and, secondly, to reintroduce tax-funded export refunds for products supplied to developing countries. We abandoned this one way street in 2003 and I appeal to you to keep it that way for the sake of our dairy farmers.Barbara Weiler  (S&amp;D

Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, the single market has become a matter of course for our citizens. Who can fail to remember with amusement the judgment of 1979 on Cassis de Dijon or the banana war with the United States? As we look at global trade wars or disputes, the European single market appears as a mainstay of the European philosophy: no barriers, no discrimination, legal certainty and fair competition.  Nevertheless, in the interplay between the global economic powers we, the European Union, must continue to safeguard the rights of consumers and SMEs and protect consumers against new dangers, for example, chemical substances or new, creative tricks by vendors, such as exist in the financial market. We social democrats support the Commission in its measures against dominant practices and unfair competition, regardless of who is involved, even when this applies to Microsoft or Google, to German energy companies or Gazprom. We must also observe Jacques Delors’s third point more closely: the single market also means solidarity, which unites. Barbara Weiler  (S&amp;D

 Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, I would like to thank the rapporteur and, above all, the whole team of shadow rapporteurs, for producing these proposals, which we will adopt tomorrow. Much has already been said about the benefits of standards. I would like to mention two further examples that we think are self-evident: the universal charger for mobile phones and, in future, the realisation of electromobility. Without standards, these things would absolutely not be possible. Unfortunately, not all of society knows how standards are produced. It is not this House – and nor will it be in future – it is national, European and international institutes like CEN and CENELEC that produce standards. The last 25 years has been a good period, but there were also a number of shortcomings, which we have now tidied up. The creation of standards was far too slow, far too expensive, too opaque and too unilateral in terms of participation. We have now rectified that with this proposal, and we will make access cheaper for small and medium-sized enterprises, too, we will involve the trade unions and the social partners, the consumer organisations, and we will link up with national, international and European bodies. I am also pleased about the sensible involvement in procurement. As a final point, I will deal with acceptance. This is something that we will still have to test out and check the state thereof. Germany’s DIN institute had serious concerns at the start of the debate about the direction that acceptance was moving in. I believe those concerns have since been resolved. The SME sector in Hesse, for example, has already provided me with feedback. I found out that it is pleased with this compromise, with this proposal from the rapporteur and the Committee on the Internal Market and Consumer Protection, and that it sees a series of improvements for the future.

 Madam President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, in the past week, I had the honour of speaking about the 20th anniversary of the completion of the internal market at a Franco-German partnership celebration. It was interesting to see how the guests reacted to this. They took it all for granted, and indeed it is good that citizens consider this something that goes without saying. The four fundamental freedoms are the core of the European Union, and I hope that we, as Parliament, will fight all joint attempts to erect new barriers and new borders, such as when the German Government and the former French Government attempted to erect new barriers, because the freedom of movement of our citizens is at least as important to us as the freedom of movement of capital or goods. In my view, Mr Busuttil has presented a good and helpful report. The internal market scoreboard, SOLVIT and other instruments are useful for establishing whether the governments really want European laws and whether the deficits are actually being reduced, as the Council has in fact agreed. We want the internal market to be simplified for consumers. We want SMEs to have easier access and we want all our citizens to profit from it. Interestingly, transposition is not always related to the size of the country. As has already been mentioned, Malta comes out best; Belgium, unfortunately, has not done so well. Mr Busuttil, your motion is also interesting and I have great sympathy for you, but I must point out that there are a few other demands in your report that already incorporate this, such as Article 18 on transparency, or Article 24, in which we call for correlation tables, or even Article 21, which suggests that the European Court of Justice could work more quickly. So perhaps we should work on this first. On behalf of the Group of the Progressive Alliance of Socialists and Democrats in the European Parliament, I should like to highlight four further aspects. Firstly, the transposition must be correct; that is, it does not have to be gold-plated, but it must not be lax and inadequate. Mr Chatzimarkakis, if I may have your ear for a moment: the two liberal camps in the national German Government are currently dabbling with the Payment Services Directive, and from what I have heard, initial reports are not encouraging. Now for my second point, which is that the internal market is also a way of overcoming the crisis, creates jobs and contributes to growth. Thirdly, we consider the procedures for the social protection of workers to be too cumbersome, because as far as we are concerned – and this is my only criticism, Commissioner Barnier – social cohesion is dealt with too briefly in this report. We will insist on this, because we have a long tradition of social cohesion. Finally, I would like to quote your former colleague, Jacques Delors, who said that the internal market works according to three principles: competition which stimulates, cooperation which strengthens and solidarity which unites.

 Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I would like to talk about the European Development Fund (EDF), and I am confident that we will be able to reach agreement in this area, not only in committee, but also in plenary. This debate – and this is surely also important to mention – is taking place under the very particular circumstances of the hard times of economic and financial crisis within the European Union and, essentially, also worldwide. That is precisely why the attention of the general public is also on our debate here concerning discharge and the review of the budget. After all, we all actually want the budget to be correctly implemented and for it to be meaningful and, above all – I mention this with regard to the EDF in particular – sustainable, too. The EDF is our most important instrument for reducing poverty, that is to say, in the best interests of the European Union, for preventing wars and also for giving people prospects for the future. I am absolutely convinced that that is also the way the citizens and taxpayers see it. The Social Democrats support the report that we voted on in committee, although this was only after our amendments had been adopted and the report took a slightly different direction, as meaningful and necessary criticism is only right and proper. However, as Ms Herczog already mentioned, an attempt at politicisation is being made here, for example, with regard to the criticism of the United Nations. It goes without saying that the UN must improve its efficiency and, in particular, become more transparent. However, it is also an important partner for our work and it has useful infrastructure. We must, in any case, provide training in our offices and increase capacity, as that is the only way to work efficiently. That is something I would like to emphasise and, to conclude, I would like to state that we need a common assessment of the error rate and, of course, also a different agricultural policy.

 Mr President, Baroness Ashton, ladies and gentlemen, Ms Oomen-Ruijten, your speech has made it clear to me that the Members who recently visited Myanmar together with me and Mr Langen as part of a delegation from the Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN) have a rather different view. It is no longer possible to say that the regime is still a junta. There are moves under way towards democracy that we have experienced at first hand and seen the effects of. I believe that everyone who has been involved in the introduction of democracy on the ground in Myanmar has been impressed, relieved and filled with enthusiasm. In my opinion, this is particularly true in the light of the debate that we have just held and the developments in Syria, Mali and Egypt. What can the EU do to ensure that this process continues in Myanmar? Sympathy alone is not enough. We need to share responsibility for further development aid projects and give them our support. We should encourage the ASEAN countries and, in particular, Myanmar’s neighbour, Thailand, to continue helping, as they have already done for a long period. However, we also need to lift the sanctions. The following comment recently appeared in a newspaper: Myanmar is a gold mine with huge quantities of raw materials, gas and oil, and all of this is now available. The estimate is that growth will reach a level of 6%. We must also help to ensure – not alone, but the EU is partly responsible for this – that the growth and the wealth in what is still, in part, a very poor country does not end up in the capitals of America, Europe and China, but reaches the population. Only then will there be stable, peaceful and democratic long-term development in the country. Barbara Weiler,

 Mr President, Commissioners, ladies and gentlemen, Malaysia is a wonderful country with age-old traditions and cultural riches. As members of the ASEAN delegation, we have frequently seen for ourselves how quickly and remarkably this country has grown. The resulting increase in economic power has led to Malaysia achieving top ten ranking when it comes to world growth rates, a fact that has greatly impressed us. It is for this reason that I would like to state on behalf of my own group, the Group of the Progressive Alliance of Socialists and Democrats in the European Parliament, as well as all those here who signed the resolution, that we find it impossible to understand why Malaysia still practises this outmoded method of chastisement, which harkens back to the country’s colonial past and which seems almost mediaeval to us in Europe. We are not alone in voicing this criticism: lawyers in Malaysia itself are equally opposed to the practice. Caning violates all United Nations human rights agreements and we believe that things need to change quickly. We welcomed the charter of the ASEAN states, which emphasises in several articles and the preamble that – and I quote – ‘the promotion and protection of human rights’ is among the essential requirements of the ASEAN Charter, which has also been ratified by Malaysia. Malaysia has long espoused democratic principles. However, this also involves the rule of law with universal standards. This is something we shall repeat again and again when we are in Malaysia and the ASEAN states, and the European Parliament will underline this with this resolution. Barbara Weiler,

 Madam President, President-in-Office of the Council, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, first of all, I would like to thank the team of shadow rapporteurs from the Committee on Legal Affairs and the Committee on Industry, Research and Energy, my colleagues and everyone who contributed to this splendid result. Without constructive and fair cooperation with the Commission and with the Belgian Presidency, we would certainly not have achieved this result. As rapporteur, I am – as you can imagine – very pleased with the result, firstly because we have made significant improvements in relation to the old directive, and secondly because we have introduced new ways to encourage better payment practices. We have achieved the goal. Well, I would prefer to say that the course has been set for improving the liquidity of SMEs, the small and medium-sized enterprises, and for securing investments in new products, new jobs and new processes. Why was it necessary to improve this directive? The legislation from 2000 was non-binding and not very efficient. In recent years, payment practices in almost all Member States have deteriorated, and this happened even before the financial and economic crisis. The reform was also requested by the small businesses that expressed their wishes within the framework of the Small Business Act. They wanted payment practices in Europe to be organised in a considerably more efficient manner. With regard to the results, I can say, firstly, that we have trodden a new path. We have strict rules. As a matter of principle, invoices must be paid within 30 days with few exceptions, and these must be justified. We have introduced a higher late payment interest rate of 8%. We have set the recovery costs at a completely non-bureaucratic fixed amount of EUR 40, and we have made it easier than it was previously for small businesses to assert their rights. The second aspect to the new path, however, is the positive incentives and the new instruments, for example, the naming of customers with good payment practices, more information provided to small businesses concerning their rights, payment in instalments and the promotion of alternative dispute resolution mechanisms. This legislation is also part of the ‘better regulation’ approach and it will also apply to the EU institutions. We are particularly proud of this, because – as I am sure you can imagine – not everyone was enthusiastic about it. Of course, there were a few conflicts and I would like to mention some of these. Firstly, to start with, there were certainly major differences and a diversity of opinions in Parliament. The 100 amendments alone demonstrate that we first had to tussle together over this in Parliament, too. The Commission was certainly not always happy with our endeavours, including the extension of this to the business to business level, but I think that, overall, we have achieved a good result. It was the Council that posed the problems. It is regrettable that the Council has not always fulfilled its objective of helping small businesses. I find that particularly regrettable for the relatively rich and well-structured countries like Germany and Austria. With regard to the professional organisations, I can only say that they were constructive, even though we, naturally, did not always accept or were not always able to go with their opinions. In summary, the next steps are that, after tomorrow’s vote, we expect the Council to conduct a final positive vote and then the Member States will be able to implement this legislation. We do not expect it to take two years for this to be implemented. Instead, we expect the Member States to begin to transpose it into national law as early as January of next year. Barbara Weiler,  
rapporteur.

Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, when we discuss this matter back home in our electoral districts, I believe we will all find that we receive a great deal of support – something that is not a foregone conclusion where European dossiers are concerned – because this issue of late payment as a whole is not merely criticised back home; it is considered by everyone to be a given that payments should be made on time. That is the case irrespective of which party someone belongs to, and it is not dependent on what branch of industry you talk to, either. So we have broad agreement. I would also like to thank my fellow Members who have indicated their agreement with this result this evening. I would like to mention three more aspects. As I said at the beginning of the debate, we will set the wheels in motion tomorrow. However, we will have to look very closely at whether the relaxations that we have introduced for micro-businesses, for agricultural undertakings, for example, and for artisan companies, are actually sufficient to enable these enterprises to obtain the money they are owed. We will have to examine very carefully how the limited freedom of contract will work. That is something new in the European internal market that we are now going to try out and that all of us also more or less support. We will need to examine whether the 8% late payment interest rate is adequate; Parliament would have liked it to be 9%. We will see how it works, and I would like to ask the Commission to pay close attention in order to ensure that, during the process of implementation, the Member States do not water down the directive. I also see definite success on the horizon. I have heard that Spain has already produced new national legislation following our methods, and I know that the same is true of other Member States. In any case, our Committee will monitor the situation or carry out an impact assessment according to a directive, so that the Member States also know that, when the parliamentary term comes to an end, we will know who has implemented the improved payment practices as we intended and who has not. I would like to thank everyone who has contributed to this result, including the Belgian Presidency, which has perhaps not received enough recognition for its contribution. We know how efficiently and constructively you conducted the negotiations – a small country, but I would say a country with very intelligent and efficient methods for achieving results in Europe.

 Mr President, representatives of the Commission and, above all, the Council, ladies and gentlemen, we hear this every year in the debate on improvements in the implementation of the distribution of European funds: more accurate and more efficient control of expenditure in all bodies and institutions, more transparency for Parliament and also for citizens. The presence today of the Council is the first indication that something is changing in the Council as well. Marvellous, we are pleased – as you have heard – but that is certainly not enough for us. It is precisely the difference that you mentioned – you believe you have created complete transparency, while we believe you have not yet answered our questions from the debate at the end of November – that shows that we are not yet cooperating with each other as well as we should be. You spoke of the 1970 agreement that you want to amend and develop. That is all well and good, but this expectation of ours is hardly new. We have mentioned it a few times and now you have acted as if it were a new thing entirely. The Group of the Progressive Alliance of Socialists and Democrats will support Mr Czarnecki’s report. We share his criticism and that of the other groups. We will not grant discharge to the Council, either today or next month. I am therefore surprised by the request by Mrs Andreasen, since I obviously believe that the Member States are responsible for 80% of the funds. That does not exempt the Council from its responsibilities, since the Council is not a fourth or fifth institution in the EU, but works together with the Member States. However, our criticism, I agree, has no real consequences. As Mr Audy has pointed out, we must develop our tools. Every year, we show the Council the yellow card of discharge refusal and nothing happens. We must therefore develop our tools: not only tangible criticism, but also consequences – what happens if the Council does not work with us. That will possibly also mean constitutional change.

 Mr President, Commissioners, ladies and gentlemen, this joint debate this morning and the high quality of all three reports indicates the high priority given to internal market and consumer policy in Europe. I would like to thank all three rapporteurs and the many shadow rapporteurs and fellow Members who have produced this joint work. I would like to focus on two crucial points. The first is that we, that is, the Commission and those of us in this House, are assuming that everything runs relatively harmoniously in the internal market and that we have enlightened consumers and fair suppliers. That is often the case, but not always. There are irresponsible suppliers who only see their short-term profits and therefore, we need stronger market surveillance and supervision. However, there are also uninformed consumers. We need better information. It is not enough for the package leaflet to be readable. We need continuous information. Someone has just said that we need confidence. However, confidence comes from knowledge. I have heard that in Germany, only one in two 14 to 15 year olds understands the meaning of inflation. I do not even want to ask what the results of the questionnaire were when it came to the word ‘deflation’. We need schools to be better networked along with information on the conflict between the interests of suppliers and consumers. That is mentioned in the reports by my fellow Members ...

 Mr President, Commissioner, Mr Caldeira, ladies and gentlemen, I would like to start by thanking Mr Caldeira and his team. His report will be very useful to us in our deliberations which lead up to the granting of a discharge. I have a sense of déjà vu, because as far as I can tell, the Council is once again conspicuous by its absence, just as it was last year. I am being so critical because the Council, as one of our major community institutions, cannot and should not stand outside this debate. We rightly expect all the Member States to provide control and transparency, but we also expect this from our own institutions and the Council is jointly responsible for what happens or does not happen in the Member States. Of course, the irregularities in the budgets do not affect the Council’s budget as severely as they do the agricultural sector, but nevertheless, we will also have questions about public procurement, late payments or overdue payments and repeated overestimating. We will be discussing this with the Council in the next few weeks. It is true that errors are not the same as fraud and that the recovery of payments is a useful tool. Another good tool is the process of naming and shaming in the area of agricultural policy which has proved its worth in Bavaria and in the rest of Germany. I believe that we should continue to use this method because it has become clear that the Member States and the companies involved react to it. We expect the Swedish Presidency to be ready to discuss this over the next few days and also… (The President cut off the speaker) Bernd Lange,

Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, what are we dealing with here? We are dealing with an issue which concerns fair trade. This is not about protectionism for European products. There is one issue, and one issue alone, at stake, namely ensuring that our trade relations are based on fairness. I therefore believe that the threat scenario that China is now creating is completely inappropriate. Let me make it very clear: we want transparency in the investigations, and we do not welcome attempts by China to obstruct these investigations by creating threat scenarios, in which European companies are put under pressure with the threat of countermeasures that are supposedly in the pipeline. No, that is not part of the discussion! We intend to investigate the matter. In reality, however, it is about the following issue. Under what kind of working conditions are the solar panels produced in China? Which direct and indirect subsidies go towards supporting their production? What about the value chain as a whole? There are many different aspects which need to be investigated very carefully.  There is undoubtedly overcapacity. We cannot have a situation in which dumping is used to reduce overcapacity, at the expense of European jobs and industry. That is why we need to achieve transparency here. Hence my question, and this is also addressed to the Commission: does this transparency exist on the Chinese side as well? Does the Commission have the opportunity to look at all of the relevant facts? That should have been China’s immediate reaction: instead of making threatening gestures, it should have created transparency. Secondly, are you willing to pursue this process to the end, even if China were to yield at the last moment? We do not want a situation like the ethanol case with the United States, when the procedure was shelved at the last minute! I urge you to pursue it right to the end. Bernd Lange,

Mr President, Madam President-in-Office of the Council, I would like to begin by sincerely thanking the rapporteur for what is, in my view, an excellent report which covers the many different facets of our relations with Kazakhstan in a truly outstanding manner. Thank you very much indeed.  Speaking on behalf of the Committee on International Trade, I would like to talk about four aspects which are particularly important to us. First of all, as the President-in-Office of the Council has already mentioned, Kazakhstan is seeking accession to the WTO, and that means, of course, that it must comply with and implement WTO rules. It will also be subject to the WTO’s dispute settlement regime. This is an important step towards transparency and fairness.  Secondly, when we talk about transparency and fairness, raw materials are, of course, an issue of great relevance in this context. Kazakhstan’s economy is geared mainly towards the raw materials sector, so the main priority here is to create workable tax and financial frameworks, but without losing sight of the environmental dimension. The aim must be to ensure that raw materials extraction serves the interests of the people of Kazakhstan but also safeguards the interests of the environment. Thirdly, this includes the issue of phosphorus, for example. We cannot have a situation in which the export of phosphorus involves the use of dumping practices, ultimately putting a question mark over well-established structures in the European Union. We support trade, but it must take place under conditions which are fair and reasonable. Fourthly, as in all the trade agreements concluded by the EU, trade also means fair conditions of competition in the fields of workers’ rights and environmental standards. For that reason, we also need to include a sound and viable chapter on sustainable development in the agreement. We want this demand to be reflected in the resolution; that is our firm position. Bernd Lange  (S&amp;D
). 
 – (DE) 
Mr President, Commissioner, I think you are being too defensive if you only examine how the consequences of plant closures and overcapacity can be remedied. No, I believe we need to examine how corporate policy can be shaped in a sensible way. The lesson is firstly that we need different forms of corporate governance. We need employees to be more involved in their companies so that sensible solutions can be found for the future of firms. This is one of the central lessons learned from the crisis: greater worker participation in companies to enable sensible solutions to be found. Secondly, Commissioner, we in fact have 15 factories in the European Union that are running at around 50 % capacity. When I look at the global market, however, Commissioner, car production is growing from roughly 79 million to 84 million. Something is wrong here! It is unacceptable that we are de-industrialising here, while, on the other hand, the global automotive market is growing by 3 % a year. No, we do not need to just close down car factories, we need investments in future technologies to ensure that the automotive industry remains in Europe and is competitive on the global market. This also means that global corporations must be urged to exercise restraint, as they also make global investment decisions and do not necessarily place a particular emphasis on European interests. A more active role is therefore required from the European Commission! Bernd Lange,

Mr President, Commissioner, yes, we support you in your efforts to bolster the European steel industry. I also think it is right that trends that are also in evidence in the steel industry, namely simply reducing capacities, are not followed. Just recently I read an article in the press by the President of the European steel industry body that said that 100 000 of the close to 400 000 jobs in the industry would have to be cut, that we had to shed 25 % of capacity – a hard, deep cut. No, we cannot deal with the problem like this. We must make sure that we stabilise this core industry in the European Union and create prospects for development. This of course was a foundation stone on which the European Union was built. I would like to bring to mind the European Coal and Steel Community, which very successfully developed a research and structural policy for the steel sector. I believe that there should continue to be such a model; work on the further development of the European steel industry should involve three equally represented groups – the Commission, employers and employees.  What we really need are innovations to ensure we have highly flexible steel at our disposal, particularly for the energy transition, an area in which there is undoubtedly demand. We must also ensure that the steel industry can exist in a competitive environment and is not unduly burdened with costs. You therefore have our support to stabilise the European steel industry.

Madam President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, this agreement must indeed be scrutinised very carefully for it has major political implications. In Israel, there is a debate under way as to whether, with this agreement, we mean to support Israel or show it the red card. In my view, this is an unproductive debate. It is not for us to adopt a position on the State of Israel and its people. Our task is simply to adopt a position towards the present Israeli Government.  When we conclude agreements with other countries, it is only right and proper that we apply the standards and values that we uphold in the European Union to our partner countries as well. With that in mind, it must be said that the present Israeli Government, in its conduct towards the Occupied Territories and the people who live there, is not acting in accordance with the values to which the European Union is committed. That is why we cannot enter into an agreement with that government without giving the matter careful thought. Secondly, there is still a lack of clarity on a number of points. The previous speaker said that there was a consensus here. No, there is no consensus. The vote in committee was 13 to 15. In my view, the origin of generic drugs is an issue that must be clarified in future in order to ensure that they do not come from the Occupied Territories or from illegal settlements. We must also clarify how the Commission will in future exercise the right to extend this agreement to other products as well. That is why we need more time for a thorough-going discussion and why I fully support Véronique De Keyser’s demand for this matter to referred back to committee for intensive deliberation.

 Our values apply on an universal basis, of course. We make no distinction at all. Why you adopted the position you did two years ago is not something that I can explain. From our perspective, the situation is quite clear: we are not pulling arguments out of thin air. We want to ensure that the agreement, which will, after all, serve as a model for future agreements as well, is sound. That is the reason why we are asking for more time to discuss it, Mr Caspary.

 Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I move to defer the vote on the legislative declaration and to refer it back to committee, so that we can enter into trialogue. Bernd Lange,  
on behalf of the S&amp;D Group
. – (DE) 
Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, when negotiating the Economic Partnership Agreements (EPAs), we must always remember that we are entering the negotiations with different requirements. We have the European Union on one side with a strong Commissioner and a large team of officials, sitting across the negotiating table from young countries with little capacity. To this extent it is more than right and proper to allow these countries more time and opportunity for negotiations. We should not give the impression that we are putting pressure on these countries by abruptly ending market access opportunities. I also believe that we should not force anyone to sign something but rather that, in a spirit of partnership, we should negotiate solutions with these countries that are acceptable to both sides. Sometimes this requires a bit more time. That is why the Group of the Progressive Alliance of Socialists and Democrats in the European Parliament clearly supports the proposal from Mr Martin to give this two years, but no more than two years, in order to identify ways in which we can reach agreement. Mr Fjellner, I would ask you to support this compromise, because we have succeeded in obtaining a sizeable majority in committee in favour of sending clear signals that this should be brought to a close, while at the same time offering opportunities for negotiations.

Mr President, Commissioner, Mr Kariņš, I should like to start by extending the warmest of thanks to the rapporteur, Mr Kariņš, for his hard work and, above all, for his patience during negotiations. I would also like to thank you, Mr Oettinger, for your proposal. In general, you are doing your work really well in the area of energy policy. The object of my criticism, in other words the Council, is not here at present. Ladies and gentlemen, I have participated in around 50 conciliation procedures and trialogues, involving negotiations with the Council. However, in all this time, I have never witnessed anything like this before, namely that the Council has taken a heavy-handed position, seeking to blackmail Parliament by saying: take it or leave it. I have never known the Council’s chief negotiator to get up and leave a trialogue before. So, we have a contradiction to what we are constantly being told in the sermons from on high: we need more involvement from Europe. This morning we have once again discussed the fact that what we need in this crisis situation is more involvement from Europe and an agreement in relation to our core policies. Mr Oettinger, you have hit the nail on the head. Energy policy is central to the European Union, to economic growth and to a forward-looking energy policy. It is only logical, ladies and gentlemen, that we can only have a sound energy policy if we can also agree on a common external energy policy, in other words agreements with third countries. Accordingly, while I understand and sympathise with the idea that achieving the lowest standard is better than nothing, we must press for greater commitment in this legislative proposal. We want to make it mandatory for the Commission to be informed and we want the Commission to participate in negotiations. That is the least we need in order to ensure that a European external energy policy really is put into practice and that the Member States do not drag their feet as usual. We shall table these amendments tomorrow and hope that you will support them so that we can give the Council something more to work with. Commissioner, I am naturally hopeful that you are really serious about your last point, namely that there should be an examination of the Council’s behaviour in future, so that we can get a reasonable revision on track. Bernd Lange,

Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, thank you for attending this evening’s sitting, so that we can discuss this matter. This issue is clearly not of interest to everyone in plenary this evening. With these safeguard regulations we are still feeling our way somewhat in relation to the Treaty of Lisbon, because the roles of the various institutions and where certain things are regulated are still unclear. Thus we now have to incorporate a number of items in the legislation, by which I mean the ordinary legislation, that have already been included in the wording of the Treaty and in the Council’s decision, but which were in the wrong place. That is why it is good practice to take a closer look at the overall process of establishing this safety net for the agreement with Colombia and Peru. On the one hand, we are placing demands on Colombia and Peru in the agreement and now we must also see how we can define the requirements that we place on ourselves. It is also important that the safety net should remain practicable. It makes little sense to set down regulations that are never applied. This is how things were done in the past. For this reason, we should exercise the powers we have to dust down the safety net legislation so that we can apply it in a positive way. Commissioner, we are concerned about five points. The first is to see what the actual criteria are for casting a safety net. I am quite convinced that, in order to determine when something is having a detrimental effect on the market, we must also address the issue of social standards because, of course, the violation of social standards leads to dumping and can give rise to competitive advantages. Accordingly, this is one of the criteria for applying safety nets, particularly in the area of bananas. Now for my second point. If we are cautious in our approach to the Treaty of Lisbon, then we will naturally find ourselves being more and more cautious about the role of the European Parliament. It is fundamental for us that we, like all the other European institutions, should have the power to launch an investigation. My third point is that if we are serious about more transparency, then this also means that we must include civil society in our dialogue to a greater extent and that this should be institutionalised when we come to examine this agreement with Colombia and Peru. That is why I want to strengthen dialogue with civil society. We need more transparency. Commissioner, you always refer to the safeguard regulations with Korea as a template. The problem is that you have forgotten Article 11 of the agreement with Korea when it comes to the issue of the transparency of monitoring and reporting. I am referring to the requirement that a report must be presented that covers all the different angles, which is something we want to see guaranteed. The fifth issue relates to providing security for the banana producers in Europe’s regions. Bernd Lange,  
rapporteur
. – (DE) 
Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, we have a huge amount of work ahead of us in the coming three to four months. In accordance with Parliament’s decision, we are going to launch a road map for strengthening workers’ rights, human rights and environmental conditions in Colombia and Peru, while also establishing a safety net for conditions here in the European Union. Neither of these is an easy task. Hence my urgent call on you, Commissioner, to support this work in whatever way you can, particularly with regard to the road map and the involvement of the government in Peru, in order to ensure that we establish a road map for Colombia and Peru within a reasonable timeframe. I get the feeling that the message has not been fully understood there and that people are unaware of just how serious Parliament is about its conditions. Secondly, Commissioner, I would ask you to please take an active mediator role in relation to the Council in the trialogue on the safeguards, so that we can also implement the safeguard regulations in a reasonable timeframe to ensure that we have both the road map and safeguard regulation in place in good time to enable us to vote on this in November and finally put this matter to bed, in the interests of the people of Europe and the people of Colombia and Peru.

 Madam President, Mr De Gucht, ladies and gentlemen, this is a political issue on which we have to decide. We in the Group of the Progressive Alliance of Socialists and Democrats in the European Parliament have analysed the Anti-Counterfeiting Trade Agreement (ACTA) very closely and carefully, and we would like to make it clear that ACTA is not a suitable instrument for guaranteeing copyright protection and preventing counterfeiting. ACTA is the wrong instrument for this and, therefore, we in the S&amp;D Group will be voting against it. Why is that? For three reasons. Firstly, the countries which are mainly responsible for counterfeiting and disregarding copyright are not the subject of the agreement. The good have been sorted out from the bad and, in international terms, it makes absolutely no sense. Secondly, ladies and gentlemen, rules from the analogue area of counterfeiting have been transferred into the digital world and, as a result, the wrong rules are being imposed on consumers who behave differently in a digital environment. This is why we are saying that we cannot put apples and pears into a saucepan and finish up with apple sauce. The wrong things are being combined here and that is the second reason why we are opposed to ACTA. However, ladies and gentlemen, the most important reason is the third one. ACTA is putting the digital world into a straitjacket and we do not even know whether we want it, because the question of enforcing intellectual property rights on the Internet, in the digital environment, has not even been resolved within the European Union. The Commission’s presentation of its legislative proposal is overdue. How can we conclude an international agreement in this area if we have not even discussed the legislative proposal within the European Union and drafted some sensible legislation? Therefore, let us put ACTA to one side and, first of all, draw up a sensible European law. I call on the Commission to submit a legislative proposal for the European Union. (The speaker agreed to take a blue-card question under Rule 149(8)) Bernd Lange  (S&amp;D

Blue-card answer. 
– (DE) 
You are mixing up apples and pears again. Climate policy is obviously something quite different from the question of copyright protection. You know very well that 60% of all counterfeit products come from China and this is why it is genuinely necessary for the international community to enter into a dialogue with China in order to find a solution and not simply to sort out the good countries from the bad ones, Mr Fjellner. Bernd Lange,  
on behalf of the S&amp;D Group.
 – (DE)
 Mr President, Commissioner, and of course – at least virtually – President-in-Office of the Council, our resolution is essentially directed towards the Council, as the reality is that we believe – and this touches on Mr Leichtfried’s question – that we, as Parliament, should proffer our position on the issuing of a mandate before one is issued. There is a good reason for this. You have already addressed the resolutions that we have adopted with numerous questions. These resolutions did show quite clearly the two sides of the coin when it comes to trade relations with Japan. We support increased trade relations with Japan – that much is clear – as the negotiations at WTO level have ground to a halt and Japan is one of our most important trading partners in the world. Over the last year, EU exports to Japan had a total value of around EUR 49 billion, while exports from Japan to the EU came in at around EUR 69 billion – in other words, we are talking about a very important part of our economic dynamics. That being the case, we need to also strengthen this so that the inter-exchange and the growth dynamic develop further. That is right and proper. On the other side of the coin, however, when it comes to market access on the Japanese side, we actually have non-tariff barriers to trade. That, after all, is why the Commission carried out this scoping exercise, and it was only recently that we obtained the results. Once again, analysing this situation precisely is the right thing to do. No sooner do we look, for example, at the key sector that is the motor industry, than three non-tariff barriers to trade hit us right in the face. Of course there is, for one thing, an agreement at UN level about technical standards for cars, as well as for vehicle parts. Clearly, recognition of this is crucial to market access. The European Union has signed up to nearly all of these guidelines, whereas Japan has only signed up to 43. In order to also be able to supply car parts to the Japanese market with unfettered access, it is actually a basic prerequisite that Japan, too, should sign up to these UN conventions. If I consider, now, the tax breaks enjoyed by environmentally friendly vehicles, I can see that, in Japan, these depend solely on test cycle JC08. Logic dictates, however, that this cycle is not adhered to by vehicles that we produce here, as we test according to a different cycle, the European driving cycle. It needs to be ensured that the same tax benefits for environmentally friendly vehicles – we define these as vehicles emitting below 90 grams of CO2
 per kilometre – are ensured for European vehicles in Japan, too, without jeopardising the standard by so doing. Of course, traders must also have the opportunity to offer their cars for sale in Japan, and to have them maintained in workshops there. Current property law does not provide for that. So, then, we need a tougher re-presentation of the scoping exercise and clear guidelines from Parliament. That is why we are calling on the Council to wait until September to issue a mandate, that is, until Parliament has drawn up clear guidelines for a mandate for trade relations with Japan. Bernd Lange,  
on behalf of the S&amp;D Group.

 Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, I, too, would like to thank the rapporteur, Mr Fjellner, and also the shadow rapporteur, Mr Martin, and the other shadow rapporteurs. They really have succeeded in negotiating a good compromise. I also call for us to pass this compromise with the largest possible majority, as there has been real success here in granting these unilateral advantages in a more targeted way. The EU’s trade policy, after all, is oft-criticised. In this area, however, it is clear that we are granting unilateral advantages to the poorest and next-to-poorest countries in the world, so that they can bolster their development on the back of these advantages. We will now be making this more targeted, and that is exactly the right approach to take. With the GSP+ countries, we are inviting them – on the basis of common values in relation to human rights and sustainability – to intensify trade relations with us still further. This also helps to strengthen sustainable development on the global level. Here too, then, what we have is a reasonable approach. We have also ensured, however, that there are not sudden distortions in our industrial relations. In that connection, we have incorporated appropriate safety nets in those areas in which there is a competitive environment for our industrial products, so that we can very confidently say that we are granting unilateral advantages without jeopardising any jobs within the European Union. For those countries that will be leaving the GSP scheme, it goes without saying that the door is not closed. We invite all of them to conclude intensive trade relations with us – be it via bilateral trade negotiations, through the WTO, or through economic partnership agreements (EPAs) – with the aim of bringing about sustainable development.

 Mr President, Mr De Gucht, I believe it is clear that trade is not an end in itself but a means of improving people’s living conditions. A glance at the situation in Colombia and Peru shows that the process of improving living conditions there involves major challenges. Against this background, Parliament is, of course, investigating very carefully, on the basis of the rights granted to it under the Treaty of Lisbon, whether this trade agreement with Colombia and Peru meets these requirements. It is very unlikely that the trade agreement alone will be able to overcome these challenges. The issues include the extent to which civil society is included in the process of implementing the trade agreement, the independence of its involvement and the options for instigating complaint procedures. There is also the question of the restrictions placed on efforts to implement the sustainability chapter. Article 267 and Article 277 specify the possible restrictions relating to material resources. We believe it is necessary for us to enter into additional agreements with the Colombian and the Peruvian governments so that we can be certain that the trade agreement will bring about significant improvements in the living conditions of the people. One aspect of this involves improving the employment rights of people who are working in the informal sector. Around 58% of people in Colombia, for example, are employed in the informal sector and their working conditions are quite different from those of people with formal jobs. The question of how the interests of workers are represented must be reconsidered, in particular, in the light of International Labour Organisation (ILO) Conventions 129 and 135. Job security and social dialogue also need to be improved in line with ILO Convention 144. The United States and Switzerland have put in place action plans to accompany their free trade agreements and we should follow their example. Bernd Lange  (S&amp;D

 Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, you will have noticed from Mr Lambsdorff’s remarks that the issue here is not an objective debate, but rather the elections in Germany. All I can say here is that for a party on the political defensive, a debate like this, with so many wrong-headed arguments, may be one way to stay afloat. However this is to ignore the facts. The situation in Germany is that the government supported by Mr Lambsdorff’s party already levies a tax rate on diesel above the future minimum tax rate. At present, we have a minimum tax rate of EUR 0.33 in Germany, which would be increased to EUR 0.41; however, the German Government already takes EUR 0.47. In other words, there would be no immediate change. Thus, it is wrong to say that the price of diesel fuel will sky-rocket in the morning. The second point is proportionality. We Social Democrats have always said that proportionality is not unconditional. We have tabled Amendment 15 precisely with this in mind. We must not drive the diesel engine to extinction through taxation. We Social Democrats proposed this amendment, which the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs was happy to adopt. But what happens next? Obviously our Liberal and Conservative colleagues distrust their own governments because the definition of the absolute tax rate is still a matter for the Member States and their governments. The level of distrust is so great that they believe that if this resolution is adopted, the governments they support will increase diesel taxes. That is why I can understand it when people say that this distrust will result in the rejection of proportionality. If your distrust really is so great, then I believe it is right to reject proportionality in this case. I have one final word to add. If everyone is suddenly a supporter of diesel, then I find myself wondering why these governments are not moving to switch from taxing cars to taxing CO2
 emissions, benefiting the more economical diesel engine. You can do this immediately without consulting Europe. What is stopping you? Bernd Lange  (S&amp;D

Blue-card question.

Mr Seeber, I have a supplementary question. Are you unaware that we Social Democrats tabled an amendment in the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs drawing attention to precisely this problem – namely, that this could lead to problems with industrial policy and the questioning of the CO2
 reduction strategy for cars – and that this amendment was adopted by the Economic Affairs Committee? Bernd Lange  (S&amp;D

 Mr President, Mr Mato Adrover, I see things in a fundamentally different way. This agreement cannot be compared with the fisheries agreement. In the case of the fisheries agreement, it was not clear where the money paid by the European Union would be going. In this case we have clear rules about who benefits from the money – and the beneficiaries really are Moroccan producers – as well as about European investments into Morocco. With that being the case, the situation is completely different. It is also completely clear that, with this agreement, we are not legitimising the situation in Western Sahara. On the contrary, we are saying clearly that a solution needs to be found in the interests of the people. We are also making that clear with our resolution. We cannot, however, send out a signal to the Arab Spring that we will always seal off our markets per se. We do need to offer solutions for fair trade so that there really can be change through trade. It also means that, if there really are distortions in the European Union in agriculture, we need to ensure, within the EU, that our farmers also have development perspectives. We cannot simply close our borders, however. That would be a signal that would heighten the sense of disappointment in the Arab Spring. For these reasons I will recommend to Members in my group that they vote in favour of this agreement. Bernd Lange,

 Mr President, Mr Bütikofer, I too wish to start by expressing my thanks for this ambitious report and the huge amount of work it has entailed. Mr Tajani, raw materials policy is essential to the development of European industry. The trade dimension is decisive, which is why I believe it is right for raw materials policy to be anchored in an international context from the perspective of industrial policy in Europe. A number of points are key here: If we intend to secure our supply of raw materials in the world by means of partnership agreements, we can only do this by ensuring that the businesses that extract these raw materials also conduct themselves in a reasonable way. It is unacceptable for European businesses to evade tax or for workers to be required to work under inhuman conditions. That is why it is clear that if we intend to mine raw materials, then businesses need to comply with clear social and environmental standards. Secondly, we must also ensure that the raw materials that we use do not come from crisis regions and are not used to finance groups who use the money earned from raw materials to fund civil war. We need an international certification system for the extraction of raw materials and for tracing trade, so that we can tell where raw materials come from. By the way, excellent footprints can be found for raw materials everywhere. Thirdly, we must ensure that we do not export raw materials illegally. In our own interests, we need to close any loopholes in our legislation – this last remark is addressed to Mr Florenz. However, we also need to improve controls. The system will never work if a single individual is to be required to ensure controls in a large European port. Exports need closer monitoring and it is necessary to ensure that monopolistic and oligopolistic structures in raw materials trade are eliminated. The good news, Commissioner, is that the Commission is moving in the right direction. Bernd Lange  (S&amp;D

 Mr President, Commissioner, we all firmly believe that we must help the people in Pakistan, but the instrument that you are proposing, Commissioner, is the wrong one, for three reasons. The first is that there is absolutely no proof that trade facilitation will benefit the people affected by the floods. On the contrary, we can even see that the textile industry in Pakistan is based in other regions and, in recent years, has even experienced growth. Thus, this sector is not really affected at all. How we intend to help the people affected by the floods by means of trade facilitation is beyond me. Secondly, I cannot understand how we can now grant these facilitations to a country that plainly does not meet the GSP+ conditions in terms of social and environmental standards and send a signal to other countries, like Bangladesh, which do meet these conditions, that essentially tells them that their efforts are not wanted and it is also possible to achieve this status by other means. My third argument, Commissioner, is that this is not an approach based on solidarity, because the burden in Europe is borne in a one-sided manner by certain sectors and certain countries only. If we want to do something, then we should do so in a spirit of solidarity with all countries and with the involvement of everyone, and that means we need direct aid for the flood victims. That would be the right approach to take. Bernd Lange  (S&amp;D
).

 Madam President, Commissioner, I really do think it is important that, following the entry into force of the Treaty of Lisbon, we decide on the structure of the negotiations together, because this Treaty gives Parliament a new role in trade relations. If we once again consider the fact that India is clearly a market of the future, we must also feed this back into a clear position adopted by Parliament: In our view, industrial development in the European Union – linked to jobs – is of key importance. We therefore need to make it clear that the interests of jobs in industry in Europe must take priority in the trade agreements. For that reason, although an agreement has to be asymmetrical, at the end of the day, the tariffs must be zero. It is not acceptable for us to have tariffs of 100% in mechanical engineering and the automotive sector and, in the end, perhaps negotiate 50%. As long as we do not have any zero tariffs, it will encourage investments outside Europe. Therefore, Commissioner, we need to clearly define our priority areas and they lie in industry. We also need a level playing field to be established with regard to social standards, and it is also necessary for clear obligations to be imposed on India in relation to workers’ rights. Bernd Lange  (S&amp;D

Madam President, I am somewhat disappointed that Parliament was unable to approve this by a majority today in order to learn sensible lessons from the reactor disaster in Japan. I consider it beyond question that this must mean organising a clear shift in energy policy away from nuclear energy – in order words, the beginning of a phase-out – at European level. Secondly, it should also be obvious that if we carry out stress tests, then any nuclear power plant that fails these tests is required to be removed from the grid. Neither of these proposals received a majority in the vote. I was therefore unable to support the resolution. I hope that we will soon succeed in organising a uniform energy policy that provides us with safe and sensible energy in the future, which means movement towards energy efficiency and renewable energies.

 Madam President, Mr Tajani, ladies and gentlemen, this report presents the position of the European Parliament very clearly. I would like thank the shadow rapporteurs who have contributed to the report and the rapporteurs for the opinion of the relevant committees. Together, we have succeeded in conveying a clear message, Mr Tajani, which is that we want to move industrial policy closer to the centre of the political arena, for good reason. Industrial policy will help us, firstly, to create good quality, future-proof jobs in Europe and, secondly, to secure investment in Europe. Our competitors all over the world are making good use of industrial policy, for example, in the United States, China, Brazil and India. Thirdly, we are faced with challenges relating to sustainability, both in terms of the climate and the economic and social foundations of our society. Against this background, it is important for us to put industrial policy at the centre of the political arena. On the one hand, this means that we expect industrial policy to be integrated in such a way, Mr Tajani, that it becomes the focal point of legislative initiatives within the European Union. We do not want to see environmental, trade and competition policies being drawn up first and only subsequently being coordinated with the interests of European industry. On the contrary, we must define the other areas of policy on the basis of the strategic interests of a sustainable industrial policy. Secondly, Mr Tajani, we need better coordination between the industrial policies in the different Member States. Therefore, I would like to ask you, and we have included this in the report, to make use of Article 173(2) of the Treaty of Lisbon, in order to coordinate industrial policy in the Member States more effectively, so that we really are all moving in the same direction. We must, of course, focus on a number of specific areas. On the horizontal level, we need to look, in particular, at innovation policy throughout the entire value-added chain. We must succeed in supporting the entire economic chain, from fundamental research through to the market launch of products, and in bringing the best solutions for our society onto the market. We also need to pay more attention to resources. Simply saying that this is important is not enough. We need to introduce practical legislation which will significantly increase resource productivity. In industry, labour is responsible for 20% of costs and resources for 40%. That is a starting point for action on raw materials. The mobile phones that we all use contain rare earths and metals, which are seldom recycled. The recycling rate for mobile phones is only 1.5%. That is a starting point for creating jobs and increasing the competitiveness of European industry. I would like to make one last point in this context. Innovation and resource productivity will not happen by themselves. They depend on the employees who are involved. For this reason, a sensible industrial policy must also take into consideration the skills and the involvement of employees. If we can bring this about, then I am confident that we will have future-proof jobs in European industry. Bernd Lange,  
rapporteur.

 Madam President, Mr Tajani, ladies and gentlemen, thank you very much for your many inspiring contributions. Mr Tajani, the four key messages which bring us together are clear. Firstly, we want to ensure that industrial policy lies at the heart of EU policy. Secondly, we want to link together sustainability and competitiveness and develop them further. Thirdly, we must not take a dogmatic approach, because this area cannot be regulated by the market alone or by the state alone. We need practical, sensible measures. Fourthly, this is just the beginning and not the end of the discussion on modernising industrial policy in the European Union. We are extending a hand to you, Mr Tajani, but we are also aware that we must take you at your word. We are expecting concrete legislative proposals and also concrete measures to provide financial support, particularly in the field of research. Mr Tajani, if we are successful, and if the hand that we are extending to you and the statement that you have made are compatible, perhaps we will find ourselves in a situation similar to that at the end of the wonderful film ‘Casablanca’, when Humphrey Bogart says to the police captain: ‘I think this is the beginning of a beautiful friendship!’ Bernd Lange,

 Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, the Treaty of Lisbon has in fact put trade policy on a new footing. The EU is solely responsible for trade policy and Parliament gives or withholds its consent. In that respect, we have gained a new responsibility. We can only enable this new responsibility to take shape if we act together. We have proven that very clearly in this matter. In this regard, I would also like to thank the rapporteurs and shadow rapporteurs. Trade policy is not an end in itself. Its purpose is, firstly, to strengthen jobs and industrial development in the European Union and, secondly, to improve conditions for people in other countries of the world. The aim of trade policy must be to achieve both of these goals. We therefore need to assess this agreement from this viewpoint. Overall, this is a step in the right direction towards fulfilling these two requirements. However, we certainly do have a few points of criticism, for example the question of duty drawback in South Korea, which will bring one-sided competitive advantages for certain sectors of industry in South Korea, particularly in sensitive areas such as the automotive industry. It was therefore right for us to have very intensive talks about a safeguard clause and also to have jointly implemented such a clause, which provides for the close monitoring of precisely these points, so that we can be certain that the possibilities provided by duty drawback in South Korea do not lead to a distortion of competition in Europe. Parliament has rightly established safeguards here. Secondly, this agreement also has the purpose of improving the situation in South Korea for our colleagues there. South Korea still has improvements to make with regard to Chapter 13, in particular the question of the core labour standards laid down by the ILO. Two absolutely crucial core labour standards – No 87 and No 98, relating to collective bargaining – have not be implemented or ratified. Section 314 of the penal code relates to the obstruction of business. Neither of these things is in line with the nature and the provisions of this agreement. Thus, Commissioner, I am relying on you, and on the statement that you have given in support of the safeguard clause, to change this situation in South Korea so that this agreement will represent a blueprint for the future to enable globalisation to proceed in a fair manner. Bernd Lange,  
on behalf of the S&amp;D Group.

 Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, I would first like to add my thanks to the rapporteur for the good cooperation that has helped Parliament unanimously adopt an extremely fundamental position in Committee – which is very much to be welcomed – and which has once again made clear the significance of this safeguard regulation. Together with the agreement with South Korea, this is the first agreement that we have negotiated following the entry into force of the Treaty of Lisbon, which gave Parliament a new role that it must play. Secondly, this Free Trade Agreement with South Korea and the safeguard regulation are also something of a blueprint for future agreements, and to this extent, we must tread particularly carefully here. These are two important reasons why we should not nonchalantly adopt diluted positions, but should really fight for prudent regulations to be adopted. As you are aware, Commissioner, there are six points that we are particularly concerned about here. I would like to give a brief recap of what these are. Firstly, the duty drawback mechanism. If Korean manufacturers use parts from third countries when manufacturing their goods, they do not have to pay duty on these and can export them to Europe, while European manufacturers – even if they use the same parts – do not enjoy this exemption from duty. This therefore provides Korean manufacturers with a competitive advantage. This must be closely monitored to see whether it gives rise to distortion of the market. That cannot be achieved by means of a simple declaration; rather, it must be made legally binding by including it in the safeguard regulation as a basis for initiating investigations. Secondly, there will also be regional variation. The sensitive sectors are not all represented equally strongly in all the Member States. Consequently, we must pay particular attention to how sensitive sectors in individual regions can be protected from targeted assaults. That is no simple task, because we are in an internal market – but a political solution must be found. Thirdly, as this is the first agreement since the Treaty of Lisbon, Commissioner, it also involves a new balance between the Council and Parliament; and since we have also reached agreement with the Commission, it is only right that an equal role for Parliament and the Council is anchored in the agreement. Fourthly, the implementation processes are, of course, your business – we have no desire to interfere with the operational implementation – but as Parliament we must ensure that Parliament’s rights are not brought into question in the comitology procedure. In particular, we need a right of withdrawal – this, too, must be ensured. My fifth point is that many decades of experience with South Korea has shown us that in addition to tariff trade policy, non-tariff barriers to trade are constantly being constructed. We must therefore also have a clear mechanism for monitoring, reporting and initiating consultations should problems arise in the area of non-tariff barriers to trade. My sixth point is that if we are serious about this new kind of trade agreement, then we must also involve and strengthen civil society. This means that fundamental ILO standards – such as standard 87, which grants workers the right to strike – need to be firmly rooted and implemented. In contrast, Article 314 of South Korea’s penal code states that ‘Interfering with the smooth running of the business’ is a criminal offence. We need to do something about this – civil society must be strengthened, fundamental ILO standards and fundamental environmental standards must be ensured, and civil society must also be involved in the monitoring of the agreement in the form of the Domestic Advisory Groups. My final point, Commissioner, is that you said that provisional application will most likely occur once agreement has been reached. I would like to delete this ‘most likely’. Provisional application cannot take place until Parliament has reached a decision on this matter! (Applause) Bernd Lange  (S&amp;D

Mr President, President-in-Office of the Council, Commissioner, I, too, would like to thank the Spanish Presidency and also the Commission for bringing the subject of electromobility to the fore. I also believe that we can use electromobility to revitalise the mobility economy in Europe, and we need to do that in order to create value and to safeguard jobs. However – to use another metaphor – we need to step on the accelerator, because the issue of electromobility affects many policy areas. There is, of course, the issue of standardisation, technology, but also the question of the integration of electromobility into the whole transport system, because we may need new forms of mobility, particularly in urban areas. Energy must be renewable and we need raw materials, so trade is also affected. Therefore, I would ask you, Commissioner, to perhaps integrate electromobility further in the follow-on from Cars 21. Bernd Lange  (S&amp;D
).

 Mr President, in the opinion of the Committee on Industry, Research and Energy, it is, of course, also important to protect small and medium-sized enterprises. Commissioner, competition is not an end in itself. If we look at the situation of small dealerships and small workshops, we need to increase their economic ability to act, otherwise one day we will only have large dealerships and large workshop chains. This includes, firstly, genuine authorisation for multi-branding. It includes allowing workshops and dealerships to have unrestricted access to information on vehicles and repair options. Thirdly, it includes providing the necessary opportunities for gaining qualifications. We talked earlier about electromobility. They also need to be in a position to maintain electric cars. Fourthly, they need investment security, in other words contractual protection and no more revisions. They need to be able to make safe investments over a long period. Bernd Lange,  
deputising for the author.

 Mr President, Commissioner, I have three questions on my mind. The first is, why are we still lacking transparency when the Treaty of Lisbon has been in force since 1 December and we have had an interinstitutional agreement with the Commission since 10 February? I cannot understand why it is still the case that the Council is sitting at the table as an observer in the negotiations, Parliament is not involved and the documents are not publicly accessible. So why is this, Commissioner? The second question that is of concern to me is this: who is actually negotiating the ACTA Agreement? This is not being negotiated as some sort of follow-up agreement to TRIPS within the framework of the World Trade Organisation. It is only being negotiated by individual States and – as we hear from the United States – also by powerful economic interests. I ask myself whether, in fact, standards are not being set which will ultimately apply to everyone even though not everyone is sitting round the negotiating table. The third question that is troubling me, Commissioner, is this: what actually is the substance of the negotiations? In your hearing, you answered my question and assured me that the acquis communautaire
 was secure. However, when I look at individual papers that have leaked out I unfortunately have my doubts about this. I understand that negotiations are being held, that blocks on the Internet are possible, that providers are to be used, so to speak, to help police the Internet for economic interests, that restrictions on research and science may sometimes be imposed and that some people are even trying to introduce general surveillance systems. I therefore ask myself, where in all this is the acquis communautaire
? There is also the question of compensation. The fact that the inclusion of lost profit in the compensation is being negotiated is not appropriate for our policy. Of course, my third question, Commissioner, is what is the actual relationship between online and offline? When I read that online and offline are both supposed to represent the digital world, does that essentially mean that there are also to be restrictions and searches of laptops, iPods and MP3 players at borders? Would you please provide answers to these three questions. Bernd Lange  (S&amp;D
). 
 – (DE)
 Mr President, Commissioner, we all know that GSP is a good system and that GSP+ is a very good system. We also need to ensure their extension and so we need your proposal so that we can have a proper debate in Parliament. So, Commissioner, please speed things up. Even for GSP+, we may be able to introduce a few improvements. In this regard, there are five points that I would like to make concerning areas where we may be able to make further improvements. Firstly, who determines how the 27 standards are actually implemented, not only recognised in practice, but formally implemented? Is that the task of the ILO alone, or do we not need an assessment committee to provide specific support during implementation? Secondly, how are we involving civil society? I would like to see the coordination of civil society in the country in question in the assessment of the implementation of GSP+, just as we have now agreed in the agreement with South Korea. Thirdly, who actually initiates an investigation if any problems are detected? Parliament needs to be involved here, because I have the feeling that, in the Council, interests other than actually having an investigation carried out come into play. Parliament should also initiate an investigation in this connection. We surely also need clear structures for the next steps that we are to take as well as clearer structures for withdrawal, but perhaps we can talk about this in detail another time. Bernd Lange  (S&amp;D
). 
 – (DE)
 Mr President, Mr De Gucht, I have three questions for you. My first question concerns the need for fair competition conditions. The fact that employees’ rights in South Korea are restricted means that there are unfair competitive conditions, which include the question of collective action. Paragraph 314 of the South Korean Criminal Code refers to the crime of ‘disrupting operations’. This is used to prevent strikes and to limit the rights of trade unions, for example, in the case of Ssangyong. I would also like to know why we are concluding free trade agreements with countries such as South Korea and Colombia which have the most problems with the standards of the International Labour Organisation. Therefore, my first question is this: How do you propose to use the free trade agreement to ensure that there are no unfair competition conditions in South Korea caused by restrictions on employees’ rights? My second question relates to the problems in the car industry, which several other speakers have also referred to. It is very important in this case that there are sensible safeguard clauses. General safeguard clauses are currently in place for major market disruptions and for the duty drawback system. I am not able to understand this fully. Mr De Gucht, perhaps you could explain the safeguard clauses to me in simple terms. I would particularly like to know who can trigger them and when. My third question concerns the new contractual basis for our cooperation introduced by the Treaty of Lisbon. This includes approving safeguard clauses and implementation as part of the codecision process. Can you guarantee that the free trade agreement will not be put into force until Parliament has approved this procedure and only after Parliament has exercised its rights and adopted the safeguard clauses? Bernhard Rapkay,  
rapporteur.

 Mr President, I would like to just briefly explain the motion to postpone the debate. As you know, we held a number of rounds of negotiations with the Council about the unitary patent quite some time ago, and we reached a joint result at the end of November last year. The package consists of three parts: the patent regulation itself via the codecision procedure, the implementing regulation via the consultation procedure and a third area, consisting of an intergovernmental agreement. We reached an agreed result and, on 2 December last year, the chair of the Committee on Legal Affairs, Mr Lehne, received a letter from the Presidency of the Council containing the agreed text and a covering letter in which the Council committed to adopt exactly the enclosed text if Parliament adopted exactly what we had negotiated and agreed as well. For seven months, nothing has happened, as the Council has failed to get its act together on another matter, namely, the issue of where the seat of the central division of the patent court should be. This issue is not within our competence, however, and accordingly we have not got involved. There were three interested parties in this dispute, and in the last week the Council has decided, in its wisdom – something about which we are all aware – that all three interested parties will be getting the nod. That is not the crucial point, however, for which reason there is clearly cause to wonder whether what we have here is something of an oriental bazaar, but that would be an unfair insult to the serious traders of oriental bazaars. The problem is that it was also agreed to interfere in Parliament’s competences and to delete something from the regulation itself, specifically, three key articles. Coreper will be meeting tomorrow morning at 09.00 and formalising what the Heads of State or Government have agreed. It plans to then present us with that new text at 10.30 so that we can hold a debate on the basis of the new text in the afternoon, followed by a vote on Wednesday. This is a blatant violation of our agreement, and I believe that this is the first time this has happened in the history of our negotiations, informal trialogues, with the Council. This is not acceptable, Mr President, and that is why we are requesting that the item be taken off the agenda. (Applause)
 We are moving to have the item taken off the agenda as we cannot allow what I have just outlined to happen. Should Coreper decide tomorrow to adopt what is before me now, we will still have to discuss how we can move forward with this dossier all in all. Mr President, in order to avoid any interested parties getting the wrong impression, however, I want to make it clear that this is not just about this procedural issue, it is about a fundamental content-related issue. In many people’s view – including that of the Council in the negotiations themselves in the course of the last year – the removal of the three articles that has now been decided on is a blatant violation of European law. It is important to be aware of this. They want a regulation and a regulation should regulate something. They want to take out the regulatory content, in other words, exactly the things that are supposed to be regulated. That is remarkable in itself and it is why we have to take this item off the agenda at all events. Bernhard Rapkay,  
rapporteur
. – (DE)
 Mr President, I would just like to say one thing regarding the debate previously mentioned on the immunity of Mr de Magistris, as I am also rapporteur in that case. I would like to point out that no debate on this has been included in the agenda, only a vote. I would also like to point that there are proceedings being brought against Mr de Magistris on a total of five accounts. This is only about one of these that is relatively uncontroversial. As regards the other accounts, we will first hear what Mr de Magistris has to say. Bernhard Rapkay,  
rapporteur
. – (DE)
 Mr President, I just wanted to clarify that, because some Members asked about it earlier. With regard to the defence of the parliamentary immunity of Viktor Uspaskich I have to say that this is not in fact what it is about. Mr Uspaskich does not have parliamentary immunity. Parliament waived Mr Uspaskich’s parliamentary immunity on 7 September 2010 – in other words, more than a year ago – and that situation has not changed. On the contrary, Mr Uspaskich has asked for his immunity to be reinstated on the basis of new information that he claims to have. What is the issue here? Mr Uspaskich is accused by the Lithuanian law enforcement authorities of having contravened party law and tax law in Lithuania during the period from 2004 to 2006 when he was chair of his party. He was not a Member of this House between 2004 and 2006. He was, however, a member of the Seimas (the Lithuanian Parliament). In 2008, the Seimas waived his immunity. He was then elected to the European Parliament in 2009, where he obviously received immunity once again. Then we had to deal with the matter. He was heard in Parliament twice. I want to make this point, because he always claims that he had no opportunity to present his case. He had two hearings in committee. I do not know whether Mr Uspaskich is guilty or whether he is innocent. He always maintains that he is innocent. I do not know. However, it is not my job, nor is it your job, to decide. It is the job of the judicial authorities in the Member State of Lithuania to decide. We simply have to determine whether two particular aspects to this case are such that his immunity, which he naturally has as a Member of the European Parliament, should be retained and that he should be subject to a different procedure to that of any normal citizen of his country. We have come to the conclusion that this is not the case. One aspect relates to the question of whether, through such proceedings, he is prevented from expressing his free political opinion as an MEP – but contravention of tax legislation actually has nothing to do with freedom of expression. The second aspect relates to the fact that, as a result of these proceedings, he is persecuted to a certain extent in his political activities. That is something that gives cause for consideration. However, after careful deliberation – following two hearings and after questioning the Lithuanian authorities once again – we reached the conclusion that this was not the case either. Thus, there was nothing else that we could do except waive his immunity. Mr Uspaskich then went to the Court of Justice of the European Union – as he is entitled to do – to the General Court, and brought an action for the annulment of our decision and for the suspension of the decision until the hearing for the main case. Of course, the Court of Justice of the European Union accepted this, but it rejected the application for a temporary order. Mr Uspaskich then declared that he had new information. Apparently, in WikiLeaks facts were published that confirm his position, and he is therefore asking for the case to be considered once again. He also said that he would withdraw his application to the court. I advised him most strongly against doing that. This is the only route that will enable him to obtain his right in court. I strongly advised him not to do it, but he nevertheless withdrew his appeal to the court. We then discussed the new facts in another hearing and came to the conclusion that these new facts may perhaps be relevant to the proceedings themselves in Lithuania, but not to the decision concerning the waiving of his immunity. We discussed the matter in detail, debating it for and against in several sittings, and we came to the firm conclusion that there is no other option: as we are not deciding on guilt or innocence here, but only on whether he has privileged access, we have to conclude that neither the first point, regarding ‘the free expression of his political opinion’, nor the second point, namely ‘political persecution’ are relevant here. There therefore remains nothing else for us to do but to maintain his immunity waiver. We are not making a decision to withdraw his immunity because it has already been withdrawn. Thus, in the report we conclude that his immunity should remain withdrawn. Bernhard Rapkay,

 Mr President, I am, of course, also speaking as rapporteur, because I have been involved with this matter for a long time. I have not done this for the pleasure of it, nor was I particularly keen on doing it. However, what we have just heard is not proof that the majority in committee were wrong the first time and again the second time. Nothing – absolutely nothing – has been put forward that indicates that. I am not making a judgment with regard to the role that Mr Uspaskich plays in politics in Lithuania. That is not my job. It is not your job, either. This issue here is: is he getting a fair trial or not? You will have to prove to me that he is not getting a fair trial. This proof has not been provided. Mr Tomaševski, please refrain from making comments about Bolshevists and similar things. That has more of an effect of disqualifying you rather than helping to establish the truth. Just to make it clear once again: the issue here is not for us to say whether he is guilty or not guilty. It is a matter of whether his right to free expression is being restricted or whether he is being politically persecuted. We came to the conclusion that neither of these are the case. That is the reason for our decision in committee and why this report states what it does. I can only recommend that plenary also votes in favour of our report as a whole. Bernhard Rapkay,  
on behalf of the S&amp;D Group.

 Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, the explanatory statement from the rapporteur is quite correct and needs no amplification. For this reason, my group will give its consent to enhanced cooperation. There were also some contrary opinions among us – this is quite legitimate and these voices should be heard. However, what the rapporteur, Council Presidency and Commissioner have had to say shows that the time has really come and that we cannot drag our feet any longer. It is not the case, as some people claim, that this has all been agreed in haste without any discussion – like many of the other arguments, this is patently untrue. The language issue did not just become the subject of debate when the Commission presented its last proposal last year; this has been under discussion for a decade or more. There is nothing new about it. Anyone who looks at how different models have been presented and discussed in recent months cannot say that there has not been sufficient discussion. It is time to cut the Gordian knot! The second argument always used here is that we risk destroying the internal market. The fact is that we do not have an internal market where patents are concerned, so we cannot really destroy it. If – as has been the case for a long time – we are clear about the fact that the internal market really does need a uniform patent process in order to reach completion, then the entire internal market cannot be destroyed by this move. In the worst case scenario, things would remain as they are. I do believe that we will make progress, however. The third specific argument used is that Parliament would weaken its rights by consenting to enhanced cooperation: none of this is true. I would advise you to take a look at the Treaty of Lisbon and our Rules of Procedure. We will not relinquish a single right. We are now approving enhanced cooperation and, when this begins, we shall all have our individual rights. With regard to the language regime, of course this is simply a matter of consultation, since unanimity is required here. Codecision should apply to the actual patent regulation and the approval of patent jurisdiction, however. We are not relinquishing a single right, quite the opposite in fact. Bernhard Rapkay,  
rapporteur.

 Madam President, Mr Almunia, ladies and gentlemen, firstly, I would like to congratulate you, Mr Almunia, and your offices. The impact assessment that you have presented is very good. It is based on facts, it is conclusive and it gets to the point. It is a pity that the other members of the College of Commissioners have not read this impact assessment, because if they had read it, they would not have been able to present this proposal, which has nothing at all to do with the impact assessment. I wonder how the College of Commissioners picked the year, for example. There is absolutely no mention of this in the impact assessment. The only thing which might explain it is that 2014 is exactly halfway between 2010 and 2018. That is what it must be. However, it may be that they have also not understood the content. None of the arguments in favour of this proposal can be seriously considered because they are not correct. There is the argument that the State aid scheme adopted in 2002, which is about to expire, was a phasing out arrangement for coal mining. Of course, this is totally incorrect. It was a successor arrangement. I know this, because I was there and I was the rapporteur for Parliament in 2002. This is when the Treaty establishing the European Coal and Steel Community (ECSC) expired after 50 years and a successor arrangement was needed, not only with regard to aid, but also other issues. If this had been a phasing out arrangement, what would have happened, for example, to the ECSC’s assets? It was not a phasing out arrangement, it was a successor arrangement. At the time, we agreed with good reason on a period of eight years for this successor arrangement, after which we would look at the issue again. Therefore, this argument is incorrect. The second argument which is put forward is the question of sustainability. We are all in favour of this and we know that coal, of course, produces large quantities of CO2
 emissions. However, a decision made by the Commission cannot abolish the laws of science. What will happen next? Domestic coal will be replaced by imported coal. That is the only thing that will happen. Imported coal emits just the same amount of CO2
 as domestic coal. The problem is simply that if we no longer have reference points, we will not be able to use them in the development of new, state-of-the-art technologies for mining and power stations. Europe is a leader in this area and has an export advantage. I do not believe that we should just give this up. The third argument is that aid is harmful and that the money would be better spent on other things. It is not possible to say anything against this argument or against the attitude of market radicals. You cannot oppose an ideology with facts. However, the statement that this would be too expensive, for example, should be looked at in the light of what it would really mean if mining were to be stopped abruptly, and 2014 would be an abrupt stop. It would result in an increase in the costs of combating unemployment and, above all, in the costs relating to long-term pit closures. This is a very complicated and complex subject. The costs of long-term pit closures continue to be incurred years and even decades after coal mining comes to an end. The costs have to be paid out of the public purse. However, some Member States have a system in place which ensures that the state is not responsible for these costs. Therefore, this argument also does not hold water. For this reason, I recommend that you think this over again as soon as possible and that you pay attention to what is said in the impact assessment. Otherwise, the result will be regional and socio-political distortions, which we do not want. This is why the 2018 proposal is highly sensible. Bernhard Rapkay,  
rapporteur.

 Madam President, Mr Almunia, that is exactly the problem. You are right when you confirm to Mr Lange that it is a Council regulation. However, it also depends on whether the Commission hears the arguments put forward in the Council and here in Parliament. You must drop this very stringent proposal, as you have done, so that it is possible for a sensible, democratic approach to be taken, which involves a majority decision that does not require unanimity. I would like to make a second remark to Mr Chatzimarkakis. The review clause which you referred to is completely irrelevant in this case. The disputes which took place in Germany were only intended to save the face of the Minister for Economic Affairs there, nothing more. Now, I would like to look at the concern expressed by Mr Almunia. No one here and not even the report itself is questioning the fact that this is a phasing out arrangement, Mr Almunia. Whether it is sensible in terms of energy policy or technology is another question. What Mr Geier said is absolutely correct, but we are not calling that into question. The only question is whether we should do this relatively abruptly in 2014 or whether there are sensible transitional arrangements for 2018. Otherwise, we are not questioning anything. The situation is not as described by Mr Lambert, for example, who read out his speech and then left. He should have stayed here, because he might have learned something. It is not the case that there are Member States who have done nothing at all. That is not true of Spain, of Poland, of Romania or of Germany. In 1990, more than 200 000 people were working in the mining industry in Germany. Now, 20 years later, the figure is around 20 000. This represents a drop of 90%, leaving only 10% of the jobs still in place. There have been a number of pit closures between 2002 and the present day during the period of this regulation, which is still in force. Let us not behave as if nothing has happened. The question is whether or not we need a sensible transitional period to be able to achieve this without causing socio-political damage. I can only say, yes, we do need one. This four-year period should not be an issue, because no one is calling that into question anyway. Please take that message back to the Commission. Bernhard Rapkay,  
rapporteur.

 Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, and when I say ‘ladies and gentlemen’, I include you, Baroness Ashton, Mr Šefčovič, your team and the Council Presidency, because, at the end of the day, we experienced collegial cooperation, without which we would surely not have achieved the result that we did. I am happy with the result, at least as regards the part for which I was responsible and where I had a grasp of the overall picture. However, I would say that this is not so very surprising, because it is not as if we have only just started. Mr President, it was a very clever idea of yours to call all the rapporteurs together on a regular basis for an exchange of ideas right from an early stage – back at the time of the Brok, Verhofstadt and Gualtieri reports. As a result, for the relevant people, it was clear what would need to be done later, and for those who were to do this later work, it was clear what had already been done in terms of preparatory work. For this reason, it was primarily a matter of applying to the Staff Regulations the organisational aspects of what had been agreed between Parliament and the Council in connection with the establishment of the European External Action Service in the particular areas of competence covered by these Staff Regulations. When I say organisational, I mean that organisation is policy and policy is organisation. That is, of course, something that we found repeatedly during the detailed negotiations, because it was already clear at that point that perhaps one person may interpret something one way and others may interpret it somewhat differently. However, the spirit of cooperation resulted, I believe, in us finding very sensible solutions to such issues. What did we actually need to do, then, in terms of policy adjustment and what did we need to lay down in the Staff Regulations? Firstly, we had to incorporate the equal treatment of the three staffing components. I want to mention this point because, as you know, the treaty states that the staff of the EEAS shall comprise officials from the Commission, the Council and from the diplomatic services of the Member States. The last of these elements, in particular, did pose something of an issue, as it was something new. We had to resolve the almost antagonistic contradiction between the Community approach and the intergovernmental approach. It goes without saying that the Council and the Member States take more of an intergovernmental approach, while we prefer the Community approach. I believe I can say that we then worked out a solution to this together. To that extent, then, we can be very satisfied. What we needed, and indeed must continue, to take into account is gender balance and a balance in terms of geographical origin. We want to have a service that is modern, including with regard to the issue of gender equality. I am pleased, Baroness Ashton, that, in addition to what we have incorporated into the Staff Regulations as mandatory, you have assured us that you will make another personal statement, which will form part of the whole package. That already represents considerable progress with regard to both the aspect of gender equality and the other aspect of geographical balance. We need equal rights and equal obligations, and that includes loyalty – and indeed from all three components – towards the institution of the High Representative, currently embodied by Baroness Ashton. In this regard, we had a bit of additional work to do as far as the veto right of the diplomatic services was concerned in connection with possible extensions to the contracts of staff coming from the diplomatic services. However, we resolved this, too. There is one issue that should not be underestimated. We jointly agreed that this issue cannot be accommodated in the Staff Regulations. This is the fact that the new European diplomatic service also needs something of a separate identity. Everyone working there must be working towards the same goal and therefore, a common form of training and further training is also extremely important. That was especially important to some of my fellow negotiators, and I can understand that. I have just said that we did not succeed in doing this. It was clear that it would not be possible to incorporate something like this into the Staff Regulations systematically. However, here, once again, I have to thank the High Representative, because I have been informed that she also wants to say something about this and that she regards it as a major obligation and a major necessity and will also make another declaration of commitment in this regard, which, although not a component of the Staff Regulations, will reassure us and those who view it as particularly important as we look to the future work of the common External Action Service. Bearing all that in mind, we have done a very good job, and the service is now set for a sound start on 1 December. Bernhard Rapkay,  
rapporteur.

 Madam President, after my speech at the start of this debate, I actually only have two more comments to make. The first, which I quite deliberately left to the end of the debate, is that I would like to thank all of the shadow rapporteurs for their friendly and constructive cooperation. It is quite simply easier to negotiate when you know that your colleagues support you. For that reason, these were not the most difficult of negotiations. My second comment, however, is one that I would like to reiterate with regard to what has repeatedly been at the centre of this debate, namely, the question of geographical balance. Mrs Neynsky stole the show by saying that the compromise states nothing at all about this. I would simply suggest that, once we have adopted this, she quietly and calmly reads the text. Read the text! Reading the text will enlighten the mind. Then you will see that the compromise most definitely does contain statements – and indeed very strict, legally binding statements – on this matter. Then all of your concerns should, in fact, be dispelled. Matthias Groote and Bernhard Rapkay  (S&amp;D

 The German Social Democratic (SPD) delegation in the European Parliament is in favour of combating international terrorism and providing permanent protection for personal data with the highest possible degree of determination and effectiveness. In view of the importance of data protection, the SPD delegation did not make its decision lightly. After long and careful consideration, however, we are now able to vote in favour of the agreement: the Social Democrats have succeeded in providing for the establishment of permanent European monitoring in connection with the extraction of the data directly on the ground in the US Treasury Department – including the facility to stop the extraction of data. For us, the top priority was limiting the transfer of bulk data. SEPA data are not covered by the agreement; most transfers are not affected at all. The five-year data retention period is intended to be reviewed annually, whereby any data that is not needed is to be deleted sooner than this. In addition, an annual review of compliance with all data protection standards, with the involvement of data protection supervisors, is provided for. Even though we would have preferred the monitoring role and the transfer of data to be given to a judicial authority, Europol must carry out its mandate for approving the data transfer, provided for in the agreement, under the strict scrutiny of the EU. Although Europol has a reliable data protection system, it needs to be brought into line with the Treaty of Lisbon so that it can perform its duties under full democratic scrutiny.

 As the Committee on Legal Affairs’ rapporteur for the European External Action Service, I would like to point out that, including as a result of its amendments to Article 6 of the High Representative’s proposal, the report that has been agreed on today has absolutely no binding effect for me as rapporteur or for the European Parliament as a whole in the discussions on the adaptation of the Staff Regulations. This includes, in particular, the footnotes that were adopted in the text today. A report on a legislative proposal on which the European Parliament was only consulted cannot have any binding effect for the areas in which the European Parliament, by virtue of a different legal basis, has the power of codecision.

Mr President, almost everything has been said that needs to be said, so I will keep it brief. Why data retention? After all, food stocks have to be replaced sooner or later. That means consuming or using the food and buying a new lot. At the beginning, the debate about data retention focused on its use in anti-terrorism. In practice, however, these data are available, so apparently they have to be used, and they are accessed to investigate a very wide range of crimes, including minor or moderately serious offences. Moreover, in the process, there is a growing data hunger that is driving the storage of types of data that were not originally envisaged. The volume of data is growing. At the very least, then, we must reduce the amount of data stored, the types of use, and the duration of storage. We must protect data from abusive forms of access and use. We should be open to discussing alternatives to the current practice, and we must be mindful of one principle above all: that the rule of law and the protection of civil rights are key pillars of governance in our countries and the EU. They must be respected and defended, if necessary by abolishing the Directive. Birgit Sippel  (S&amp;D

Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, naturally it is possible to revise constitutions, media laws, Schengen rules and many other things. However there are rules. If the suspicion exists that existing laws and the values of the European Union are being violated, then this is something that must be pursued, whether in Hungary and Romania, or in France or Denmark, or any other country that could give cause for concern. I wonder, however, not just in view of the present debate, whether all those involved are really concerned with an objective clarification of events, or whether they are not more interested in party political mud-slinging or scoring party political points through sound-bites. This will not help us win back the confidence of our citizens. We need to arrange for an objective investigation to be carried out, using the same yardstick for all Member States, rather than different standards depending on whether we are located in the north, south, east or west of the European Union. If we consider the issue at the heart of these matters rather than relying on rumours and newspaper reports, then this discussion will have added value for the people of Hungary, Romania, France and Germany, and everyone else. Birgit Sippel  (S&amp;D

Mr President, let me state quite plainly from the start that freedom of movement within the EU is not a national right and thus cannot be restricted solely on a national basis. As the only elected European institution, the European Parliament must be fully consulted and given a say on all questions, whether relating to changes in the Schengen area or violations of Schengen rules. The reference to serious deficiencies at our external borders is dubious and factually incorrect. That is because the issue at stake is not just border controls, but also the excessive demands on some states immediately to investigate the legal status of every single refugee, thereby establishing clear perspectives for them. As Europeans, we must meet these challenges together, rather than sowing the seeds of uncertainty among our citizens with a crassly populist approach. This joint approach would be effective for our countries and our citizens, as well as for the refugees themselves. We should not regress to a parochial standpoint, because the fact is we need more Europe, not less. Birgit Sippel  (S&amp;D
).

Mr President, a number of years ago, terrorist attacks were given as the reason for introducing measures such as the retention of data or PNR. Obviously, terrorism alone is no longer enough to justify this gathering of data to our citizens, however. That is why we are currently talking about serious and organised crime and debating human trafficking; however the fact is that despite the millions of data records already on file, there have only been a few isolated successes so far. Ms Malmström argues that data protection has been improved, referring in particular to the fact that some data will be retained for ‘only’ 10 years. Data protection begins at an earlier stage, however, for example when a specific limitation of purpose is applied or when restricting the data that needs to be collected. What is it that the agreement that is to be voted on today allows? The retention of millions of data records relating mostly to completely innocent citizens, that will be checked and rechecked with different criteria for almost every conceivable purpose for the next 10 years. Other criminal activities are punishable with a custodial sentence of three years. The German Government has this to say on its website: Those travelling to the US should consider that some offences that do not even warrant a judicial process in Germany are punishable with custodial sentences of several years in the US. Penalties must apply across borders. According to the wording, it is sufficient for the suspect to intend to cross the border. This is something we all want to do when we travel to the US, as we already have the ticket for our return flight in our pockets. Furthermore, any court can demand this information. Will we have better data protection? In view of the broad range of applications, the possibility of data being forwarded to other authorities and to third countries is more than questionable. It is also regrettable that there is at present no provision for the participation of data protection specialists in the planned evaluation. At this point I do not wish to go into the fact that, in the US, terrorist suspects frequently remain in prison for several years awaiting official charges. A number of these people are innocent. We need to combat terrorism. However, this formulation clearly goes too far. Every citizen comes under suspicion and is delivered up to the US legal system, instead of protecting our values and the rights of our people. I have one final comment: Mr Albrecht asked whether those who vote in favour of the agreement should feel ashamed. No, no one should be ashamed about the way they vote today. Nonetheless, I am extremely concerned at the direction we would take by adopting this agreement and for this reason I am absolutely against it. Birgit Sippel  (S&amp;D

 Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, in the light of the history of the Hungarian people, it is particularly tragic that their own government is now withholding important rights from the citizens of Hungary. I would like to say to some speakers that even if a party was really elected by two-thirds of the people entitled to vote, it still has a specific responsibility in a democratic system to ensure that the political minority can present its views in the media and that the political minority is personally represented in the media, in the judiciary and in other areas. This is a principle which lies at the heart of democratic systems and it is a tragedy that this is not happening. The fact that we have to hold this debate today, and it is a good thing that we are doing so, is not just a result of the way in which the Hungarian Government is acting. It is also because the Council was not able in the past in the case of Hungary and in other situations to take up a clear position and to put the European values centre stage. It is also the fault of the European Commission, which has so far failed in its role as guardian of the Treaties. In the case of the independence of the judiciary, it is not about checking whether the change in the upper age limit for judges is in line with the anti-discrimination directive, instead we need to evaluate the entire package. Is the assumption justified that in future only members of a certain party will be represented in certain areas? I believe that, in the current difficult situation and in order to overcome the major challenges which face us, we need all the Member States and all the citizens of the European Union. For this reason, we must focus on values and not on individual laws. Birgit Sippel,  (S&amp;D

Madam President, I would like to propose a minor addition on behalf of my group in order to ensure that the rights of children and mothers are respected after sentencing. We would like to make an insertion after paragraph 4. I will read our proposal in English:  Reaffirms the importance of granting specific protection to mother detainees and to their children including through the use of alternative measures to detention in the child’s best interest, and calls on Member States and the Commission to actively promote and support such initiatives’.

 Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, why is it even necessary, in this House, in this European Union, to discuss detention conditions? The increasing mobility of our citizens and, in particular, the increased cooperation between the police force and the judicial system, as well as joint measures such as the European arrest warrant, require confidence. This is the confidence that everywhere in the EU, the Charter of Fundamental Rights and the Convention on Human Rights are being observed. It is confidence in properly functioning legal systems based on the principle of the presumption of innocence, in which a punishment is a punishment, not revenge or humiliation. However, many reports in the last few years and also many judgments of the European Court of Human Rights make it clear that we are still a long way from achieving this. The poor conditions relate to overcrowded prisons, a lack of opportunities for contact, a lack of medical care and many other issues besides. We urgently need common minimum standards for detention conditions and also for pre-trial detention. Long pre-trial detention periods, particularly if it is not in the person’s own Member State, can result in the loss of social contacts and jobs and, due to language barriers, they can entail isolation during detention. Therefore, in particular with regard to minor offences, alternatives to all forms of detention must be given greater consideration. The Commission’s Green Paper cites a number of examples in this regard. However, these need to be applied a great deal more in practice. The conclusion, then, is that minimum standards for detention conditions, a greater use of alternatives and special forms of accommodation for pregnant women and children are essential steps for us to take. The European Parliament has already called for changes to detention conditions in the past. Now, we must finally take specific measures. That is what we are calling for most strongly today and tomorrow. Birgit Sippel

 Mr President, Commissioner Reding, ladies and gentlemen, in the current times it is more important than ever to keep repeating that the European Union is more than just a market. It is a community of values, and it is precisely in difficult times that it must prove itself to be a strong community of values in all policy areas. The EU and its Member States are based on the common principles of freedom, democracy and the rule of law. An indispensable element of the rule of law in the context of criminal proceedings is the presumption of innocence, supported by clear and comprehensive procedural rights for the accused persons. Following the directive on the right to interpretation and to translation, the new directive on the right to information in criminal proceedings is a further important cornerstone in ensuring that suspected and accused persons are given a fair trial across the EU. The development of equal standards for procedural rights in criminal matters will strengthen our citizens’ trust in the judicial systems of the Member States. The mutual recognition of court decisions will also encourage this. An individual can only comprehensively exercise his procedural rights if he knows what those rights are. For a fair trial, it is crucial that people are aware of their rights and that they know what the accusation against them is. If authorities fail to observe these procedural rights, then they jeopardise the fairness of the proceedings and risk miscarriages of justice. The existing EU legal framework in the judicial area focuses on improved cooperation between judicial authorities. In contrast, the new directive concentrates on our citizens and the rights they enjoy in criminal proceedings. It states that police officers and prosecutors must provide people who have been arrested with written information concerning their rights in simple terms in a language they can understand. In addition to the right to interpretation and translation, this includes in particular informing them of the accusation against them, of the right to legal assistance and of the right to be heard by a judge without delay following arrest. In addition, Parliament has been able to expand the specific rights of which the suspect is to be informed. We have succeeded in integrating into the directive the right of access to medical assistance, the right to communication with relatives and the right to remain silent. No one knows in advance how long a suspected person will remain in pre-trial detention, for how long he will be deprived of his liberty. It is therefore important that he is informed of his rights at an early stage and is also given access to material evidence for and against him. The accused person must not become the object of the criminal proceedings, but rather must be able to play an active part in the proceedings. The Member States must now adopt and implement the directive as soon as possible. Finally, I would like to offer my thanks to the services of Parliament and of the Commission – and I would particularly like to thank the shadow rapporteurs, whose perseverance and really outstanding cooperation have made this report possible. It is now important that the Council and Commission bring the follow-up measures to this directive to a rapid conclusion jointly with the European Parliament, thereby creating uniform standards and fair trials throughout the EU. Birgit Sippel 
, rapporteur.

 Mr President, I believe Ms Reding has said it already; today’s debate has underlined once again what the unanimous decision in the Committee on Civil Liberties, Justice and Home Affairs made clear – namely that strengthening procedural rights is a concern of us all, whatever group we belong to and, to a certain extent, whichever Member State we represent. I therefore hope – and I am very confident about this – that we will again get a good proposal from the Commission for the next measure, which is the right to a lawyer; that we will be able to improve on this even further and that, following our discussions with the Council, we will once again be able to achieve a very good directive. I wish the rapporteur, Ms Antonescu, all the best with this and I believe she can count on the support of this House. Birgit Sippel  (S&amp;D

Madam President, the directive on combating the sexual abuse, sexual exploitation of children and child pornography sends out a clear message. This subject is an important one and one that concerns the whole of Europe, and uniform rules for the definition of offences and also for the penalties apply universally. Common arrangements for the prosecution of crimes committed outside the EU are still needed. The same applies to common standards for calling legal persons to account. The directive gives specific penalty options in this regard. One key area, however, was offences committed on the Internet. Here ‘grooming’ is now made punishable. It is also important that all Member States are obliged to take measures to get websites containing child pornography deleted. However, in addition to this there remains an important requirement for all institutions of the European Union, in their international cooperation with other states, to ensure that the principle of deletion should take precedence in other countries of the world, too. A great deal of abuse takes place in real life in our children’s immediate environment. Therefore, prevention mechanisms are particularly important, as is instruction in the use of media, so that, when using new media, our children and young people are able to recognise the sources of danger. Protection measures are obviously particularly important from the point of view of those affected, both for children during criminal proceedings and also in the form of special support for children and their families outside the context of such proceedings. The Member States have a particular duty here. Overall, after difficult negotiations, we have obtained a good directive. Following its adoption, it will be up to the Member States to implement it and put it into practice as quickly and as comprehensively as possible. To finish I would like to make one more personal comment. Even though a different decision has now been taken, I would have liked there to be correlation tables for all directives in future. The fact that we will not now have this quick overview of the implementation of measures is something that I personally find very disappointing. Birgit Sippel,

 Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, PNR data is nothing new – after all this information has been gathered since commercial aviation was in its infancy. Likewise, the use of this data, for example for border control purposes, is nothing new. Nonetheless, a problem arises here which is also familiar in other areas: in an increasingly mobile world with modern information technology, data is available in quite different dimensions than was the case 50 or even 30 years ago. This is also the reason why data protection is becoming increasingly important. We have achieved a great deal with this agreement: a clear definition of potential uses, good data protection standards and clear rules for legal certainty and judicial remedy. The changeover from the pull system to the push system is also important. Data is not simply collected, but is sent to Australia. We have not been able to achieve all our demands, however. One of the major points at issue from our perspective is the five-and-a-half-year retention period. We would have liked to see a much shorter period. So, what can we do about it? Do we vote in favour of the agreement or do we reject it? I would like to make two comments. We will never achieve one hundred per cent of our demands. So, we need to weigh things up. Data would continue to be transferred even if we rejected the agreement, however then we would have no clear rules on how this data should be handled. That is why I hope that this agreement will receive majority support tomorrow, despite many reservations. In relation to the forthcoming agreement with the US, I would like to state clearly: we want an agreement here too, but a 15-year retention period is a much longer time. I genuinely fail to see why we cannot change over completely to the push system here. We need to make improvements in this area. We want uniform standards for all agreements in relation to PNR data, rather than a patchwork of arrangements in which the rights of our citizens are dealt with in different ways. Birgit Sippel  (S&amp;D

Madam President, the new mandate for Frontex is a contribution to bringing about the situation whereby, whilst our borders are given the necessary protection, human rights are observed and those seeking protection actually receive it. There are many areas where I would have liked to have seen something better, for example, when it comes to independent observers. Yet whatever you may think of this new mandate, the situation will remain a patchwork. In all the criticism of Frontex – including the justified criticism – one point is often overlooked, and that is the participation and responsibility of the Member States in their collaboration with the agency. Unfortunately, they are not something that we can reform! It would be an important further step though, if we could finally, for example, put in place a uniform and improved European asylum system. The new Frontex mandate may be a step in the right direction, but critical follow-up continues to be absolutely necessary. The discussion about protecting our borders and about the rights of refugees will not be concluded simply as a result of this new mandate. Birgit Sippel

 Madam President, I must admit to the House that I am a little confused where the debate on passenger name records (PNR) is concerned, because the facts and the issues that need to be clarified are not new. Nonetheless, one gets the impression that we are not making any progress – worse still, that we are moving back to worse conditions than those previously agreed. The signing of the agreement with Australia is currently also stalled because the Member States have asked for more time to review it. I fear that the reality is somewhat different, but I would like to hope that this has something to do with the fact that the Member States, too, have realised that not every means is justified in the fight against terror. As most of us here will remember, negotiations on the SWIFT Agreement were very difficult, but were eventually brought to a successful conclusion. I am astonished that we are now moving at a different level as regards data protection and data security, and I get the impression that we are back to standards below those that we have agreed previously. A retention period of 15 years is far too long. In the case of the 11 September 2001 attack that was so incisive for the US, for example, 15-year-old data would have been no help whatsoever because the perpetrators were much too young for data that was so old to have had any relevance. In my view, there is a very close link between proportionality and the use of data for a particular purpose. You cannot collect millions of data records from innocent citizens for 15 years and then say: ‘Actually, we are going to use this data for everything’, as is currently stated in the text of the US agreement. That is not acceptable. I would like to make it quite clear that this requirement applies not just to the US, but also to the Commission and to our Member States. If you adopt a measure to fight terrorism and serious international crime, then this measure must be limited to precisely that and cannot be expanded to allow other areas to be included by the back door.

 Madam President, in the debate on the Hungarian constitution, we heard more than once the criticism that it was a political debate. I am completely taken aback by that, because having political debates is one of the things that Parliament is expressly there to do; and I therefore want to start this topic by setting out the political framework too. Crime, and organised crime in particular, has never been held back by borders or border controls. It therefore makes no sense to rebuild borders in Europe and to restrict the way our populations are growing together. On the contrary: what we need is the consistent further development of cooperation between our Member States and cross-border cooperation by the police and justice authorities. In this area, the European Arrest Warrant has repeatedly proven itself to be an important and successful instrument. At the same time, however, this instrument will fall into disrepute if European Arrest Warrants are used for, say, stolen bicycles, or merely in order to carry out questioning. I regret to say that we have also found that it is being used when perhaps it has been decided not to execute an arrest warrant because there is evidence to show that it was unjustly issued and this is then not respected by the issuing Member State – resulting in the unfortunate situation in which the citizens concerned are repeatedly arrested whenever they cross a border. That does nothing to help build confidence in European legal systems. Why is this happening? Does the text of the directive leave too much leeway? Is it a matter of incorrect implementation in the Member States or inadequate information? We need to clarify these points, the Member States need to make improvements where necessary, and the Commission must take action to prevent such misuse. That is the only way to prevent a successful instrument being permanently damaged and confidence in these measures being lost. Moreover, all these experiences show how important it is that we finally make some progress on the road map for procedural rights. In the interests of legal certainty for everyone involved, we need to have the same rights across Europe for those accused of offences and there must be mandatory information on these rights. I call on the Commission to exert pressure to counter possible opposition on all these points; I am sure it can count on the support of Parliament in this.

 I am not sure whether I should answer your question, as it is more of a polemic comment. However, the figures show that the European Arrest Warrant is an appropriate instrument for fighting crime in the unified space of Europe. Crime is not national; crime is international and crosses borders. That is why we need to cooperate across borders. We need to deal with the teething problems of the European Arrest Warrant and stop it being misused. As an instrument, however, it is indispensable. Birgit Sippel,  
on behalf of the S&amp;D Group.

Madam President, in a globalised world, terrorism and crime are, unfortunately, also globally organised, and therefore we know that we need to cooperate internationally and need to exchange data. I am very pleased to hear that both the Commission and the Council consider that citizens’ rights and data protection are both matters to be accorded very high priority. However, that does not mean that Parliament can rest on its laurels, since issues such as retention periods, data volumes and purpose limitation, as well as controls and whether protective clauses can really be implemented in the area of data protection, will remain critical points. In this sensitive area, what we need is not blind checks, but more trust. The terms on which data is exchanged must therefore also be set at a particularly high level, since it is not just a matter of specific agreements with Australia and the US; a number of other countries such as Korea and India also already want to have PNR agreements with us. For this reason, too, it is very important that we build in particularly high security standards at this point. The same applies to the forwarding of data to third countries. Here again, we must examine very carefully the terms that we want to incorporate. At the same time, when discussing PNR data, we also need to look beyond this. What is the point of keeping the volume of data as low as possible when negotiating on PNR if the US, as a countermove, announces that it wishes not only to levy an entry fee, but also to collect additional data from passengers? We also have a problem within the European Union. What is the point of agreeing the highest possible standards and attempting to limit data volumes if, at the same time, bilateral agreements are being concluded without us having any knowledge of their content and security standards? Mrs Malmström has said that this is not about PNR data, but rather that all data that is collected should apparently serve the purpose of fighting terrorism and combating crime. I would therefore like to end by making one more request: what we need is not just good provisions on the individual measures, but also at last to take an overall view of all the measures, all the data that is transferred by the EU and the Member States. We need to be quite clear about this: we will never achieve one hundred percent security, however many measures we take and however much data we collect. That is a fact that we have to face up to.

 Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, the Treaty of Lisbon has been mentioned many times today. I should like to say something positive about it for once. Most of our citizens think it is a good thing that we can travel in Europe without borders, that we can move freely about Europe for the purposes of education, work and leisure. However, in so doing, we naturally leave a data trail behind us. For a long time now, our data has not just been stored in one Member State, but is spread throughout the European Union. That is precisely why it is a good thing that we have greater powers at European level in this area – which concerns the protection of data relating to European citizens – because our citizens quite rightly expect their data to be well protected everywhere in Europe and they do not expect large amounts of data to be passed on unnecessarily, possibly even to third countries. How are we, as the European Union – and I will make myself absolutely clear: as the European Parliament and Council; in other words, together with the Member States – supposed to ensure this protection if it is the case that while we, as the European Union, are negotiating with third countries on the forwarding of data – over what data is actually required, the purpose for which it is to be used and the safeguards that are necessary in order to protect this data – at the same time, individual Member States are negotiating with third countries on data? Especially since we do not even know what data they are talking about, what security standards are being maintained, whether duplicate data is possibly being forwarded, or even whether data is being forwarded that we would not allow to be forwarded at European level. There is also another aspect that the Member States are perhaps not taking into sufficient consideration. If a Member State negotiates with a third country, how then can I ensure – how can and will the individual Member State ensure – that only the data of its own citizens is, in fact, forwarded, if any data is forwarded at all? We now have databases within the European Union that collect data on all kinds of citizens at a central point and to which many authorities in European countries have access. In other words, if my data is stored somewhere in country A and country A decides to forward data, will my data also be forwarded to a third country? This cannot be the added value in the European Union that was intended when, for good reason, we negotiated the Treaty of Lisbon. The Member States, too, need to take note of the new balance of power between the institutions, must act accordingly, and must stick to the rules, which state that data protection is a European matter. We need to ensure at European level that as little data as possible is forwarded and only for narrowly defined purposes, and that this is not all undermined by bilateral initiatives.

Madam President, in his introduction, the rapporteur said that Parliament now has to support the agreement. Perhaps that was a mistranslation, but I will nevertheless make it very clear that I do not have to support this agreement and I most definitely will not support it. This first agreement following the entry into force of the Treaty of Lisbon will, in particular, send out a particularly important signal. However, what sort of signal are we sending out to the EU and beyond? Looking at the supporters of the agreement I can, above all, see a biblical principle at work: we wash our hands in innocence – after all, we have a treaty. However, we have absolutely no idea what happens to the people in these countries when we send them back. I would have liked to have seen a greater sensitivity to the issue of the treatment of refugees and of respect for human rights. The adoption of this agreement will severely jeopardise our credibility in matters of democracy and human rights. I would therefore ask all my fellow Members once again not to support this agreement. Birgit Sippel  (S&amp;D

 Mr President, a preliminary remark. To accept or to reject, either decision is worthy of respect. What is not acceptable, however, are certain exaggerations, half-truths and falsehoods, frequently devoid of any knowledge of the facts, which have also been voiced in the published debate. More objectivity and less emotion would surely have been fitting. To come to the point, fighting terrorism is just as much about the defence of democratic values and freedoms. One of these also requires the use of data, while the other requires a high degree of data protection. It is precisely here that, under pressure from the European Parliament, we were able to achieve a great deal: verification that a request is actually founded on a legitimate suspicion of terrorism, and daily checks by EU officials in the US Treasury Department that only data pertaining to suspected terrorists are being examined, including the possibility of stopping the extraction of data. We in Parliament are convinced that this important function must be regulated in agreement with all institutions. Compliance with standards, with the involvement of the Data Protection Officers, must be reviewed annually, and, for a storage period of five years, an annual audit to ensure that data which is not required is deleted in good time. To reiterate, intra-European transfers are not affected. Nonetheless, not everything was achieved. For example, Europol. I should like to ask the European Commission not to wait until 2013, but to prepare draft legislation quickly which ensures parliamentary control by means of codecision. Birgit Sippel,  
on behalf of the S&amp;D Group.

Mr President, I would like to contradict those who have spoken so far on one point: I am not interested in arriving at an agreement as soon as possible, but in achieving one that is as good as possible. Quality must come before timeframe. I would like to make one other preliminary remark. The European Parliament has already rejected an agreement once and one aspect among the many reasons relating to content was the lack of European Parliament participation. In view of current events this week, we have decided not to adopt any decisions here in Parliament. Then there is the decision to call on the Council to likewise postpone its decisions until we can adopt our decisions. I am now rather surprised that there are Members of the House, who clearly do not take their own decisions seriously but think: well yes, despite this, the Council can simply decide. I do not think we can treat our own decisions like that. I still maintain that the Council should also withhold its decision until after 6 May when we have decided. I am sure there are no disadvantages to this and that the United States would be understanding. As for the draft mandate itself, I take a favourable view of the fact that the Commission is committed to meeting our demands. Nevertheless, I would like to say clearly that there still need to be substantial amendments to this negotiating mandate. These are necessary if a majority of the European Parliament is to vote in favour of a new agreement. In my opinion, the current mandate is not ambitious enough to achieve this. The problem of bulk data transfer remains unresolved. If the US authorities tell us that every month we are talking about the specific details of five to ten people, then the transfer of millions of pieces of data relating to European citizens is surely disproportionate to this purpose. Incidentally, I would like to say again to the Commission and the Council that although it is constantly maintained that this agreement will be highly significant as an additional means of combating terrorism, the proof of this is not as clear as we are always being told. The long period of retention of data in the United States also continues to be a problem. The mandate does not offer a solution here either. We need a judicial authority on European soil that not only checks the legality of US applications, but also the extraction of data, wherever this takes place. The transmission of information to third countries must be regulated with clear directives. We need an ambitious mandate with our demands. Only then can we achieve a really good result that meets our demands, taking into account data protection as well as the fight against terror. Finally, I have another specific question for the Council and the Commission. How do you intend to ensure that only data that was specifically requested is extracted and passed on? How can that work? In the United States? Or are there other proposals? Birgit Sippel,  
on behalf of the S&amp;D Group.

Madam President, there are a few basic things I would like to say about this agreement. There are, by all means, similarities with SWIFT, but also differences. If the European Parliament had to vote today on the Passenger Name Record (PNR) agreement, we would have no other option but to vote no. That is quite clear. There are still significant objections to this agreement. I will go into the details once more shortly. That is why I was not happy when we spoke about postponing the vote. However, unlike SWIFT, there were definitely good reasons for this postponement. Nevertheless, I will say quite clearly that, for us, it does not mean that the vote can be postponed indefinitely, so that we now have a provisional agreement for years on end. It is very important to us that we quickly reach a new negotiating mandate and, if possible, before the summer break, so that we can quickly gain clarity in detailed questions on how we should handle this data and what data should be included. Data protection plays an important role and here, I would like to use the opportunity to address once again the question as to what data should be transmitted. PNR covers 19 individual pieces of data. I know from conversations I have had that it is of course possible – if you want to – to create personality profiles from these pieces of data. Now, of course, those with whom we have such an agreement are saying they have no interest in this, they will not do it and that relevant data is erased. However, if certain data that could be used to create a personality profile is not used at all, then we must consider whether it should indeed be collected, or – if we reach an agreement – whether all of the data needs to be transmitted. That is a crucial question. We also have to check what level of protection is afforded to data that is transmitted. We know that the regulations in both agreements with the USA and Australia are very different. With a view to further requests by other countries that want to have similar agreements, we should ensure that every time we reach an agreement, special standards apply. We also have to consider in detail the question of how this data is to be used. Originally, it was always said that it was about combating terrorism. Now however, it is also about serious crime. This can be discussed. However, we must go into great detail here. We know that even within the European Union itself, legal systems and legal culture vary greatly. This may mean that the definition of what constitutes a serious crime is completely different in terms of the type of crime. That means we need to look again in detail at what we are discussing when we say that serious crime should also naturally be included. I hope that in future, with the implementation of the agreement, we ensure that there is a regular exchange of information between the institutions. The President-in-Office of the Council has indicated that there has been a first review as far as the agreement with the USA is concerned. Officially, we still do not have these results yet. That was in February. In future, I would not only like to see reports being drawn up regularly, I would also like to see these reports actually being made available to the European Parliament immediately. It is very important to create a uniform agreement. The issue of data must be reviewed again. However, I believe that, on the basis of the previous discussion, we will probably reach a good agreement, and I therefore view further negotiations as something entirely positive. Birgit Sippel  (S&amp;D

 Mr President, anyone who has followed the many discussions about SWIFT over recent weeks might get the impression that without SWIFT, we would descend into chaos and that rejecting the agreement would bring an end to the transatlantic relationship and the joint war on terror. These attempts to threaten us can be described in one word: ridiculous. The US and the Council are not trying to rescue an essential tool; they are simply saving face. There are many agreements and measures in place to combat terrorism. SWIFT could be a useful addition to these. The failed attack on 25 December has clearly demonstrated that it is not data we are lacking, but the ability to make effective use of the data which we already have. The idea is to divert attention away from this fact. The interim agreement simply could not be worse. It is full of contradictions and inconsistencies. Instead of suitable precautions being taken to ensure that only data relating to people who are actually under suspicion is transferred, huge volumes of data will be sent to the US every month. The agreement represents a flagrant breach of citizens’ rights, data protection and the principles of the rule of law. If the Council and the US were really prepared to take on board this criticism and to incorporate these points into a new agreement, then there would be no need for us to accept this dreadful agreement. In the interests of the citizens, we must say no to the interim agreement and we must start new negotiations immediately, so that we can put in place a really good agreement which acts as an additional, effective tool for combating terrorism and which preserves our fundamental rights.

 Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, we should discuss today’s debate, and particularly the decisions which follow the discussion, not from a formal, but rather a political perspective. Uniform standards for laboratory work are, of course, also important for cooperation between the police and the judiciary that is based on trust. However, there are many aspects of this matter which time does not permit us to discuss. In principle, however, the core issue is altogether different, namely how seriously the political acteurs
 take the Treaty of Lisbon, the rights of the Parliament and the citizens, as well as the trustworthy cooperation of the Council and the Parliament. I would like to give three examples: the Treaty of Lisbon describes the High Representative as a strong voice for Europe, and it is a great shame that the Member States have clearly also applied different criteria in this case. The agreement on SWIFT codes, which is controversial in many ways, could once again be subjected to careful scrutiny by the European Parliament next Monday. Instead, it is to be quickly ticked off the list a few hours beforehand and signed with the United States. We are facing the same situation with the topics we are dealing with here. Shortly before the Treaty of Lisbon enters into force, we are being asked to quickly push through decisions, which include provisions for the future which will limit our scope for making decisions, or at least significantly restrict them. We have to ask ourselves why this is the case, as it was certainly possible to submit new proposals on other issues. The Council’s and the Commission’s stance lost them the chance to send a clear message to the people of Europe, a sign of commitment to implementing the treaty, a sign of a democratic Europe of the citizens. We, the European Parliament, have only one option: we must reject these proposals, as we want a broad public debate and we want to use our strengthened rights to support the citizens now, rather than in the near or more distant future.

 Mr President, this morning we have talked a great deal about targeted growth in the European Union. The cohesion policy is a European investment programme that we have at our disposal for creating growth. For this reason, we need at least as much money in the future budget as we have had available to date. The Friends of Cohesion are not against better spending of the money. However, I am not sure whether the friends of better spending in the Council really want good cohesion policy, which is something we need in order to overcome the crisis. There is a second point I would like to mention. In the negotiation box, which has also been mentioned frequently here, 90% of all points in the area of cohesion policy are basically decided with the European Parliament in the ordinary legislative procedure. Please would you accept that this time, for the first time, Parliament is involved in the ordinary legislative procedure for all areas of cohesion policy. The negotiations in committee will be complete in mid-July. We will then have a mandate and be able to negotiate. I hope that the Council will be prepared to do the same at that time. Constanze Angela Krehl,

 Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, it has so often been said that small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs) lie at the heart of the European Union’s economy and this is indeed the case. We are doing a great deal for them. I believe that this is something really special because, in contrast to other large economic areas, we have smaller companies which are competitive on global markets and which are flexible enough to adapt to changing conditions. That is the special feature of SMEs in the European Union and we are providing them with support. They are at the centre of our structural policy not just in the next subsidy period, but also here and now. We have done a lot to ensure that they can access the money from the Structural Funds more easily. However, I believe that there is potential for further improvement and simplification in this area. When a small company applies for a loan at favourable interest rates, it should not be necessary for the company to fill out reams of forms. I think that there is still room for improvement here. However, I also believe that by means of an intelligent initiative, we can encourage SMEs to create closer links between economic growth, an innovative approach to economic development and the struggle to reduce youth unemployment levels. Mr Hahn said in a previous debate that if every company in Europe were to hire just one young person, the problem of youth unemployment would effectively go away. He is right to a certain extent. I am not trying to say that we should insist that money from the European Union will only be made available when companies take on one or two young people. That sort of approach reminds me of my past in the German Democratic Republic, which was also unable to resolve this sort of problem. However, I think it is worth considering how we can establish an intelligent project that could be subsidised by the European Union and would give young people real opportunities for training followed by jobs within companies. Perhaps we will be able to make progress in this area in time for the next subsidy period. However, I must make it clear that I do not want to see merely windfall effects for companies. There must be lasting growth and a lasting reduction in unemployment. I do have one request for the Commission. I know that the Commission is currently reviewing competition law. It would be very helpful in this respect if we could ensure that regions are not pulled apart and that the subsidy conditions in one region are not completely different from those in another. This would lead to more bureaucracy and make access to subsidy funding much more difficult. I hope that the Commission can come up with a positive proposal in this area which will not result in the regions being torn apart. Constanze Angela Krehl  (S&amp;D
),

Targeted investment in business, infrastructure and renewable energies will be required in Greece in order to get the country back on its feet. This is precisely the purpose of the funds provided for under European cohesion policy. In order to implement our projects, however, we need money from private investors. These are unable to raise the necessary loans at present, however, because the banks mostly view any investment in Greece as too risky. That is why I believe we should use part of the funds already allocated to Greece to secure such loans. The banks can rest assured that they will get their money back, while investors will get their much-needed loans and can therefore participate in EU projects, enabling Greece to create several thousand jobs. The advantage of the report is also that it enables very efficient use of the precious funding that is available: by simply using these resources to secure the risk, we can generate more investment than if the money were to be invested directly in projects. Finally, this report makes one thing clear: the European Union is right behind Greece and private investors can rely on this fact. Constanze Angela Krehl,  
on behalf of the S&amp;D Group
. – (DE) 
Madam President, Commissioner, I would like to make three brief points in response to this oral question. First of all, I very much welcome the fact that the Commission wants to put tackling youth unemployment at the heart of its policy. Giving hope and a future to young people is part of our remit and it is very important to us. Secondly, I also welcome the fact that the Commission is increasingly realising that, in a time of economic crisis more than ever, cuts are not the only route to success: we also need investment. In that respect, SMEs should, of course, be our topmost priority, because they create the most jobs and are very important for economic development. Thirdly, let me be very clear and open about this: it appears, from what is being said in the media, that Mr Barroso has been giving the impression that he is able to stump up EUR 82 billion for this European Union, with the throwaway comment afterwards that that money will no longer be spent as planned in the cohesion policy, anyway; we will, instead, be able to use that money right away to do precisely what we have just been talking about: namely, tackling youth unemployment and supporting SMEs. EUR 82 billion – that is almost a quarter of the total cohesion policy budget up to 2013. As far as I am aware, that money is already tied up in programmes and projects. How exactly do you intend to go about this: that is, allowing all the regions, all of a sudden, to start doing something completely different with that money and, then, because the youth unemployment figures are not so high in your neck of the woods, making some of that money available to other countries? The regions have responded to this with dismay. I have received a lot of calls from people asking me: what is going on? Is the money being taken away from us? What is the point of that? Let me give you a word of warning. The cohesion policy has really been a tremendously successful policy and one that has been extremely tangible and comprehensible to citizens. It creates trust. If we now start making vague statements like this, which create the impression that we have money left over, that our policy so far has not been adequate, or that we can rustle up a couple of billion just like that, that will not create any additional trust, but only uncertainty. Most importantly, when I consider the fact that the Council has failed to provide the full amount of funds considered necessary by the Commission and Parliament for this year’s budget negotiations and the fact that, according to the information I have received, some EUR 15 billion are needed this year for projects that have already been completed, but we only have EUR 5 billion, at the very most, at our disposal, then I really wonder how anyone can go around implying that Member States are prepared to fork out more money and allocate additional funds for the cohesion policy. I think that we need to be careful that we actually pursue the right policy and that we offer support to countries with high youth unemployment. However, I would also like us to ensure that we do not create even more uncertainty for people in times that are difficult enough already. Constanze Angela Krehl  (S&amp;D
).

 Mr President, there is broad agreement both in Parliament and in the Commission on the future importance of cohesion policy for all the regions in Europe. I would like to ask Mr Hahn how the Commission intends to ensure that genuine flexibility within the regions can be guaranteed, given the differences between the regions and their different levels of growth, if everything is being controlled with great precision under the terms of the regulations and there is hardly any scope to accommodate the specific features of each region. Constanze Angela Krehl  (S&amp;D

 Does this mean that a region which has already introduced extensive energy efficiency measures will not be forced to do so, but could instead invest in research facilities and that this could be laid down in the partnership contract? Constanze Angela Krehl,  
on behalf of the S&amp;D Group
. – (DE) 
Madam President, cohesion policy is a successful European policy which everyone makes use of, including regions which are not as well developed and those which already have a strong economy. A variety of studies have demonstrated this. However, most importantly, the citizens of Europe can experience its benefits at first hand. This is why we need cohesion policy in future in all the regions of the European Union. Nevertheless, we are under an obligation to make our good policies even better. This is what the European Parliament is aiming to achieve with Mr Pieper’s report. Modern cohesion policy means facing the new challenges, creating up-to-date infrastructure, combating climate change, supporting energy security and efficiency, promoting research and development, providing support for small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs) and creating jobs. Of course, we also need to ensure that the funding is used efficiently. Therefore, we are making it clear that cohesion policy must be more transparent and results-oriented and must involve less red tape. The coordination between the various funds and programmes must also be improved, as Mr Stavrakakis said earlier. One very important point is that the partnership principle must be taken to a new and better level. We must involve everyone, including the regions, local areas, both sides of industry and major non-governmental organisations. The new intermediate category remains controversial. We are of the opinion that the intermediate category will help regions which need more support than the classic Objective 2 regions. They will not be funded at the expense of other regions. On the contrary, the result will not be a patchwork of subsidies. Instead the many phasing-in and phasing-out procedures will be standardised and I believe that this is something which we really need in the European Union. Anyone who thinks that we are introducing a permanent subsidy category is underestimating the European Parliament. Over the past few years we have demonstrated often enough that we are able to bring in community initiatives when they are needed. However, we have also worked jointly to remove them again once the objective has been achieved. We are competent enough to be able to judge at the end of a subsidy period whether the results are good and how we should redesign the programme. Therefore, I am calling on my fellow Members to support this new intermediate category when it comes to the vote. Constanze Angela Krehl,  
rapporteur for the opinion of the Committee on Regional Development.
 – (DE)
 Mr President, cohesion policy accounts for one of the largest individual budgets in the European Union. We need to develop a new policy that is adapted to the new challenges. We want investment in a modern infrastructure, in research, innovation and the development of new technologies. We want sustainable, integrated urban development and we want a well-educated workforce. The regions need specific subsidies to help them to become competitive and to develop economically. However, at the same time, it must be said that all regions must have access to cohesion policy, both Eastern European Member States and strong national economies like Germany. Eastern Germany requires support. However, some western German regions require European aid, as do parts of the United Kingdom. This requires a budget that should be no smaller than the current one and that cannot be split into different sectors. We must make every effort to improve efficiency and transparency and we must link this with an abandonment of unnecessary bureaucracy. Cohesion is linked with solidarity. However, cohesion is also sensible from an economic point of view and necessary. A lack of cohesion is bad news, even for strong national economies. For this reason, we should provide appropriate financial backing for cohesion policy. I would like to thank the rapporteur for including the opinion of the Committee on Regional Development in his report and I would ask for support for the amendment for once again improving the intermediate categories. We have reached a compromise in the Committee on Regional Development and I would recommend that this House should incorporate the compromise found by the specialist politicians in the Garriga Report. I would ask for your broad support. Constanze Angela Krehl,  
on behalf of the S&amp;D Group.

 Mr President, Commissioners, ladies and gentlemen, in the European Union, cohesion policy means that we aim to lend our support to the weaker regions. It is an expression of major European solidarity. Solidarity, however, is never a one-way street, and my group therefore backs the principle that all the regions of the European Union must be able to participate in our cohesion policy. For us, this also means that we will not support any measures of renationalisation and that we do not want to see cohesion policy fragmented into sector-based policy approaches. We do not need any extra transport or climate protection or energy efficiency funds, but we do need to work on how we reconcile the challenges we face with a sound cohesion policy. It is therefore clear to us that, alongside a strong Objective 1 area, we also need a strong Objective 2 area, and appropriate transitional rules. One thing is for certain, and that is that regions need our support at the European level. The European Union needs strong regions, too, and there is therefore a give and take in both directions. Of course, we need to review our priorities – clearly, we do need greater efficiency. My group is therefore four-square behind the proposal, in order, for example, to be able to coordinate rural development much better together under the umbrella of cohesion policy than in the past. Of course, we also back improving infrastructure, supporting businesses and supporting sustainable economic development. However, sustainable economic development is only possible if we bring the employed – the people – with us. In other words, we need employment policy approaches, we need education, we need training, we need people to integrate into the labour market. That, in turn, is only possible in collaboration with the European Social Fund, under the umbrella of cohesion policy. We support this, but with dedicated rules, which there did used to be in the past. We need to really make an effort to improve this and significantly strengthen the social side of cohesion policy. In the forthcoming discussions and negotiations, my group will be going in to bat for improving and simplifying the usability of the fund. We need a simplification of the application processes so that, first of all, fewer errors are made, and, secondly, so that access for those people who really want to work can be made easier through this European cohesion policy. We will strive to ensure that, in these negotiations, a stronger partnership principle really is implemented. I believe that Parliament’s role has been strengthened now that the Treaty of Lisbon is in force. My group will be arguing the case for this partnership principle. Constanze Angela Krehl  (S&amp;D

– (DE)
 Mr President, the current Cohesion policy started life with the title of the Lisbon Strategy. However, I firmly believe that the Cohesion policy can, and will, make an enormous contribution to the Europe 2020 strategy, not just because we command a considerable budget in comparison with other European policies but, above all, because the Cohesion policy allows us to have sustainable development in our regions and ensures good monitoring of the restructuring processes and challenges in our regions. However, there is one core issue here that I would like to clarify once again, and that goes for our group as well: our Cohesion policy can only work if economic development is considered to be equally as important as social development and providing training for workers. In principle, we need to take joint responsibility for the funds that are available to us. It is a bit like hardware and software – one cannot work without the other. Constanze Angela Krehl,

 Mr President, I am very sorry that Mr Kirilov cannot present the report himself. He has worked very hard to draw up a report for Parliament on a subject which is very important for the regions and the citizens of the European Union. Therefore, I would like to read out his notes. They are in English, which is very surprising for a Bulgarian Member. However, it is a good thing that I do not have to speak Bulgarian. I am very pleased that I can represent him here in Parliament, even though he was unable to get a flight in Sofia.  Mr President, I am glad that this evening we have the opportunity to discuss important amendments to the Structural Funds general regulation. These modifications are a substantial element of the common efforts at European and national level to overcome the consequences of the economic crisis. They are a logical continuation of the documents which we adopted last year. Then, as the rapporteur on the role of the cohesion policy for investment in the real economy, I called on the Council and Commission to work for simplification of the Structural Funds rules and thus facilitating access to these funds when they are more needed by the Member States. I am happy that Parliament’s main recommendations for further simplification have been taken on board. I am convinced that the new changes to the general regulations, simplifying some of the existing procedures, deserve our support. Reducing unnecessary administrative burden, red tape and unclear rules will contribute to more transparency, better control and fewer irregularities. This also means improved implementation and correct spending on EU money. Here is just one example. Through the amendment of Article 88, the Member States are further stimulated to detect and correct irregularities before they are found by the EU controlling institutions. In this case, the Member States will not lose the affected money but will be able to use them again for other projects within the relevant programme. The second group of amendments concern financial management rules. Advance payments for countries worst hit by the crisis will be increased for 2010. All Member States will receive more time to spend 2007-committed funds for projects which have not been approved or implemented within the deadlines. Both groups of measures are important because of their message to the beneficiaries and because of their practical utility. Anti-crisis measures are a clear demonstration of solidarity. They will bring fresh money for the Member States to get out of the crisis. All measures will commit realisation of more projects, especially now. This is crucial for the creation of jobs, investment and infrastructure and adaptation of workers and firms to the economic change. Both types of measures are useful and more valuable if they are implemented at the right time, but they are still awaiting final approval. Unfortunately, there was a huge delay in the Council for reaching an agreement when it was the leading body for the adoption of the amended regulation. I strongly believe that now, when Parliament has the same power as the Council, we will not postpone any more the approval and entry into force of these long-awaited and needed measures.

 Mr President, this is certainly not a nice reason for this debate. Madeira has been hit by an unbelievable natural disaster and we extend our condolences to the families affected. The European Union must provide support in this situation. The solidarity of the whole of the European Union is required here and I can only reiterate what has already been said. I urge the Commission to mobilise the Solidarity Fund as quickly as possible so that help can be provided. I would like to ask the Council to ensure that the reform of the Solidarity Fund that Parliament adopted two years ago is finally implemented, because this will make it possible to provide assistance more quickly to the regions affected. We also need to look to the future. In recent years, Madeira has received a lot of structural fund resources and will also continue to do so over the next few years. These resources need to be used to take preventative action so as to be able to reduce the terrible consequences of natural disasters and therefore also the suffering. This is something that, as the European Union, we need to implement in the regions and therefore also in Madeira. Constanze Angela Krehl,

Madam President, the Group of the Progressive Alliance of Socialists and Democrats in the European Parliament supports the initiative for the development of a strategy for the Danube Region. This is an important project to us, also because it strengthens, in an exemplary manner, territorial cohesion, which has been included for the first time in the Treaty of Lisbon, and may also provide an opportunity to make it clear exactly what we understand by territorial cohesion. I hope that Mr Rehn has also told the many partners he has spoken to that the European Parliament will be duly involved in drawing up the common strategy for the Danube Region. Unfortunately, I did not hear the words European Parliament in your speech, but we will duly take part in the debate. I am pleased that we are having the first major debate here in plenary today. In addition to territorial cohesion, it is also important to make it clear that this strategy involves cross-border cooperation, something that we are always encouraging and have always supported in the area of cohesion policy, and in fact already wanted to increase during this funding period. I hope that this will have even greater success in the next few years, including in connection with the Danube Strategy. I would like to point out that, with this Danube Strategy, we will attain European added value, which will be really tangible, particularly for the people living in this region. They should, therefore, be directly involved in drawing up the strategy and they should also be given the opportunity to witness this European project. My earnest request is that we do not overload and burden the strategy with too many priorities, but that we focus on what we want to achieve. In my opinion, it is very important that we use the existing resources more efficiently and that we build or expand warning systems, for example, and set them up appropriately to warn of natural disasters such as floods, but also to respond in the event of industrial accidents, for example, which result in the pollution of the Danube and neighbouring regions. Common areas of activity exist here. A successful Danube Strategy and successful projects in this region may also provide models for other regions. Without always having to immediately invent a new strategy, we can use this as an example for resolving problems together in cross-border European cooperation and – if we succeed in actually incorporating third countries into such a strategy – also for putting in place a Neighbourhood Policy, which is something that is important for all of us in the European Union and which should be promoted. Constanze Angela Krehl,  
on behalf of the S&amp;D Group.

 Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, I would have liked to see a more exciting introduction to this topic, because I believe that the European cohesion policy must change after 2013. We are faced with quite different challenges than was the case 10 or 15 years ago. The focus for my group is on the fact that solidarity between the regions is not negotiable. On the one hand, this means that all the regions must have the opportunity to participate in the European Union cohesion policy and, on the other hand, it also means that we must oppose any attempt to renationalise the cohesion policy. We need a European approach which allows citizens to identify with the European Union. For us, there is no question that we also need to change. In the next few years, the spotlight will be on a discussion about prioritising the areas which will receive funding from the European cohesion policy. In future, we will not be able to subsidise everyone with European money. We must focus on establishing effective infrastructures, in particular, in the new Member States, and on developing research and innovation. Of course, we must also bear in mind that in future, the European cohesion policy will have to respond appropriately to challenges such as climate change, demographic change and globalisation. We also need to concentrate on urban development. This is not because I want to neglect rural areas, but because we know that 80% of citizens live in towns, cities and urban hinterlands and because rural development unfortunately does not form part of the cohesion policy at the moment, but is covered by agriculture policy. Our approach is to create stronger networks. I do not yet know whether this will work, but we must rise to the challenge. Importantly, support for people themselves also forms part of the cohesion policy and this is why I regret the fact that the Commissioner’s response was slightly evasive. For us, this means primarily education, training and qualifications for everyone from small children right through to the elderly. Life-long learning is an important concept. However, this also means that the European Social Fund (ESF) must continue to be integrated with the cohesion policy. There must be no thoughts of separating the ESF from the cohesion policy. Cross-border cooperation is very important to us. We want to strengthen this cooperation at the same time as simplifying the bureaucracy involved. Constanze Angela Krehl,  
on behalf of the S&amp;D Group.

Mr President, Mrs Malmström, ladies and gentlemen, I am delighted that the Swedish Presidency has put cooperation in the Baltic Sea area at the top of its agenda. There is no need for argument here: we need to protect resources and we, too, need to help protect the climate and nature. On the other hand, we must also focus cooperation in the Baltic Sea area on economic development, of that there can be no question. You have our full support here. However, some questions do still arise. You just said that there are no additional funds. As we discussed this in committee, all the funds are to be made available under the current cohesion policy. For me, this raises the question of whether this means under existing projects that are already being financed from cohesion resources or under new projects. If so, we need to ask which cohesion policy projects already approved will lose funding. This is a very important point, because I already know that the towns, local authorities and regions will come and ask me, what should we do in order to become involved in the Baltic Sea Strategy? How do we get the funds to run this sort of project? If we do not give them a good answer and cannot indicate how this cooperation is to be organised, then citizens’ enthusiasm for Baltic Sea cooperation will probably quickly turn to frustration. That is not the objective that we are working together to achieve and we therefore need to hold very intensive talks on how to organise this cooperation. I therefore ask – and I would ask the Commissioner to take this on board – that not only the Council and the Commission participate in the Baltic Sea Strategy, but also that Parliament is properly involved in this cooperation and in the implementation of this strategy, because we would like other regions to profit as well, as with the Black Sea policy or with cooperation between the states bordering the Danube. That would be very important to us. Dagmar Roth-Behrendt,  
rapporteur for the opinion of the Committee on Legal Affairs.

Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, where the Council and the Member States are concerned, I often have the feeling, well, I am often reminded of a monitor lizard. Monitor lizards have forked tongues. Perhaps that is too complex a metaphor for the Member States, so let me simply say that they have a split personality. They want to impose more and more new tasks on the European Union – and to some extent we support that with our priorities – but they are not willing to equip the EU with the capacities it needs, in terms of adequate personnel, to perform these tasks. I have heard our fellow Members talking about the different policy areas, such as agriculture, as Mr De Castro has mentioned, but also cultural policy, research, environmental policy, social policy and regional development. These are tremendously important areas for all of the Member States and for the regions which we represent. What strikes me, however, is what the Member States are not doing. They are not considering who is meant to do the work on all of these policies. Who is supposed to process the applications? Who will ensure that the projects are implemented properly and funding is channelled to where it is needed? For that to happen, we need enough staff, and these staff must be properly qualified, highly skilled employees. We need the very best people we can find! We need a multicultural workforce from many different European Union countries, with more geographical balance and outstanding language skills. What does the Council want? What do the Member States want? They want to make cuts here! Unless we have an appropriate financial framework for administrative expenditure, we will not be in a position to work on any policy areas at all. With that in mind, I urge you, President-in-Office, to ensure that the Commission’s proposal on the staff regulations is accepted so that we have an appropriate framework that enables us to carry out this work!

 Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, if we had been this timid during the BSE crisis fifteen years ago, when I was the chair of a committee, we would not have safe beef on which we can now rely. Fifteen years ago, it was self-evident that we would introduce an animal passport and that two ear tags would be mandatory. Today, we are once again hesitant. Do we really need crises in order to make the right decisions? The rapporteur said that this is not about public health, but that is precisely what this is about. This is about health policy, it is about public health. I admit that the introduction of a mandatory electronic identification system does, of course, involve a certain amount of expenditure and effort. I therefore proposed in committee that we should put forward a transitional period of 10 years. Even that, however, was too much for the majority of the committee. Do you want to face your electors earnestly and tell them that you take public health seriously? Not a single farmer would say that they could not achieve this given ten years. Let us turn now to voluntary labelling. In this connection, we have repeatedly said that what we want to do is to urge farmers to connect better with consumers and provide information in which consumers are interested. How old are the animals? How have they lived? How have they been fed? How were they reared? We are providing this option with the voluntary system. It is used in every Member State. The rapporteur is now proposing that we should remove the essential characteristics that provide conditions for how the system is to be operated. That would mean that there would be a system, but no conditions within it. Who seriously believes that something like that can actually work? Not a single national authority would be able to monitor these elements. No one can manage that. In other words, the aim is to destroy an existing system. Fortunately, the majority of the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Food Safety – and the rapporteur must represent that committee here, after all – decided to retain this voluntary system as it is. I would like to ask all my fellow Members to vote in favour of the amendments tabled by that committee when we vote on this tomorrow. Ladies and gentlemen, I do believe, however, that we could consider whether we can simplify this system from an administrative point of view. Then, however, we would have to simplify the system and remove the administrative obstacles and hurdles. We need to help the authorities, but the way proposed here is the wrong way to go. Ladies and gentlemen, I ask you urgently, including in the interests of the consumers and of the farmers of the European Union, to follow the lead of the decisions of the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Food Safety when it comes to voluntary labelling. Dagmar Roth-Behrendt  (S&amp;D

– Madam President, yes it is true that we need more money in the European budget to have programmes to educate about HIV/AIDS and to monitor it. But I wish to ask Ms Parvanova if she agrees with me that Member States are neglecting that disease and that we have different amounts of money spent in Member States – which is a shame, as we heard from Ms Childers – and that it would be necessary to ask the Commission to ask the Member States to show us how much money they spend on education programmes, how much money they spend on treating the disease, on hospices and on helping to eradicate this disease? It would be good if we could ask the new Presidency, the Danish Presidency, to deliver those numbers as soon as possible. Dagmar Roth-Behrendt  (S&amp;D

Madam President, Commissioner, medicinal products are one of the most important things that help people to get healthy, but, at the same time, they pose an enormous risk. Do you agree with me that our approach needs to be more harmonised? Do you agree with me that the ‘notified bodies’ in the Member States do not work well? Do you agree with me that the new legislation that you are going to bring forward over the next year must therefore ensure, on behalf of patients, that there is a body that checks in a uniform and harmonised way whether a medicinal product really is safe for patients? Do you further agree with me that it is necessary, for the wellbeing of patients in the European Union, for us to clearly define the use of any given product – whether on a one-off or repeated basis – and not to leave this in the hands of the industry.

 Mr President, I would have liked my fellow Members to have been slightly braver and to have gone for a second reading and then the conciliation procedure, whatever the Presidency in question. No front-of-pack labelling, no calorie information on the front, no indication at least of the calories in alcohol, never mind any other ingredients, no portion sizes at all, not a spoonful or a cup or anything else. The compromise includes none of these things. The country of origin information, which is something that consumers urgently need to know, is totally inadequate. The content of Article 25, like everything else, is linked to reports from the Commission on the status of the implementation of provisions: reports on trans fats, reports on products with one ingredient, reports on a whole range of other subjects. This really is a resounding failure. It is not a good result and it is very disheartening. I would have liked to have seen a proper second reading and then, if necessary, the conciliation procedure. That would have been a respectable result. Now European consumers will simply be disappointed. Dagmar Roth-Behrendt,

 Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I can no longer count the number of times over the past 14 or 15 years that I have spoken here in Parliament on subjects relating to bovine spongiform encephalopathy (BSE), transmissible spongiform encephalopathies (TSEs), animal health and, most importantly, consumer protection and human health. In 1997 I was the chair of the BSE committee and since then I have had the opportunity to speak perhaps 20, 30 or 40 times on the subject. We have a report here to discuss today and to vote on tomorrow, which concerns another Commission road map. At this point, I would like to thank the Commission, Mr Dalli and his colleagues once again for their cooperation. Over all the years that we have been dealing with BSE, this cooperation has been of a consistently high quality and I am grateful for this. However, this has not always been the case. If the situation in the 1980s and 1990s had been similar, we would have perhaps had fewer problems, but, thank goodness, things have changed over recent years. The road map contains essential technical sections, but it also has sections relating to the content which are important in political terms. I would like to refer to some of them, but I will not be able to cover all of them because of a lack of time. In all of the proposals which I am asking you to accept tomorrow, safeguarding the health of consumers is, of course, the highest priority. In recent years, we have introduced several amendments to the legislation on BSE and TSEs and, rightly so, when you consider that in 2001 we had 2 167 cases of animals with BSE in the European Union, while in 2009 the figure was only 67. This alone shows what a quantum leap forward has been taken in animal health and also in consumer protection. Tomorrow we will have to look at the question of whether we want to continue on this path. I have made a few proposals relating to the content which will also help us to continue reducing the risk of BSE and TSEs. However, I would like to focus here on one proposal and that is the question of the ban on feeding meat and bone meal to omnivores which are not ruminants, in other words, not sheep, goats and cattle. In 2001, in the light of the BSE crisis and the BSE scandal, a ban on feeding meat and bone meal to pigs and poultry in particular was introduced. At no point did this have any scientific basis; it was purely a political decision. At that time we had to admit that contaminated meat and bone meal had been fed to cattle. This was highly unethical because cattle are ruminants and herbivores and should not eat meat and bone meal. This contributed to the BSE crisis and, therefore, there was a complete ban on feeding meat and bone meal which also covered omnivores, in other words, animals which eat animal protein and, in particular, pigs and poultry. I would like to propose to you now, just as the Commission is doing, that we go back and say that if we can produce these products safely, then we must also be able to feed them. There is no point in us eating only about one third of an animal and not eating the rest of the animal which is fit for human consumption, but also not being allowed to reuse it to feed other animals. Therefore, we must amend this regulation. We are importing large quantities of protein crops, soya in particular, from the USA and Brazil, all of which have been genetically modified. That is not an acceptable alternative. We need our own high-quality, safe supply from within the European Union. The manufacturing method used must meet the relevant standards and we must also ensure that no cannibalism occurs. In other words, pigs must only eat meat and bone meal made from poultry and vice versa. The Commission can make sure that this is what happens. I hope that tomorrow, following the very positive cooperation, a large majority will be in favour of taking this next step towards returning the situation to normal. Dagmar Roth-Behrendt,  
rapporteur.
 – (DE)
 Madam President, in conclusion I would like to look at one point and that is the question of the feed ban which was introduced in 2001. I understand the fact that not all of you have been as closely involved with this subject over the last 15 years as I have. However, it is important for you to know that bovine spongiform encephalopathy (BSE) came about because illegal, undeclared feed containing processed ruminant protein was wrongly fed to cattle. In other words, sheep suffering from scrapie made their way into the meat and bone meal and this infected a similar species, namely another ruminant. This report, which I am sure you have all read, and this is directed at Mrs Grossetête, Mrs Rivasi and also Mrs Werthmann, specifically does not state that it will be possible to process ruminants to produce meat and bone meal. Ruminants are specifically excluded. Only pigs and poultry will be processed to make meat and bone meal. Even if the wicked farmers whom Mrs Rivasi mentioned actually exist and even if these nasty farmers do something illegal, in other words, feeding pig meat and bone meal to cattle, nothing would happen to the cattle. Therefore, and you can really believe me, because I will not do anything in relation to BSE and transmissible spongiform encephalopathies (TSEs) without thinking about it in great detail, I am calling on you once again to consider this carefully. Mr Häusling, Mrs Rivasi’s fellow Member, drafted an excellent report on the protein deficit in the European Union. We must not throw away other parts of animals that we eat because we cannot or do not want to process these parts which are fit for human consumption. This is what we did until 2001. The correct reaction at that time would have been to continue using meat and bone meal, but not to process cattle and sheep to produce it. That would have been the sensible solution. However, we rather overshot the mark and took our populist approach a little too far. Now it is time to correct this mistake. In the meantime, 10 years have passed and it is clear that meat and bone meal is a valuable source of protein, just as valuable as soya from Brazil and the USA and perhaps a better solution than creating monocultures in those countries and importing genetically modified plants into the European Union. I am calling on Parliament to take a unified stand tomorrow. I would ask you all to support my proposal. Dagmar Roth-Behrendt  (S&amp;D
). 
 – (DE)
 Mr President, Mr Dalli, your colleagues in the Directorate-General for Health and Consumers and yourself have done everything right. The same cannot be said of the German authorities. The least that we can say is that there is chaos when it comes to communications, and that, perhaps, is putting it mildly. The fact that Germany’s health minister yesterday thought it unnecessary to travel to a Health Council in Luxembourg where the main topic on the agenda was this serious infection crisis shows that he has absolutely no idea what Europe is really about and that he is ignorant, does not recognise the problems, or is still busy with internal party political crises. (Applause)
 What is more, I must observe – and Mr Dalli said it himself – that the German authorities clearly took the view that they would do without European Union experts, patronisingly and arrogantly believing that they had no need for them. Furthermore, the fact that it took three days for these experts to get into Germany is a scandal, and one that we must be critical of in this House. At the same time, however, we also have to say that it is our job, in the European Union, to warn consumers when there is a dangerous foodstuff on the market. I say to you quite clearly – if there are dangerous bacteria on a cucumber or a lettuce that do not lead to death, that may be a good thing, but for me it is not enough to justify a compensation case. Cucumbers from Spain and other countries did have EHEC bacteria on them. They were not the bacteria behind this outbreak, but it takes a while to find that out. For me, that is not the point, either. Those of you who understand the European Union and know the early warning system also know how the early warning system works. You know that, in the early warning system, the product and also the name of the producer must be named. You can also look that up easily in the legislation. For me, the important question is what will happen in future? In the future, we need to consider whether slurry use can continue. Could there still be production methods that are unacceptable? Who, in the European Union, actually monitors what, when and with what result this is documented, and who has what obligations in that regard? (Applause) President. − 
 Thank you very much. To those Members who wish to avail of the ‘catch-the-eye’ procedure, I would say that we already have approximately 20 speeches and that I do not believe we shall have enough time before the vote. However, you are still welcome to try. President.

 Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, we can all imagine the nightmare. Someone we know is ill and in a desperate situation. They are given medicines, but the medicines have no effect, because they have been falsified. We are grateful to the Commission for producing this proposal. It is true that we have been discussing it for some time. We began our debates in the previous parliamentary term and I would like to thank Mr Adamou, who is no longer a Member of this Parliament, for the preliminary work that he did on behalf of Mrs Matias. I believe that we have reached a good compromise, as Mrs Grossetête has said. Yes, we could have gone further. We are all impatient and we all want greater safety, but this is a good compromise. What have we achieved? We have made patient safety the central feature of the legislation. The safety measures that we have put in place will ensure that products are traceable throughout the entire distribution chain. Medicines can be traced from the manufacturer to the pharmacist. They will have an identifier which makes it immediately obvious if they are falsified or duplicated or if there are any irregularities, which can then be followed up. We have deliberately done this in such a way that the costs of the system remain at a reasonable level for everyone involved and that the system is not excessive. However, we are also not compromising on patient safety. This traceability is accompanied by the fact that the packaging must be undamaged, so that a patient who is given a pack can see that it has not been opened because it has an intact seal. In addition, there will be no more packs of medicines which are divided in two, as frequently used to be the case. All of this will improve safety levels and increase patients’ confidence. What else have we achieved? We have implemented an early warning system. This is excellent because it is the same system which has been in place for decades for foods and which we take for granted. There is an early warning system throughout the European Union for contaminated food. It is hard to believe that we have not had the same thing for medicines. If a falsified medicine is discovered, it is now possible to send out an early warning. The Member States must identify the patients who are affected, inform everyone involved and make sure that the risk involved in a medicine which is in circulation is made public. We take this for granted in the case of cars and food, but it has not been available so far for something as essential as medicines. As far as the Internet is concerned, anyone who accesses an illegal website must be able to recognise that it is illegal. This is why we must certify legal websites which, in future, will have a link to the website of the national approval body. They will be able to display a logo which will be developed by the European Commission. Everyone who buys medicines on the Internet can do so independently. They can tell whether they are dealing with a safe, legal website or an illegal one. All of this is a milestone, a quantum leap forward in patient safety. If we adopt this legislation tomorrow, we can be proud of what we have done and we should also make our achievements clear to the general public. President. −

 Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, this legislation is actually superfluous. I hope that it will continue to be superfluous because patients will not need to make use of it. In an ideal world, patients would receive the best healthcare most quickly in the country of their birth or the country where they live. The fact that we are discussing this today and adopting the legislation tomorrow is, as Mr Liese has rightly said, indicative of a cynical approach among the Member States. It means that the Member States have not recognised what they owe to their citizens, in other words, rapid, effective and high quality healthcare. It also shows that they would rather invest in other things than in these areas which provide services for their citizens and that is a disgrace. In addition, the negotiations in the Council on this subject are not something to be proud of. However, if this legislation is actually applied at some point, because patients need it, and that is not a good thing, I will be very pleased about what we have achieved. I am grateful to the rapporteur, Mrs Grossetête, and to my fellow Members for their cooperation. We have achieved a great deal. We have succeeded finally in putting the focus on rare diseases. People with these illnesses have always been sidelined and have found it difficult to obtain any treatment at all. We have at last managed to establish information points in the Member States which will inform people about their rights. There has been nothing of this kind available in the past. If reference networks are set up in future, it will finally be possible for the Member States to share best practices, information about gold and platinum standards and scientific progress. This has not been coordinated until now. There are some individual beacons of excellence, but no coordination. All of these things represent major successes, together with outpatient care and other areas which I will not go into now. Of course, there are also things that make me feel sad. I would have preferred not to have had the fuss and squabbling about prior authorisation, which simply shows that the Member States have not recognised the things that are really important. Fortunately, however, there are some Member States with which we can work well and we have demonstrated that today. Our objective must be to ensure that the healthcare system in every country is so good that no one wants to travel to another country whose language they do not speak. If what we are doing today and tomorrow is a small step towards this, because it will become clearer which countries have good services and which have poor services, which are doing something for their citizens and which are not, then we will have achieved a great deal. I hope that one of the minor side-effects of this will be transparency. We need to know which Member States have high standards and which are at a low level. I come from a country where I can feel relatively relaxed. However, I am aware of the problems of people in many other Member States and I feel ashamed about this, because it is not worthy of the European Union. I would like to thank the rapporteur for her hard work and, in particular, the Commission, Mr Dalli and his team, who have given the European Parliament and the father of this legislation in the previous parliamentary term, Mr Bowis, as much support as we could have wished for. I would also like to thank particularly the Belgian Presidency, which is not present today, but which has done everything possible to ensure that this process was successful. Although the Belgian Presidency did everything in its power, it could not always achieve a great deal, because of the sometimes stubborn, antediluvian attitudes of other Member States. However, something has been done and I believe that we will be able to vote in favour of this legislation tomorrow with a clear conscience. (Applause) President. − 
 Colleagues, just to let the speaker and everybody know what is happening, we now have three more people who want to ask a blue-card question. As this possibility has been introduced by the working group on parliamentary reform, I am very sympathetic to that and we have enough time, but nevertheless I have to ask the speaker if he will take all those questions. Then I would ask everybody whether we can take the questions in turn and then ask Mr Hökmark to answer. We will then finalise that part of the speaking time. President. − 
 Mr Swoboda, I fully support what you have said. It is very rude and lacking in respect. Mr De Rossa, a point of order? President.

 Mr President, let us approach this whole process rather more calmly. Usually, the Vice-Presidents of Parliament are elected in a block at the start of the legislative period or in the course of the legislative period. When we do that, fellow Members, we only ever find out the number of ‘Yes’ votes cast for a candidate – which also decides the order in which Members are elected to the Bureau. Now, because a Member has left, we are voting in one more Vice-President today – so the only important thing is whether he has received the number of ‘Yes’ votes required for election. Anything else makes no difference. It is different to other votes. (Applause)
 The President of Parliament has given a perfect description of the secret ballot, and it worked beautifully for me without my having to press various buttons. I pressed the button that I wanted to press and the blue light appeared. Perhaps we could simply all try it together once more, Mr President. (Applause) President.

– We have changed the name on the screen, as you have seen. Unfortunately, the Commissioner in question was not able to be with us on time, which I find regrettable, as there is no ash cloud at the moment and as it is already 11.00. Maybe at some point, the Commission could discuss the fact that the competent Commissioners should be here. That, too, is a subject for the framework agreement.

 Mr President, Mr Barroso, our circumstances are different and we have a different institutional structure. Now that the Treaty of Lisbon is in place, the three institutions – Parliament, the Council and the European Commission – will have to work together in a different way to how they have done up to now. I believe that we all need to be interested in making this a success. Your involvement in the first part of the interinstitutional agreement gives me the impression – and I am not always uncritical of you – that you want this, too. The first part of this agreement that we have negotiated with you contains important elements for the role of the European Parliament in our cooperation with you, in particular, but also with the Council. These elements are the strengthening of the dialogue between Parliament and the European Commission, the possibility of receiving more information than we have done in the past, in other words, to be able to be an equal partner in the legislative process, and a genuine question time in which commissioners, who are, ultimately, politicians, come here and answer questions and give speeches and responses, without hiding away as they have done in the past. Previously, only you, Mr Barroso, had the courage to do that. Now, all of them will do so. That is a good thing. It will benefit all of us, and it will also be beneficial for European democracy and, hopefully, also for the interest of citizens in what we do, namely our legislative work for everyone. Finally, Mr Barroso, with regard to the question of legislative initiative, I firmly believe that, with what we were able to achieve in the negotiations with you regarding our cooperation and what we have today shaped into a resolution, we have come as close to the right of initiative for the European Parliament as we possibly can. It furthermore rules out the sui generis
 construct. You worked with us on this and you worked earnestly on it. I respect that and very much appreciate how you have contributed to this. The impact assessments have already been mentioned by other Members. You have undertaken to make this transparent and to act in a cooperative manner. You said that social impact assessments are important to you. That is an essential point from our perspective. I am completely happy with this. I believe that we should begin the work today, and not before time. President.  
– I would remind the Members once again that the Blue Card system created by the Working Party on Parliamentary Reform does not apply to the Commission and the Council, but only to debates amongst Members of this House. A motion for a resolution to close this debate has been tabled by the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Food Safety(1)
. The debate is now closed. The vote will take place tomorrow. President.  
– Thank you very much, Mrs Gräßle. As you are addressing the Commission directly, I would encourage the Commissioner to listen closely to what you have to say. That makes it much easier to answer afterwards. President.  
– Thank you very much, Commissioner Šemeta. There were a few more questions from the Members, but it is my understanding that you do not want to answer Mr Garriga and the other Members directly. Perhaps you would like to get your answers to the Members in question in writing. They would certainly appreciate that enormously. Mrs Gräßle, Mr Garriga and numerous other Members have asked additional questions. President.

 Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, to take Ms Schaldemose’s example, if we imagine that we had a USB stick and every computer had a different access port, we would all have to buy different adaptors. This example alone shows how important standardisation is and the great extent to which it can make life easier for citizens. This is a very important issue that we have to debate here. We, in Parliament, have also succeeded in adding many improvements to the Commission’s text. I would therefore like to offer my sincere thanks to the rapporteur and to our shadow rapporteur for their outstanding work. There were, however, two points – to single out just a couple of topics, for time reasons – that were particularly close to our hearts. First of all, we had the support for small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs) – which was a very important point for us – and ensuring that standardisation is not only the realm of large companies, but also respects the needs of SMEs. In cases like this, the risk is, of course, always very large that the large companies will go ahead and implement and the small companies will have to catch up, which can be a cost-intensive exercise. We have also managed to ensure that the support and the funding in this area have been safeguarded. The second area that was important to us was the removal of a section of the services that have recently been incorporated into this process, in particular, the removal of services of common economic interest and those of major importance to the professions. In this area, standardisation could be very dangerous, as these are fields that depend on creativity and the flexibility of service providers, and these must be safeguarded. We have reached a satisfactory compromise in this regard, and one in favour of which we, as a group, feel able to vote. As I said, though, there was a lot of work to do and I hope that things will be somewhat easier from here on in. Evelyne Gebhardt,  
rapporteur for the opinion of the Committee on the Internal Market and Consumer Protection.

 Mr President, we were very disappointed, Mr Barnier, to find that, in contrast to what was announced in the work programme for 2011, there was no legislative proposal, but merely a recommendation to the Member States. Therefore, I very much welcome the fact that today, you are showing your determination to submit a legislative proposal by the autumn at the latest, I hope, because we all know that calls to the Commission simply do not achieve anything. A total of 30 million citizens are waiting to have access to a basic account, so that they can perform the fundamental tasks that are part of life in today’s society. These 30 million citizens are seasonal workers, people on low incomes, the homeless and students, and all of them have a right to a bank account. We need to make sure that they get one. The basic account must also be cost-effective. We must not allow these people to be excluded again because of the cost, because they have no address or for some of the other reasons that are often given. We must ensure that they have a right to a bank account, because we cannot accept a situation in our society where there are first and second class citizens. For this reason, I very much hope that you will be able to persuade the College of Commissioners very quickly. We will help you, Mr Barnier, to make sure that the Member States ultimately also agree, because these really are fundamental rights. Evelyne Gebhardt  (S&amp;D
). 
 – (DE) 
Mr President, Commissioner, Mr Creutzmann, I believe that we are facing a very important issue here, and one that must be solved, regulated. I therefore very much welcomed it when the Commission brought forward this legislative proposal. This is about the safety of our citizens. We have obtained a great deal of information about how problematic counterfeit products are for people’s health and well-being, but also for pricing, and how important it is for businesses to be able to sell products that they have actually produced, in which connection it goes without saying that intellectual property rights must be properly protected. There are, however, a few issues that are still subject to fierce debate within Parliament. One such issue seems to have been resolved to some extent, and in that regard I would like to offer my sincere thanks to Ms Hedh, who produced great work in connection with generic medicines. The transiting issue is an absolutely essential issue in this context. We cannot accept the introduction of obstacles here that actually have nothing to do with the protection of intellectual property but relate to entirely different issues. We need to very carefully weigh up what we do in this area. Otherwise, Ms Hedh provided a very clear picture of what problems result in this context. The second point, which we believe to be very important – and, in this regard, I was very pleased by what you had to say earlier in respect of patent infringements, Mr Šemeta – is that the rule of law must be safeguarded in all cases. For that reason, if two of the amendments tabled by our group are not adopted, we as a group will not ultimately be able to vote in favour of the Creutzmann report, as we want there to be legal certainty here, but also that the rule of law and the rights of citizens in this connection should be safeguarded. It is therefore not all the same to us how the final vote goes. Our final vote tomorrow is therefore actually still in the balance. Evelyne Gebhardt,  
on behalf of the S&amp;D Group.

 Mr President, Commissioner, on the 20th anniversary of the internal market, the issue of the internal market really deserves the attention we are giving it today. It is one of our great achievements that we can move freely in the European Union, that we can sell our goods throughout Europe, that we have a high degree of product safety, and that we can bring citizens together here in this House, and it is a delight that we are working on it. It is therefore important, Mr Barnier, that you continue on the path you have embarked upon so as to ensure, together with us, that the positive aspects of the internal market are brought closer to citizens and that they recognise what they have gained from the European internal market. That is something that is missing, that citizens do not recognise, because we talk too much about problems and not enough about the achievements of the European Union. It is therefore also important that we concentrate more on what we have enshrined in Article 3 of the Treaty of Lisbon, which is that we want to have and also need a social market economy – and I place particular emphasis on the word ‘social’ – so that workers and consumers recognise themselves in Europe. I would also like to praise what Louis Grech highlighted in his report by adopting an holistic approach, which we need so that we can really see the internal market as a global concept and not as disconnected small actions that run alongside each other, and with which a philosophy of Europe is truly associated. It is really important to work on this together and we should continue to do so. The internal market is good, but there is one thing we should not forget: it must be structured for the benefit of citizens and not just for the benefit of enterprises and the financial world.

 Madam President, good levels of cooperation with the Member States of the European Economic Area (EEA) and the European Free Trade Association (EFTA) are very important to us. We enjoy a privileged relationship, which we wish to develop further in a highly positive way. However, this also means that both sides must adhere to existing agreements and, as the European Parliament and as Europeans, we must take care to ensure that no discrimination between the Member States of the European Union is allowed to creep in, whether in the interpretation of the wording of agreements, or in any other way. That is why I fail to understand the approach taken by the Swiss in applying the quota provisions that Switzerland is entitled to impose under the agreements. What we find unacceptable is that a distinction is made between Member States, in other words between the citizens of eight Member States of the European Union and the remaining States of the Union. This runs counter to the spirit of the European Union. We are all equal and must all be treated equally. That is why we cannot accept a distinction in this case. The provisions of Article 10 of the 1999 Agreement relate to employed and self-employed persons from the European Community. This is stated clearly in the agreements and we must insist that all citizens of the European Community are dealt with equally. This is the reason for our question to the European Commission regarding the status of discussions in this area with Switzerland. We would also ask you to clarify that we do not have first and second class citizens in the European Union and that the quota provision must apply to the European Community as a whole and that no distinction between citizens is permitted.

 Mr President, as there is a certain amount of confusion in my group with regard to what we are actually voting on here, I would like to point out that we are talking about a reference to the WARF judgment by the European Patent Office in which we want the whole of the technical theory behind the application to be taken into account. It is not about stem cells – they have absolutely nothing to do with this resolution. Evelyne Gebhardt,  
on behalf of the S&amp;D Group.

 Mr President, Mr De Gucht, this is an extremely important discussion. Of course, we are all in favour of inventions being patented and of protecting new products in a way that genuinely benefits the people who have invented them. However, when it comes to breeding methods in biological fields, we need to consider very carefully what actually constitutes an invention and what is just a discovery or a development of a natural breeding method. That is one of the questions which arises in the context of patenting. There are some cases, including tomatoes and broccoli, where we have to ask ourselves in which direction the Convention on the Grant of European Patents is moving. Mr De Gucht, you have yourself just admitted that, as far as patentability and the implementation and interpretation of the law in this field are concerned, there are some grey areas. It is precisely these grey areas we are referring to when we say that we need to think about how we handle this issue. We must ensure that the wide range of different varieties and breeds that we have in the European Union and the varied breeding methods, all of which have their own value, are not destroyed by patent claims that are too far-reaching. We must also ensure that small and medium-sized businesses can continue to develop and exercise their breeders’ privilege and that this is not ruined by granting patents which will prevent this privilege from being applied and which will no longer allow these businesses to make free use of the natural material that is readily available. This is one of the points that concerns us and we are asking the Commission, Mr De Gucht, to focus its attention on this area and to evaluate to what extent the bans which we imposed in the directive on the legal protection of biotechnological inventions, and which involved heated debates at the time, are really being respected. The principle that what the European Patent Office has laid down, in other words, that not only the explicit wording of the claims but also the overall technical theory behind the application needs to be considered, must be applied and respected. Evelyne Gebhardt,

Mr President, Commissioner, consumers experience a great deal of uncertainty when they go into shops and see a locally produced product. No one knows what that actually means. Does it actually come from somewhere local or is the yoghurt that is claimed to be local perhaps produced using milk that had first been transported a thousand kilometres? Is that what we as consumers want? It is time that we clarified what is actually meant by the term ‘locally produced’. Many citizens would like to know that. This is not because they want to pursue food nationalism, but because they take protection of the climate and the environment seriously, and they say: these natural products that I am buying today do not need to come from a long distance away when they can also be produced locally, and I would prefer that. These things are important. We want clarity so that responsible citizens can also take responsible decisions. After all, what does it mean to be able to take responsible decisions? It means receiving the information that you need to formulate the decision accordingly. These are things that we need to clarify. The Commission has, in fact, started to consider this matter. I would be very grateful, Commissioner, if you could tell us by when we can expect action to be taken by the Commission. When will we potentially also have legislative proposals on the table with which we will be able to provide citizens with an answer to these pressing questions? It is not a question of preventing products from coming from other countries. I always look forward to the delicious products from Spain that I can buy in Germany, because they cannot be produced in Germany. However, there are also products that are produced locally. It is important for us to ensure that citizens know where a product comes from, what the quality of the product is, and that there is not always a riddle associated with it in terms of how the information should be interpreted, what the quality label that they see means, and whether it actually has any value or any real meaning. This is the legal certainty that we want for our citizens. Evelyne Gebhardt  (S&amp;D

 Mr President, Commissioner Barnier, as rapporteur for the Services Directive, I did ensure, at that time, that services of common economic interest and services of general interest were excluded from the scope of that directive. At the same time I said that it is absolutely necessary for these services to be regulated at European level in order to protect them. Since then, we have seen the advent of the Treaty of Lisbon and its supplementary Protocol No 26, which gives the Commission a duty. Commission President Barroso promised us that he would act in this regard and we await real and substantial action from the Commission in this area. My question for you, Commissioner, is: when can we expect a legislative text from you? This is something that is needed, in my opinion. It is needed not because we want to regulate these services, but because we want to ensure that these services continue to remain in the hands of the competent people and bodies in the Member States, and with the highest possible level of quality. Evelyne Gebhardt  (S&amp;D
). 
 – (DE)
 Mr President, with respect, Commissioner, I do not see this the same way as you. What you have just presented is a breakdown of the legislation, and not the implementation of what is stipulated under Protocol No 26 of the Treaty of Lisbon, which quite clearly sets out that we need a legislative framework within which the protection of these services of general economic interest is to be regulated. That is something quite different to what you just presented to us I would like to know when you actually intend to implement the Treaty on European Union. Evelyne Gebhardt,  
rapporteur for the opinion of the Committee on the Internal Market and Consumer Protection
. – (DE) 
Madam President, the Committee on the Internal Market and Consumer Protection has also deliberated in detail on the Single Euro Payments Area, or SEPA, because this issue is very much concerned with consumer protection. I can state that I am very happy with the compromise reached, because it also incorporates some of the topics adopted by us in committee. It is a very good thing that we can say to consumers that we are thinking of them, too, in the area of the financial markets, because they do not always get that impression. Borders for payment transactions are borders in Europe. It is time that these were removed, so that they no longer stand in the way of European mobility. I very much welcome the fact that it has been established that, in future, all enterprises and consumers will be able to make euro payment transactions in other European countries from a single account at any bank. This is very important, particularly for small and medium-sized enterprises. Not just for enterprises, though, but also for consumers who are mobile, who go on holiday and who want to make credit transfers. It is also very good that we have ensured that there is a single migration date for credit transfers and direct debits. It would not have been good for consumers to have two different dates, as that would have resulted in greater confusion. Clarity and legal certainty – that is what we need, and that is what we have achieved here. My third and last point concerns the information given to citizens. That is also extremely important. A great many of them are afraid of this new SEPA number, of the new IBAN code, because it seems too long to them. If we tell them quite clearly how it is composed, however, then they will not find it so difficult and complicated at all. In other words, it is very important that we have an information campaign so that people know what this is all about. Evelyne Gebhardt,  
on behalf of the S&amp;D Group.

 Mr President, Commissioner, the forum in Kraków really was a great success. This needs to be repeated, because good initiatives really ought to be continued. In this connection, I would like once again to thank Mr Grech, who as we know had the original idea that we should present the 20 most important concerns of citizens at such a forum. That was the key element of what we did, namely to place the concerns of citizens at the forefront so that they can see that the single market is not something abstract, but something that will actually provide them with added value. It concerned such diverse issues as the recognition of professional qualifications, the opportunity for young people to open a bank account in another Member State – which is sometimes very difficult – legal certainty in connection with online shopping, the Posting of Workers Directive, which urgently needs to be updated and amended, the strengthening of small and medium-sized enterprises and so on. Many subjects were discussed and the relevant problems highlighted. Commissioner, in future we need to put greater emphasis on the solutions on offer. In this regard, we await everything that you as the Commission have promised for next year, and Parliament and my group, the Group of the Progressive Alliance of Socialists and Democrats in the European Parliament, will monitor what you present to us with a very critical, but positive eye. Evelyne Gebhardt  (S&amp;D
). 
 – (DE) 
Madam President, the streamlining of the law in this area of mutual recognition of professional qualifications is extremely important. After all, we want policies that are in the best interests of our citizens. We all want our citizens to be able to move about freely and pursue their careers throughout the European Union. There are still far too many problems and obstacles raised by the Member States, as well as difficulties posed by European law, and it is important that we should tackle this issue. I am grateful to Mr Barnier, however, because he has stated that the answer does not necessarily lie in the deregulation of regulated professions. Those who favour such a move still have not indicated which professions they would like to see deregulated. I would like to know: are they talking about doctors, engineers or architects? I am not sure. What I am sure about is that regulation is extremely important and necessary. With regard to the professional card: this is something that would allow our citizens genuine freedom of movement, which is why we should not spend too much time on analysis, but instead should respond to the need expressed by those affected. Engineers and doctors were the first to say that they needed something like this to be able to move more freely around Europe, which is, after all, a political union. It is for this reason that we must say yes to this, and do so as quickly as possible. Evelyne Gebhardt  (S&amp;D

 Madam President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, public procurement is an extremely important task that we have for the future. I very much welcome the fact that the European Commission intends not only to improve legal certainty, but also to put right some aspects that have gone wrong. I would also like to thank the rapporteur, Ms Rühle, for having included a couple of points that are extremely important to those of us who are members of the Group of the Progressive Alliance of Socialists and Democrats in the European Parliament. Firstly, there is the issue that we must ensure that the rights of workers are safeguarded and that social criteria enjoy a prominent place. That is very important to us, because global sustainability includes ensuring that we do not generate poverty tomorrow but that instead, when awarding contracts, we also ensure that reasonable prices are paid, enabling us to protect the lives of workers. Another important point for us was, and remains, the fact that subcontractors are treated in exactly the same way as contractors – so that when contracts are awarded to contractors, the criteria cannot then be set aside because their subcontractors do not have to adhere to them. This is not a pipe dream, but rather it is a point that is very important to us: ensuring that legal certainty is brought about in this respect, so that we can genuinely make sure that public procurement remains transparent and comprehensible to the public, and so as to ensure fair competition between enterprises – particularly where small and medium-sized enterprises are concerned. Far from being inappropriate criteria, therefore, these are criteria that are extremely important. Evelyne Gebhardt  (S&amp;D
).

 Madam President, Mr Oettinger, the Commission shares the European Parliament’s concerns. This is very nice, but we have been waiting for years for the Commission to take action and to make some genuine progress in this area. We have Mr Busuttil’s report in front of us. In the last parliamentary term, the Committee on the Internal Market and Consumer Protection repeatedly highlighted the fact that we finally need to do something to help people. The problem is that people are still waiting for this help to arrive. Many of the small voluntary organisations that are affected do not have the financial means or the chutzpah to defend themselves. Only last week I received another letter asking: ‘How can I defend myself? I do not have the money for a lawyer, so I cannot take legal proceedings’. I believe that we must finally give the citizens of Europe an effective means of ridding themselves of this problem. Evelyne Gebhardt,  
on behalf of the S&amp;D Group.

 Mr President, I very much hope that it will be possible to rescue the 200 people who are in distress, because this is a very important matter. Thank you for informing us about this. Mr Barnier, Mrs Győri, ladies and gentlemen, Article 3 of the Treaty of Lisbon, which enshrines the social market economy, represents a new approach and a new political task for the future. Of course, we now have to complete this task and we have been waiting to do so for the last two years. I am pleased that the European Commission has made the first move in this direction. I am also very pleased that we in the Group of the Progressive Alliance of Socialists and Democrats in the European Parliament have succeeded, after a hard struggle, in ensuring that the social clause is included in the European Parliament’s position when we vote on this issue today. This is a very important question, because it forms the basis for social cohesion and will enable us to ensure that the internal market is regarded by people in the European Union as a social component. This is essential if we want the citizens of Europe to regain their trust in the political system in the European Union. In particular, the Commission must finally acknowledge the decisive significance of social rights in the internal market and put the focus on the social impact of European legislation. This is why it is important for Parliament to remind the Commission once again about the social clause which is enshrined in the Treaty of Lisbon. I would like to thank Mr Barnier for assuring us that he will take this into consideration and will follow this route. He can be sure of the full support of the Group of the Progressive Alliance of Socialists and Democrats in the European Parliament. Mr Barnier, the social clause also means, of course, that the Posting of Workers Directive must be revised accordingly. It means that the right to work and to strike must be respected in the Member States, together with the issues which really concern people, and that these rights must be incorporated into the internal market policy of the European Union without any ifs and buts and without restrictions. That is what concerns us as Social Democrats. If the internal market is developed on this basis, we will give you our support and our policy will be moving in the right direction. Of course, other questions are also important in this context. The recognition of professional qualifications, the European qualifications passport and the full transferability of pensions within the European Union are all issues which interest the citizens of Europe and which will ensure that the internal market is a market for the people. This is exactly what we Social Democrats are always saying. The economy is there for the people and not vice versa. If we follow this path, then we will be on the right track. Evelyne Gebhardt  (S&amp;D
).

 Mr President, I support the proposal by the Group of the European People’s Party (Christian Democrats), as it makes perfect sense to discuss this. I would just ask – in agreement with the coordinator of the Committee on the Internal Market and Consumer Protection, Mr Schwab – that we do not vote on the resolution this week, but wait until May to do so, because we have not yet had time to discuss this among the groups. Thus, I would say ‘yes’ to the inclusion of this item on the agenda, ‘yes’ to a resolution, but I would like the vote on the resolution to wait until May. Evelyne Gebhardt  (S&amp;D
). 
 – (DE)
 Mr President, I asked that the vote on the resolution on public procurement be postponed until May, which, of course, means that the deadline for the submission of resolutions and amendments would then also be postponed accordingly. You have not given us a chance to vote on that yet. Evelyne Gebhardt,  
on behalf of the S&amp;D Group.
 – (DE)
 Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, we did indeed experience some very tough negotiations, Mr Schwab, as opinions were very divided at the start of discussions. Likewise, it was not easy to decide on a reasonable course of action. However, these negotiations did succeed in achieving significant improvements, even after the vote at committee level, which finally made it possible for my group to vote in favour of this compromise package tomorrow. After all the discussions we have held, you will be aware of how much this means. We have indeed made a number of improvements. Accordingly, the fundamental principle followed in the directive is now, once again, minimum harmonisation – with the exception of the areas that are to be fully harmonised, which was an important concern for us. We excluded social services, healthcare services and games of chance from the scope of this directive because these are the areas that require special regulation. You cannot apply the same principles to them as to commercial services, commodities or retailing and so this was an important consideration. We have significantly strengthened the obligations to provide information to our citizens, the consumers. For this reason I would like to make it clear to the President-in-Office of the Council that the idea of dropping Chapter 2, in other words removing exactly the areas where this obligation to provide information is to apply, is something that the Group of the Progressive Alliance of Socialists and Democrats in the European Parliament will not tolerate. We have included electronic products in the scope of the directive, something not envisaged in the Commission’s original proposal. However, distance selling via the Internet is one of the key areas that has been included. As we reached the home straight, we also succeeded in improving the provisions on door-to-door selling. These are positive improvements that have enabled us to lend our support. I cannot deny that a few problems still exist, in particular the clauses relating to unfair contract terms in Chapter 5. We are very dissatisfied with these provisions and will either have to do some more work here or, if necessary, omit this section entirely. However, something that causes even more difficulty is the fact that financial services have been completely excluded from the obligations to provide information. I think we have a serious problem here. We will have to discuss this further, Commissioner, because financial services were included in your proposals and this should remain the case. To summarise: we will vote in favour of the compromise package and will also vote to refer the directive back to committee, but this does not mean that we agree to adopt the directive at first reading. Evelyne Gebhardt,  
rapporteur.

 Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, here in the European Parliament, we have been debating the Services Directive for a long time, and we have expressed many concerns in our debates about how it should be implemented and how we can ensure that service providers have free movement within the European Union. This was an important piece of policy. That is why we, as Parliament, decided that we not only wanted to make the legislation, but that we also wanted to monitor how the Services Directive is actually transposed in the Member States. It is in our interest that the directive be transposed properly, correctly and well. The European Commission also agreed to help us in this regard. I would therefore like to thank Commissioner Barnier, who has provided us with valuable information in this connection. We have particular concerns about four specific areas, namely, the evaluation procedure, the points of single contact, administrative cooperation and the scope of the directive. On the first point, I have the following to say. Mutual evaluation is one of the core items where we, as Parliament, and I, as the then rapporteur, said actually, we are opposed to this, as this means an awful lot of bureaucracy in the Member States. I am also hearing from the Member States today that there are indeed complaints about the bureaucracy. In that regard, however, I would quite simply like to make it very clear to the Member States once again that they were the ones that wanted this, not Parliament! They inserted it into the legislation and, as such, they should take the responsibility for it themselves even if, for example, local communities are beginning to discuss what Europe has done to them again. On the question of the second point – the points of single contact – I would say that this is the answer to what we have done in the political sense. We said quite clearly that the principle of the Services Directive is not the country of origin principle but the country of destination principle. That means that service providers must respect the law of the State in which they operate. That makes it all the more important that they obtain from the points of single contact not only the information about the laws that they have to respect, but also the necessary assistance to enable them to really apply that law properly and consistently in the Member States. I therefore find it very regrettable that, while these points of single contact have been set up in many Member States – although not all of them as yet – this has only been done in a very unsatisfactory way. In some cases, they are merely Internet portals. That does not satisfy us, the European Parliament – there needs to be much more behind these points of single contact. There need to be people behind them who can provide real assistance for the service providers in this area. One issue here is the language that is provided. It is not enough to offer the local language and perhaps English. In my view – and Parliament has spoken in similar terms – it is important for service providers that the language of the neighbouring county is also spoken. I say this with one eye on our Polish President – in the border area between Germany and Poland, German should be offered in Poland and Polish in Germany so that the information and assistance are actually really good, so that even the small businesses, which are not all competent in English, can really get involved in cross-border activities. Administrative cooperation is another important point and it is an area where we are heading in the right direction. In this regard, the Member States still have an awful lot more to do in the area of cooperation and of the education and training of officials, so that this system can be really well used. Finally, we come to the scope, in which connection I would like to make it quite clear, once again, that we excluded all services of common economic interest from the scope of Article 16. I expect the Member States to respect that. If they want to include these services in the scope of the Services Directive, that is their right, but in that case, they must not sweep it all up as part of the Services Directive; rather, it is their own political statement of intent and something that they should also assume responsibility for themselves. That is what I demand of the Member States in this context. Evelyne Gebhardt,  
rapporteur.
 – (DE)
 Mr President, this debate was very interesting and illuminating. There was one observation I have to make, though, and that was that there are still people who continue to have in their heads the old Bolkestein proposal, which actually provided for liberalisation and deregulation, despite the fact that that really is a thing of the past and that the Services Directive, as constituted at present, is about enabling people to use their qualifications to offer services across the European Union. That is what this Services Directive is about, and it is important to keep saying so. I would like to stress that once again and we have also made that change quite clear. In addition, I would also like to remind you all that we absolutely do have a social clause in the Services Directive. This is because we have included, in Article 1, a clause whereby the labour and social law of the Member States cannot be jeopardised by the application of the Services Directive. Thus, if something like that were to happen in a Member State – and I did say this at the beginning – that would be an incorrect implementation of the Services Directive. If you want to speak of the Rüffert case and others, that has no relevance to the Services Directive. Such cases relate to the Posting of Workers Directive and its implementation and to the public procurement directives. Please do not fall into the trap of comparing apples and oranges. While apples and oranges perhaps both produce a good fruit stew, that is completely the wrong approach to take in politics. We therefore really need to very closely monitor what happens. I repeat my call for us to ensure that the Services Directive is correctly transposed in the Member States and not used to take rights away or to deregulate – that is not the job of the Services Directive. Of course, it remains a quite clear demand for us that we in the European Union in any case need a legal framework to protect services of general economic interest. I am eager to see what the Commission will produce for us in this regard. Evelyne Gebhardt,  
on behalf of the S&amp;D Group.

 Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, I would like to express my very sincere thanks to the rapporteur, Mrs Stihler, who has done some very important work in this highly technical area. It is not only a technical report that we have before us; it is also a highly political report – a report in which high political standards also had to be respected. It was necessary to balance the various interests of industry, safety and the protection of workers, and, in the view of the European Parliament and the Group of the Progressive Alliance of Socialists and Democrats in the European Parliament, the rapporteur has succeeded admirably in doing this. It was essential to respect the interests of the industry and to see where their problems are in this area of construction products. It was also important to find a balance between the large and the small and medium-sized enterprises. Our view was that the Commission was right to suggest that small enterprises need fewer rules. However, that does not mean – and this is where the Commission’s proposal was improved upon – that a lower level of safety should be permitted. The level of the standards must also be genuinely high, something that we managed to achieve in this area. Of course, it is also important to place safety at the forefront. This is of particular importance for consumers because, where a construction product is manufactured and installed, it must be ensured that the user of the product is ultimately just as safe as those who worked with it beforehand. The third point that was particularly important to us, as Social Democrats, was improving worker protection and the fact that this has also been explicitly incorporated once again. Mrs Stihler also attached a great deal of importance to this in her remarks. After all, these construction products often involve work with hazardous substances and materials. It is extremely important to ensure that the highest possible level of protection is indeed achieved in this area. This level of protection will also need to be considered later – and that is something that we probably still need to work on, Mr Tajani – in connection with the disposal of these products once they are no longer needed. I would like to thank the rapporteur most sincerely once again for her truly splendid work. Evelyne Gebhardt,  
on behalf of the S&amp;D Group.

 Mr President, Commissioner, I would like to express my thanks to Mrs Weisgerber for the truly collegial collaboration that we enjoyed. I would like to say, on behalf of my group, that I am far from euphoric about the repeal of these eight directives. There are, in fact, a number of outdated measuring instruments for which the rules and regulations are being abolished, but we have noted in the debates that the devil is in the detail, as you yourself have said. It therefore was not always clear whether this route really was the right one to choose. My group will vote in favour of this compromise in light of the fact that we have obtained an assurance from the Commission that it will examine the idea of properly incorporating these measurement instruments into the European Measuring Instruments Directive (MID), which is, of course, being drawn up at the moment, where necessary. This commitment to investigate – this, too, I am assuming – will also be taken very seriously and given earnest consideration. We are voting for the compromise on this condition, well aware that there are still one or two issues that need to be investigated. As for the correlation tables, I would like to say, at this point, that we have now stated that we are ready to accept the mild wording that is currently to be found in this text but that this is one of the last documents in which we have accepted this, as, for us, this really is about European law, which is created once the Member States have given their consent, being truly and properly implemented. We can only check that, however, if we have the information, and we only get the information from these correlation tables. We will continue to work towards that, at all events. Evelyne Gebhardt,

 Mr President, year after year, we have this debate about the safety of toys. Year after year, we have to observe that there is still much that is in need of improvement. We are talking, here, amongst other things, about what are known as carcinogenic, mutagenic and reprotoxic substances (CMRs), substances that cause cancer and that may be very hazardous to the health and, in some cases, even the life of children. The new information does indeed show that we need to ensure that the limit values are adapted and we are calling on the Commission to finally do so. Commissioner, I really hope that this will actually happen. This is not the only problem, however. There is another problem in the shape of market supervision, and the Member States, too, have a responsibility here. They have a responsibility to ensure that only toys that truly satisfy the safety standards that we have adopted reach the market. That is not always the case, which is highly regrettable. We therefore need to ensure that these safety standards are improved. The third and final point that I wish to make relates to the marking of toys. Many people wrongly believe that the CE mark is an indicator of safety. It is not, however, as the Commission itself says. It is therefore time, Commissioner, that the Commission gave some thought to how we could issue a European safety mark that is truly reliable and that is monitored by third parties, independent authorities or bodies, so that a dangerous toy simply cannot make it onto the market or into the shops where it can threaten the health of our children. I believe that we have a major debt to discharge in this regard, and there is still much that we need to do, and urgently so. Evelyne Gebhardt  (S&amp;D

 Mr President, Mr Barroso, ladies and gentlemen, I believe that we have made major progress on behalf of the citizens of Europe with the Treaty of Lisbon, because we have included the social market economy among the principles of European policy. It is clear that we as Europeans and as parliamentarians expect the social market economy to be turned into a reality. Now we are looking at the internal market itself and the issues relating to the internal market as a whole and we can see that some of the things which should have been included have been omitted. It is not enough to carry out social impact assessments of European legislation. We need a social clause to be put into practice, so that the promises which were made that the citizens would really benefit from Europe are fulfilled and do not simply remain on paper. This is not just about the social clause, but also about important issues such as the services of general economic interest, which require special protection. It is very important to me that the European Commission finally addresses this question and looks more closely at issues concerning workers than was necessary, for example, in the context of the Posting of Workers Directive, where we are still waiting to find out what will happen next. Finally, and now I am slowly starting to get really annoyed, we have been calling on the European Commission for a long time to introduce a system for class actions at a European level. The Commission has already carried out six or seven different studies. What do we find now in this work programme? Another study has been commissioned. We cannot go on like this. We want the Commission to finally come up with some proposals and decisions in this area. Evelyne Gebhardt,  
on behalf of the S&amp;D Group.

Madam President, thank you Commissioner Barnier for the work you have done. It was no easy task that you had and you have included something of what Professor Monti set out in his report and what Mr Grech drew up for the European Parliament. We can also see something of that in there, as well as the attempt to take the holistic approach, which has not succeeded in quite the way we imagined it would, but is nevertheless on the right track. It is also very important that you make it absolutely clear that you are attempting to make the social rights of citizens, which should, of course, be at the heart of the European Union’s legislation, a reality. However, on behalf of my group, I have to say that we feel some things in this text are too vague, too simple or too insignificant, or are missing altogether, because one of the crucial demands that we had, and which you also agreed to, was for a social clause to be included in all important areas of European policy. We cannot find this social clause. A commitment to carrying out social impact assessments could satisfy us. However, a social clause is significantly more than what we find here in this text. We will endeavour to help you so that we make progress in the right direction, because this is very important to us. There is another point that I find quite problematic and that was also very important to our group. We are calling for collective redress. We want collective redress for citizens so that they are also genuinely able to assert their consumer protection rights. On behalf of the European Commission, you announced that more studies are to be carried out. Studies have been carried out in this area for three years. I think it is time for us to get on with it and for us to actually receive a legislative proposal from you, not merely another proposal for a study to be carried out, so that we can see how we can move forward from here. As you see, there are some things that we are satisfied with, but other things that we are not so happy about and we will work hard with you, the Council and our fellow Members from the other groups to ensure that we ultimately have a genuinely good text.

 The fight against terrorism requires international cooperation governed by agreements. However, these must not erode the fundamental rights of citizens laid down in the European Charter of Fundamental Rights. In modern times in particular, these rights also include the protection of data, which is not adequately guaranteed by the SWIFT agreement negotiated with the United States. Combating terrorism must not become an excuse for inadequate data protection. Other serious shortcomings in this agreement include, for example, the inspection of bank data without judicial approval, the long retention period for data, something that is impermissible under German constitutional law, as well as an inadequate opportunity for people to defend themselves in court against the unfair use of data. These are serious infringements of fundamental rights. However, the European Union is not permitted to unduly curtail existing fundamental rights. I therefore still reject this SWIFT agreement.

Mr President, Mr Grech, I would like to congratulate you on the truly excellent report which you have tabled before us here and which provides us with a basis from which to move forward. Thank you also for using a phrase which I myself use all the time, namely that the economy is there for the people and not the other way around. That is precisely what the policy of the European Union should be based on. In your report, you also quite rightly point out that an adequate assessment of the social, consumer-related, environmental and economic impacts of the internal market, and the decisions we make in the internal market, are of particular importance. That is precisely what has been missing so far or what has not been made sufficiently visible to our citizens. It is a very important approach to point out the actual humanist and holistic elements of our policy, even when it comes to the internal market. In your report, you also state one thing which is particularly important for us Social Democrats, and that is that social policy should be considered as a core of internal market policy and that protecting services of a general economic interest is of particular importance. In addition, you call for the development of a strategy for improved communication of the social advantages of the internal market. If we consider just these few points, we realise that we could achieve a great deal if only the European Commission gave us its backing. I also very much hope that the Commission will genuinely take the opportunity presented by the Grech report to put the progress of EU citizens centre stage. I make that plea very strongly and, as we know, Mr Barnier has already agreed to do so. If we approach the internal market from that angle, the policy of the European Union will meet with greater acceptance and we will be able to look towards a better future. Evelyne Gebhardt,

 Madam President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, as I follow this debate, I note that there is actually a great deal of uncertainty in relation to how the law is to be applied in these areas. Mr Andor, you just said that there is no European regulation laying down EUR 33 000 as a fixed limit. Dutch legislators, however, have laid down this limit of their own free will, probably because they were afraid that otherwise, the Commission would, at some point, require clear criteria to be put in place. This uncertainty leads to a great many difficulties in the Member States in relation to taking decisions themselves, specifically in terms of shaping those decisions so that they truly match up to what we need for these people and, in particular, for social housing, as these are people who do not have enough money to be able to move about freely. It is therefore very important for us to create a legal framework and legal certainty that also properly clarifies what is possible. Services of general economic interest, of course, really do need to be protected. They are provided at the local level in the Member States and they are universal and we need to ensure that they really are offered to everyone. We therefore have to consider – and I know this is being considered in the Committee on Employment and Social Affairs – demanding from the Commission a legal framework to protect services of general economic interest, especially in the social field, and I think that such a framework, were it to be provided, would be a good thing. Evelyne Gebhardt  (S&amp;D

 Mr President, Commissioner, Mr Manders, thank you very much for the good work that you have put into this regulation. I would also like to give particular thanks to my shadow rapporteur, since although this is indeed a technical report – as has been mentioned a number of times – it has many wide-ranging consequences for our citizens. After all, what we are concerned with here is allowing novel fibres to be placed on the market in the European Union. That is something we want to make possible. The European Commission is right in that. Not just anyhow, however; the fibres must be tested if citizens are genuinely to enjoy the consumer protection that we are always talking about. It is important, for example, to test whether the fibres are allergenic. They must also be clearly labelled, so that our citizens – who are always being described as responsible citizens – can also act accordingly. In this context, I must contradict the Members who have said that we should leave out country-of-origin marking. It is very important and absolutely right. Many citizens want to know where the fibres and textiles come from. What is their background? Their background includes the way in which they were manufactured. It is deplorable, but in many states, child labour or even slave labour are still used. There are citizens who want to know this information so that they can make a responsible choice when buying products. It may not be the job of this regulation, but it is the job of us Members to remind the Council of this and exert pressure to ensure that the text on origin marking that has been on the table since 2005 is at last put to good use. It is an opportunity to turn up this pressure and we should really seize it to achieve a good regulation about which our citizens say: yes, we can certainly live with that – that is the sort of thing we expect of our representatives in Parliament.

 Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, my group would actually have liked to support Mrs Rühle’s report, because it contains a great many very positive elements. Unfortunately, there are three points that we consider lacking or that we are unable to accept as they stand in the report. Firstly, Mrs Rühle was unable to accept that we genuinely have need of a legal framework for services in the general economic interest, and secondly, she also failed to state clearly that it is a matter of greater legal certainty in the area of social services in particular. This is a shortcoming of the report that we naturally find very regrettable. One point that we are absolutely unable to accept is the rejection of service concessions. We cannot simply say that it is something we do not want. The Court of Justice has already ruled on all this. It is highly unpolitical. It is very important that we say quite clearly what we want if we know that the European Commission is preparing a legal text. It is important that we call upon the European Commission actually to go along with the very positive position taken by the Court of Justice on this matter, thereby also ensuring legal certainty. That is our demand and consequently, we have submitted an alternative resolution. We ask our fellow Members to support this alternative resolution. Evelyne Gebhardt,

 Mr President, Commissioner Barnier, Commissioner Dalli, ladies and gentlemen, today we are talking about the internal market, consumer protection and the mobility of people within the European Union. These are the key issues when we are discussing these three instruments and they are what I want to address in particular. Bringing these three topics together provides a very great advantage for us today, because the economy and the rights of consumers and workers are not intrinsically opposed to one another; they need to be brought together. This is something that we need to make progress on for the future. That is why it is good that we are having this joint debate today. In order to make this a reality, we need, above all, to bring three political principles to the fore. Firstly – and Commissioner Barnier put this very well earlier – protectionism, which is still very much in evidence in the national governments of the Member States, needs to be overcome. That is something we need to do in any case and it is on the agenda. The second political principle is that we must guarantee a high level of protection of the rights of both consumers and workers. In other words, the internal market does not mean the abolition of rights and it does not mean deregulation. It means ensuring that we preserve our very high level of common rights in these areas. For this reason, there is one paragraph in Mrs von Thun Und Hohenstein’s report that we do not agree with. This concerns the so-called Internal Market Scoreboard or internal market test. This is the wrong approach. It gives the impression that the only important thing is how the market is functioning. That is not the case. We need to ask what impact the European Union legislation will have on the rights of workers and on the rights of consumers. We therefore reject this concept, because it is the wrong one. Thirdly, we need good enforcement of these rights at European level. For this, we need a system of collective redress so that consumers do not stand alone in this internal market, but are also able to really assert their rights. Evelyne Gebhardt,  
on behalf of the S&amp;D Group.

 Mr President, Commissioner, thank you very much for the information you have given us but, to be honest, I am not entirely satisfied. The previous Commission set itself the quite clear objective of liberalising the gambling market. The European Parliament has made it clear, time and again, that this cannot be the right approach, because it was the European Parliament, rather than Member States, that, for example, removed gambling from the scope of the Services Directive. We took the view that it is not just any other service, that we must ensure that we introduce safeguards which will protect our citizens from organised crime and that we require clear rules to that end. Nonetheless, the European Commission continues to bring Member States before the European Court of Justice, and it is time that the Commission ceased this practice as it keeps losing cases at the Court. You simply have to face this fact. I would, therefore, welcome it, Mr Barnier, if you put what you have just said, that is, that a different approach is needed in this area, into practice because we cannot proceed with things remaining as they are now. In response to your point, Mr Harbour, I would argue that the rulings of the European Court of Justice have been very consistent and not at all contradictory. In its judgments, the Court has stated, time and again, that Member States have the right to introduce clear rules, so that we can truly verify whether or not citizens are protected against crime, and that Member States are not under any obligation to open this market up. Nor are they under any obligation to allow market operators from other Member States to operate on their territory, as long as they make sure that their controls are strong and effective. That is what we want to see from the European Commission, that it has finally grasped this and acted accordingly. However, this also means that we have to pay particular attention to online gambling, because the Internet does not recognise any barriers or borders and, of course, because our citizens have access to gambling sites. We need to think about how we can shape controls and rules in this area, so that our citizens are protected. Evelyne Gebhardt  (S&amp;D

 Mr President, Mr Barroso, we were very happy to have got the Treaty of Lisbon in place on 1 December and, along with that, a stronger social policy and a strengthening of the position of consumers in the area of internal policy within the European Union. However, we now find that you – contrary to what is contained in the Treaty of Lisbon, namely a horizontal commitment to protect consumers – have done exactly the opposite with the division of the portfolios in your European Commission, because now there is not just one commissioner responsible for consumer protection, but several. I would like to ask you how you actually intend to handle this. How do you intend to establish coherence in this policy area, an area that is extremely important to consumers, to European citizens? The responsibilities have been divided up. Which commissioner will provide this coherence? Please do not tell us that it is the College that will decide. We need clear areas of responsibility. Please do not say to us, either, that ultimately you will decide in the event of a dispute between the different commissioners. You are not almighty and you belong to a College. I have serious difficulties with this, Mr Barroso. You need to explain to me how you can truly get to grips with this fragmentation of policy in the area of consumer protection, but also in other areas like foreign policy, so that we have a policy that, after five years, will allow us to say ‘yes, it was worth having a Commission like this’. I do not yet know how I will vote later. That will depend very much on your answers to our questions. Evelyne Gebhardt,

 Mr President, I would first like to say that it is totally outrageous that there are no members of the Commission here, because this is a question directed at the European Commission. This shows contempt for Parliament. It is simply outrageous and we find it totally unacceptable. (Heckling)
 Yes? Yes, he did not get up. Well, I am sorry. I cannot accept that. Moving on to the matter in hand, ladies and gentlemen, this is all about the citizenship of the Union, about the people who have the right to move freely throughout the European Union and to practise their professions where they live and where they choose to work. We have put this legislation in place so that this will become easier and so that the process of recognising professional qualifications can genuinely be brought up to date. I find it simply appalling that the Member States in many cases have not taken the necessary steps to implement this legislation and to ensure that citizens really have this freedom of movement. There is still a great deal to be done by the European Commission in this respect. I would like to draw attention to one point which is very important to me and which we have repeatedly brought up in Parliament. We must ensure that the European professional card, which we have proposed, is introduced. This will put into citizens’ hands something that will allow them to move throughout Europe. There are organisations which are attempting to do this. However, I feel it is important to ask the European Commission whether this is an area in which it could become involved in order to speed this process up. Evelyne Gebhardt,  
on behalf of the S&amp;D Group.

 Mr President, I am grateful that we are able to debate this topic today, as it is such an important one. I would like to make one thing absolutely clear: as Parliament, we have not merely played a part, but we have ensured that, in this Services Directive, a very positive, constructive compromise was found. This compromise is based, in particular, on guaranteeing labour and social rights and on the particular regard for and removal of the services of general economic interest. That was the reason why a Services Directive was possible in the first place. However, there are a few things than I am not sure about in this regard, and the questions that we raised have not been answered. It would, for example, be very disappointing if what I have heard from various sources turned out to be true, namely, that some Member States are using the transposition of the Services Directive to destroy the balance that we, as legislators, have found by not fully respecting the rights of workers as we envisaged in the Services Directive. This relates not only to the working conditions, which are being called into question, but in many Member States, the definitions are also being re-written or made more restrictive. There are also Member States which, with feeble justifications, are not removing the social services from amongst the services to which this transposition relates. In this respect, the European Commission’s Handbook was not very helpful, because the guidelines that it gave were partly wrong and it provided an interpretation that was, in our opinion, incorrect. The examples that I have given show how important it is for us also to create a legal framework for services of general economic interest, so that social rights, such as labour rights, can also be fully and completely respected once again. Anything else would not be sufficient. I would also like to ask the Member States to what extent they have involved the stakeholders and, in particular, the trade unions and the social services, in the transposition. This is a question that we raised, but to which I have not heard an answer, and I would very much like a good answer to this question. Evelyne Gebhardt (S&amp;D).

 Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, one thing needs to be stated very clearly: there is a unified system in China and we do not want to allow this system to break up. We respect the Chinese system. However, that does not mean ... (Interruption by Mr Posselt)
 We respect China’s unified system. However, that does not mean that the diversity of peoples in China must not also be respected. That is what we Social Democrats are calling for. We want citizens’ rights, human rights and people’s freedom to be respected in China. We want freedom of expression to be respected. We want journalists to be able to move around freely so that the situation as it really is can indeed be reported. That is what we want and there is one thing that we would say very clearly to our colleagues in China: what for us is a basic principle we would also expect to be a basic principle for you in China, namely that human rights are universal. What the politicians always say to us – let us first solve the social problems and then we can talk about human rights – is the wrong way to go about things. It must be the other way round. Human rights come first and then social rights, which are quite simply part and parcel of human rights and cannot be separated from them. I was therefore very disappointed by what you said, Mr Bildt. You seemed to be saying: let us work together on an economic level, that is our main concern and all of the other things are of no particular interest to us. That is not the approach that we need. We need to take the approach presented to us by the European Commission, namely to say that we first want a common basis for our work on which we can then build our cooperation, because we do want cooperation, that much is clear, but not on any basis, only on a correct basis that respects human dignity.

Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, the need for European solutions and European emergency plans is nowhere more obvious than in the case of European rivers, since they connect European countries. A bad example of this is the catastrophe two years ago when contaminated sludge from a Hungarian aluminium factory flowed into the Danube. It became obvious in that case how important cooperation is. Furthermore, seamless transport connections are especially important. As co-rapporteur of the report on the development of the trans-European transport network, I consider inland navigation as an important means of transport, because it is environmentally friendly and still has potential for growth. At the same time, we must also comply with emissions targets. We cannot expand at any cost. This means that we must place ecological considerations and environmental protection in the foreground and at the heart of this process.  We have heard today that one of the last free-flowing sections of the Danube between Straubing and Vilshofen is this kind of bad example. In my view, the environment must take precedence here. In the meantime, the CSU environment minister in the government of the state of Bavaria has recognised this. Now he has to convince his Bavarian Prime Minister and the Federal Transport Minister that any investment in further studies is unnecessary and that any investment – I refer here to the EUR 16.5 million which the Commission has also invested in this study – is, unfortunately, money spent in vain. It would be better spent – as Mr Theurer has mentioned – in the Danube Youth Foundation. This is the direction we need to take in future.

Mr President, Ms Lochbihler, thank you for your question. There is actually a certain contradiction in the Danube region strategy: on the one hand is the objective of environmental protection and on the other hand is the objective of supporting those who want to destroy the Danube. I will say quite clearly: it must not be a question of mobility at any price. The ships that travel on rivers must adapt to the rivers, not vice versa. If we give both these objectives equal importance, I can see how we can achieve both goals. Ecological considerations are at least as important as economic components. Ismail Ertug  (S&amp;D

Mr President, Mr President-in-Office of the Council, I would like to congratulate you on taking over the presidency and wish you every success in the job you have to do in these difficult times. You will need to be fully committed, Mr Christofias, when it comes to stimulating growth and creating jobs in the European Union. We are very interested in the specific solutions that you propose for combating youth unemployment You will have the support of Parliament if you take on this problem. The negotiations on the multiannual financial framework naturally have a high priority. You have rightly recognised, and I congratulate you on this, that the financing of the Trans-European Networks will bring significant added value to Europe. I would like to call on you to make a strong commitment to push through in the Council the approach to financing called for by the Commission. Your country will benefit from this, Mr Christofias. For example, the port of Limassol is part of the core transport network, as is Larnaka airport and the road project linking Limassol and Nicosia, which could receive European funding. When we talk about Cyprus, we are, of course, also referring to an unresolved problem which has already been mentioned several times today. Mr Christofias, what sort of scenario should the European Union expect if there is no solution for Cyprus, which after 38 years of unsuccessful negotiations seems more likely than ever?

 Mr President, rapporteur, ladies and gentlemen, I think it is clear that the European Union’s aim is to ensure a better common railways policy. This legislation helps bring that about. In this respect, it will help, for instance, by opening up basic services for the market, which is a beneficial thing to do. I would also like to offer the rapporteur specific thanks for also having stuck to the multiannual financial plans between infrastructure operators and the Member States, as doing so facilitates long-term planning in respect of funding, which provides a certain degree of planning certainty and, above all, it will have a positive impact on the development of the European railway market. We have heard a number of times today already that the most important element in this legislation will be organising the national regulatory bodies as they actually should be organised, which is to say, with more powers and such that they are not as weak as they are in many Member States of the Union. The situation today is that we have regulatory authorities that are unable to make it possible for other competitors to enter the market, and this means that market access is made more difficult. Under this legislation, such unfair practice will, first of all, be monitored and then it will also be eliminated and made possible for punishment to be imposed. My final point concerns what I would definitely consider a step in the right direction, by which, of course, I mean transparency in the financial flows. In this respect, it needs to be very clearly emphasised that this obviously must not pave the way for the pre-emption of the separation of networks and operators, as that would be too serious an intrusion into national subsidiarity rights. We should therefore leave it at that. I would like to offer my sincere thanks to the rapporteur once again, and especially also to the shadow rapporteurs, for the fact that we have produced such sound legislation. Ismail Ertug  (S&amp;D
). 
 – (DE)
 Mr President, first of all, let me add my voice to those thanking the rapporteur for her outstanding work, as well as the shadow rapporteurs, of course. This was a tough job, we are well aware of that. It has always been Parliament’s aim to ensure increased road safety. With various laws, this venerable House has helped to also bring that about. I would remind everyone at this juncture, just by way of example, about the issues of overtiredness behind the wheel and the fight against the exploitation of workers. Irrespective of this, it is, of course, important to constantly adapt to technical changes, technical developments. On that basis, we must continue to prevent manipulation of the devices in future, too, clearly while adhering to strict data protection provisions. Another point that is very important to me and which is achieved by means of this document is the harmonisation of the specific measures for the training of control officers and, very interestingly and importantly, the approximation of penalties. When it comes to the derogation, I would insist that this 150 kilometre stipulation for handicraft businesses be maintained, as this is important for the business of these companies.

The Tymoshenko case and political developments in Ukraine in general indicate that democracy and the rule of law still remain values that cannot be taken for granted in today’s Europe and for which we must actively campaign. The thirst for reform seemed enormous in Ukraine in the period following the Orange Revolution and the country quickly became a perfect example of the success of European neighbourhood policy. In this context I find it extremely regrettable that political life in Ukraine is once again characterised by political trials, political meddling in the administration of justice and state interference. The response of the European Commission and a number of Member States to the latest events is decisive but by no means excessive. The absence of the most senior Members of the Commission from the European Championship in Ukraine sets down a clear marker, but should not divert attention from the problems in the country and the possible solutions. For this reason I welcome your intention, Mr Füle, to continue with the association process with Ukraine if there are positive developments and, above all, if free and fair elections are held this autumn. In order to be able to provide positive support for developments in Ukraine in future, European neighbourhood policy must also incorporate the wishes and expectations of the people of Ukraine. Before we intensify our partnership, however, Yulia Tymoshenko must be given fair treatment. Naturally this must take her health into consideration and must be free from all state interference.

 The resolution before us sends out a clear signal and supports the conviction that the social democrats have had for a long time that the crisis can only be overcome if the financial sector is put in its place. To avoid the excesses of the banks in 2008 from being repeated in the future, we need to rigorously pursue two goals. Firstly, ladies and gentlemen, it must not be possible for banks to operate in such a short-sighted and reckless manner in the future. Secondly, we must invest more in the real economy in order to stem the power of the financial sector in today’s economy. Both of these things can be achieved by the planned tax. Even the extremely low tax rates of 0.01% and 0.1% would provide the Member States with additional resources of up to EUR 100 billion. That EUR 100 billion could relieve the burden on severely stretched budgets and be used to invest in lasting growth. I am confident that you will all use your votes to give this proposal the necessary emphasis, and I call on all the Member States not to block the Commission’s proposal in the Council. However, should such a common EU-wide solution fail due to a handful of naysayers, then the remaining Member States must set a good example by pushing ahead via the process of enhanced cooperation.

 Mr President, Mr Kallas, as competition increases in the years to come, we can expect the volume of traffic to increase even further. If we look at the figures again, it becomes clear that more than a quarter of our current CO2
 emissions are produced by transport. This means that we must reduce our CO2
 emissions and increase the efficiency of our transport systems. In my opinion, you have taken the right approach in your document. Your proposal for new guidelines is primarily about giving priority to environmentally friendly means of transport. However, now we come to the ‘but’, Mr Kallas. This makes it all the more incomprehensible to me that you have seriously considered permitting cross-border transport on Europe’s roads using so-called monster trucks or gigaliners. I would be grateful if you could explain to us why you are considering this, without waiting for the analyses on road safety and the environment, and how you plan to proceed in future. You know that this is a very sensitive subject and that we are opposed to these trucks. Ismail Ertug  (S&amp;D

 All of us have painful memories of the images of the burning Deepwater Horizon oil platform in the spring of 2010. Outdated technology and the conscious acceptance of safety risks led to the two-month long outflow of incredible quantities of crude oil. As we all know, the consequences for people and the environment were disastrous. The fact that there is a danger of the same thing happening at the 450 drilling rigs in the North Sea, for example, was demonstrated in August of this year by the oil leak in the Gannet Alpha pipelines off the Scottish coast. I therefore welcome the proposal put before us to extend the areas of competence of the European Maritime Safety Agency in this regard, so that in future, safety inspections can also be carried out on oil drilling rigs. EMSA has already proven its ability to act in connection with past tanker disasters. On the basis of this experience, I believe that the proposed extension of the areas of competence is preferable to the creation of a new agency. In addition, this kind of European solution to maritime safety problems is preferable to having national supervisory authorities. The faster lines of communication and the cross-border consequences of incidents such as oil disasters can only be tackled at European level. Finally, I would like to thank Mr Fleckenstein for his excellent work as rapporteur and I call on all my fellow Members to support this important dossier. Ismail Ertug  (S&amp;D

 Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, the White Paper on transport was proposed by the Commission in order to set European transport policy goals for the next 20 or 40 years. I know that 40 years is perhaps a very extensive period. However, we must nevertheless bear in mind that transport projects require lengthy planning phases. I therefore support the long-term approach taken by the Commission. Let us take a look at the ambitious goals of the Commission, which I support: increased safety through the use of intelligent transport technologies, improved traffic routing using multimodal solutions, the internalisation of external costs and, above all, transport must become even more environmentally friendly. There are some good approaches and, in this regard, I would refer to the legislative proposals for environmentally friendly urban transport up to 2015. While we are on the subject of environmental protection, I would once again like to point out that it is extremely important to reduce greenhouse gas emissions still further. As regards the development of inland waterways, I would also like to take this opportunity to mention once again the planned development of the Danube. In this regard, we must ensure that this does not ultimately damage the natural environment. I would like to quote Mr Cramer here, who quite rightly always says that ships must be adapted to the river and not the other way around. I am pleased to see that good amendments were tabled in this regard. I would like to thank the rapporteur once again for being so ready to compromise. Finally, I would like to mention one more thing: I would have liked us to have implemented the 300 km approach in connection with the shifting of goods transport from the roads onto the railways. However, I would essentially like to say thank you very much and I hope this will be successful. Ismail Ertug  (S&amp;D

Madam President, Mr Koumoutsakos, ladies and gentlemen, the report on the Commission’s proposal for a programme to support the further development of an integrated maritime policy is one way to achieve the objectives of the Treaty of Lisbon and to increase coherence between the various policy areas. It is a welcome development that solutions have been sought on a cross-departmental basis in maritime policy and that an attempt has also been made to create synergies. Maritime policy goes beyond marine transport and fishing. Industry, research and alternative power generation, as well as environmental protection, are areas that are inseparably associated with the classic aspects of maritime policy. For this reason, there is a need for improved coordination between policy areas and between Member States with access to the sea. The report has improved on the Commission’s proposal on several counts. In this context, I expressly welcome the fact that more attention has been paid to environmental protection, the protection of species and the sustainable use of maritime resources, an aspect which, I must say, could have been given even more prominence in the Commission’s proposal. Mr Koumoutsakos, I hope that you receive a broad negotiating mandate for your report and would also like to thank Mr Milana for his work and wish you all the best for the future.

 Madam President, Ms Serracchiani, ladies and gentlemen, this proposal takes us one step closer to a simpler, more effective joint rail policy. The significantly strengthened regulatory body and financial plans spanning several years will help make rail travel more competitive and reliable. I am also particularly pleased that the rapporteur has succeeded in including social aspects in the focus of the report. After all, an integrated rail market must offer employees the same high-standard working conditions throughout the European Union. In this context, it is correct that the right to strike should remain inviolable. Opinion has been divided for some time in relation to the separation of the rail network and the operating companies and I would like expressly to thank the rapporteur for her tenacity and willingness to negotiate, because this has helped us find a well-balanced compromise. We now await the legislative proposal from the European Commission. Finally, I would ask and encourage you all to give our rapporteur broad support with a mandate that will enable her to enter into discussions and negotiations with the Council. A solid path has been laid. With this in mind, I would like to thank the rapporteur and wish her well. Ismail Ertug  (S&amp;D

 The road safety measures called for in the report are practical and ambitious. That is the only way that we can reduce the number of accidents on Europe’s roads in future. With the call for a stringent alcohol ban for newly qualified drivers and professional drivers and the call for a ‘vision zero’, Parliament can send out a clear message that road safety has top political priority and road deaths are simply not morally acceptable. If the Commission and the Council get behind the measures that we have proposed, we can at last actually begin to work towards such ambitious objectives. Ismail Ertug  (S&amp;D

 Poland joined the EU seven years and two months ago and we are pleased to see it take over the Presidency of the Council of the European Union. Poland is putting its hand to the tiller at a time when Europe is facing great challenges in terms of its finances, energy policy and internal politics. We therefore doubly welcome the fact that Poland also intends pursuing ambitious goals in transport policy. We Social Democrats welcome the fact that you intend to promote the improvement of social conditions for workers in the transport sector. By taking up the expansion of the Trans-European Transport Networks, you are not only planning to keep in view economic and territorial cohesion, but also the social cohesion of the various regions of the EU. As an advocate of sustainable transport policy, I am particularly pleased that your priorities are in line with those of the White Paper on Transport and that you are anxious to work with Parliament to find a speedy solution for the new version of the first railway package.

 For me, one particularly important issue with regard to security scanners is that the machines which are available must meet the necessary technical requirements, so that they do not slow down the operational processes and, therefore, lead to undesirable results. The main problems in my view are a reduction in passenger comfort and the introduction of complex processes which ultimately do not bring any increase in security. Unfortunately, past experience indicates that difficulties of this kind may occur. It is important to make the deadline for introducing the new systems dependent on the technology being fully functioning rather than on a specified date. In addition, it must be possible to combine the new machines with systems for detecting liquids. I would also like to highlight the fact that issues of space and structural engineering need to be taken into consideration in the case of the control unit (in other words, the security scanner and the X-ray device). Major structural alterations will be needed at many airports to support the weight of the machine and to make the necessary space available. The throughput rate for passengers must be equivalent to the existing figures at the passenger checkpoints. Otherwise there will be significant operational and quality problems. It is essential that the airports are able to put realistic plans in place. We must not forget that the necessary facilities must be made available, including space for the machines, structural engineering work and training measures, and that comprehensive plans are needed which cover the time and funding needed for the alterations to the buildings.

− (DE) My aim is still to achieve a uniform ban on genetically modified organisms (GMOs) in all Member States. We cannot tell what impact GMOs will have on our health, because the technology is still too new. The fundamental problem is that it has spread so rapidly. Having once introduced the technology, it is now impossible to get rid of it. Therefore, I welcome the fact that we are adopting a report today which makes a ban on GMOs possible and which strengthens consumers’ rights. Once again we are reinforcing consumers’ rights more effectively than the Member States have done. The European Parliament was responsible for introducing the mandatory labelling of GMOs last year, not the Council of Ministers. This report makes it possible for Member States to impose a ban on GMOs, because of the fear of pesticide resistance, for example. The fact that the World Trade Organisation (WTO) does not feel that concerns about the health of the population are sufficient grounds for a ban causes me to have very serious doubts about the WTO.

Madam President, as you said, Mr Kallas, the gigaliners or monster trucks or whatever you want to call them are a controversial subject. You mentioned efficiency gains in terms of fuel consumption. I would like to know what exactly these efficiency gains are. I know that those in favour of these trucks say that you can make one truck out of two. This would ultimately result in warehousing as we know it today becoming less expensive and it would be cheaper to drive goods around on the streets than to store them in warehouses, with the result that making one truck out of two would actually have exactly the opposite effect. I would like to ask you to consider this, because it would mean that we would have more trucks on the roads than we did before. You have announced various studies on the subject of the monster trucks. What is happening with them? What results have you so far received? What are the next steps to be taken? I would be interested in knowing more, because Germany does not have a uniform approach to these trucks and most people are opposed to them. Ismail Ertug  (S&amp;D

Mr President, Commissioner, President-in-Office of the Council, ladies and gentlemen, over 31 000 people a year are still dying on European roads. That being so, I find it negligent, to say the least, that the Member States’ transport ministers have blocked such an important instrument in the Council for over two years. As representatives of the people, you should be keen, for the safety of your citizens, to ensure that drivers from non-Member States cannot disregard traffic rules with impunity. The fact that we shall be voting on this proposal tomorrow is due, above all, to our rapporteur’s persistence. Like her, I too am disappointed that the Council has changed the legal basis for this directive, thereby provoking an opt-out by three Member States. This will create a law for EU-wide prosecution of traffic offences that will not be applied throughout the EU and I consider this less than perfect, to put it mildly. This disappointment notwithstanding, it is another important step towards closer cooperation in the road traffic sector and I should like to ask you all to vote in favour of this compromise tomorrow. I should like to point out once again that the rapporteur campaigned extremely hard for a strong review clause and to thank her for that; I hope that, when the review comes around within the next five years, the transport ministers will be not only older, but also wiser.

 We in the Group of the Progressive Alliance of Socialists and Democrats in the European Parliament have worked hard to ensure that the new EU agricultural policy is oriented towards ecological standards. In our view, farmers must be rewarded for providing services to society. That is exactly what they do, and nothing could be rewarded less in the prices currently being achieved at market. Retaining the two-pillar model guarantees that farmers will continue to receive a fixed amount in the future that they can rely on. These payments are important for long-term planning. By linking the direct payment to an economic variable we can achieve the transition from a Europe of 15 Member States to a Europe of 27 without offending anyone too much. The report is a good compromise; it is a European compromise. The question now is what the Commission, and particularly President Barroso, will make of it. Cutting the funding for environmental protection in particular suggests narrow-mindedness, and I hope Commissioner Cioloş will be able to talk him out of it. Ismail Ertug,

 Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, following a negotiations marathon, Mr El Khadraoui and the representatives of the Council and the Commission managed to tie up an improved package of measures for road charging for heavy goods vehicles in Europe. I am very grateful to those involved and, in particular, to our rapporteur, for what they have achieved. Through the recognition of the principle of internalising external costs, the partial earmarking of funding for the transport infrastructure and the incentives provided for fleet renewal, we have succeeded in realising important objectives from the Transport White Paper. I also believe that we must not overlook the obligations for transparency, which ultimately must also apply to the Council. I find it highly regrettable that several Member States attempted, even after the conclusion of the trialogue negotiations, to throw a spanner in the works – they really did try – in connection with the correlation tables in order to block this directive. Nonetheless, I would like to conclude by calling on all my fellow Members to accept the compromise achieved and not to jeopardise the results of these long and laboured negotiations, as all that would achieve would be to help the wrong people. You have my thanks for backing this compromise. Ismail Ertug  (S&amp;D

 We are absorbing antibiotics in our food, which is resulting in increased resistance. This is one area of medical progress which is gradually being ruined and we have known about this for a long time. Mr De Castro referred to the measures that have already been taken. I support the proposals made in the resolution. There are two aspects of this which I would like to focus on. Regulations alone are not enough. In the dioxin scandal, we have seen how easily they can be undermined, if individual ‘black sheep’ behave in a very negligent way. Of course, we must have regulations and we need to introduce monitoring systems, but that is not the entire solution. In the medium and long term, the solution is to make the use of antibiotics largely superfluous. We can achieve this firstly by investing in research and networking expert knowledge, secondly, by passing this knowledge on to farmers and vets and thirdly, by providing information to consumers. We must make clever use of market forces, because it is consumers who decide in the long term how their food is produced. Ismail Ertug  (S&amp;D

 Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, the volcanic ash of last year showed us in an impressive way where our weaknesses lie. The question therefore arises as to how we should deal with such situations in the future. It is, of course, first and foremost a question of the safety of those people who board an aeroplane. Of course, we must also keep in mind how we intend to deal with the financial losses. My question to the Commission is therefore – Mr Hahn, perhaps you could also pass this on to Mr Kallas – what, in specific terms, are we planning? I would argue that it is particularly important for us to take over the coordination when it comes to test flights and limit values. That is very important in order for us to know which aeroplanes can take off and when. I have another comment, Commissioner: it is extremely important – and this has already been referred to many times – to establish the Single European Sky. What does the Commission intend to do in terms of exerting pressure on the Member States to actually fulfil their obligation in this regard? After all, they have put their signatures to it. Another important point, which has already been made several times today, is what happens now with regard to passengers’ rights in air transport. We have Regulation (EC) No 2061 from 2004. What does the Commission intend to do in this regard? We are aware of the problem of the financial losses suffered by the various airlines. I would also like to point out once again that we need alternatives to air transport, and by that I mean the rail system. I am also one of those who believe that we must link the large cities – Europe’s capital cities – together. In this case, too, the answer is that we need more involvement from Europe, not less. I would be pleased if the Commission would give its attention to these issues. Ismail Ertug  (S&amp;D

Madam President, Mr President-in-Office of the Council, Mr Füle, I would like to wish you every success with your work in future. It is hard to ignore the ambivalence of the Cyprus issue. We in the European Union must not dismiss apparently unpleasant issues or try to pretend that they do not exist. We have not kept our promise. That is a fact and we must resolve these double standards. We know that the Ankara Protocol must definitely be implemented with regard to the Cyprus question. However, it is also clear, as stated by the Council in 2004, that the isolation of Northern Cyprus must come to an end. I am pleased that Southern Cyprus is providing the north with the necessary support, but this was not the intention of the European Union. Its intention was that everyone, the entire EU, should bring an end to the isolation. In order to overcome the final obstacle in this area, we must take a step forwards and put a stop to this isolation. Ismail Ertug  (S&amp;D
).

 Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, Turkey is, of course, an emotional topic, that is quite clear. There is one thing that we should, of course, always take into account in this context, and this has been mentioned several times today, namely that, although the prohibition of the party is totally unacceptable, it was not pronounced by the government, but by the judicial system. We need to draw a distinction here in order to be fair and honest. However, that was not what I wanted to say. As Europeans, we must ask ourselves where we actually want to go. If, as a global player, we want to pass on not only economic – and as a Social Democrat I would like to emphasise this – but also political values, not only in Europe but also beyond European borders out into the world, then for this, ultimately, we need Turkey. It will also give us the opportunity to be firm and clear in our dealings with Turkey, which is exactly what is required. Only then will we succeed in setting a democratisation process in motion in order to succeed in our overall purpose. Jens Geier,

Madam President, President Caldeira, Commissioner Šemeta, ladies and gentlemen, I would like to begin by thanking the Court of Auditors for presenting this annual report, our most important tool in the discharge procedure for the Commission’s budget. My sincere thanks for this transparent report, which I believe will do much to help us more forward.  This report makes it clear that for the 18th
 time in succession, there can only be a limited statement of assurance for the work of the Commission, and as Mr Pieper has already said, the trend towards an improving error rate year on year has stopped. This House abides by its demand, however: what we want to see is a clear trend towards an improving error rate in the implementation of the EU budget. We are not prepared to accept the present situation. The Court of Auditors’ annual report also sends out a clear message to the Council, however, which is meeting this evening in order to find a compromise for the multiannual financial framework. Poorly functioning management and control systems in the Member States, overdue financial corrections at a high level, unnecessarily complicated rules in the Member States: anyone who wants better spending and does not use this as camouflage for cuts can start here. Anyone who wants better spending must improve the controls in the Member States, not cut the budgets. Anyone who wants better spending must also do their homework in their own country, for in Germany, the Netherlands and the United Kingdom, the control systems, according to the Court of Auditors and the Commission, are only effective to a limited extent. What concerns us about budget management in 2011 is that in some areas of the budget, the figures have got worse, as Mr Pieper has already pointed out. In research policy, for example – an area of the budget that is, in fact, directly administered by the Commission – the error rate has doubled from 1.4 to 3 %. Here, we must demand a plan of action from the Commissioner for Research, setting out how the Commission intends to reduce these error rates. In the common agricultural policy, the error rate generally hovered around the materiality threshold of 2 %. Now, the Court of Auditors estimates the error rate in rural development to be an incredible 7.7 %, meaning that spending on rural development has by far the highest error rate of any area investigated.  We cannot be consoled by the explanation that the programmes in the Member States have now reached full maturity, or by the explanation that the number of development projects is also increasing, so the errors are rising as well. No, what we want to see here is a remedy, and the Directorate-General for Agriculture and Rural Development and Commissioner Cioloş should be resolute in their efforts to move Member States towards better controls, as has already been achieved in regional policy. This is a good example of how tackling the causes can have a positive effect. The figure of 6 % for erroneous payments as a proportion of the total is still too high but the trend is moving in the right direction. The action plan adopted in 2008 has done much to improve the situation by greatly increasing the Commission’s supervision of the national management and control systems. Commissioner Cioloş should therefore start by seeking ideas for his own action plan to reduce the growing error rates in agricultural policy as well. There is room for improvement in regional policy too. We want retrospective projects to be removed from funding at last. We want the Directorate-General for Regional Policy to take the same robust action as the Directorate-General for Employment by suspending and cancelling funding programmes if Member States cannot guarantee proper and lawful control, and we want net corrections: Member States should only be able to transfer funds to other projects if they themselves detect errors in project management. If they are unable to detect the errors themselves, as is so often the case, the funding should revert to the Commission. Jens Geier,  
deputising for the rapporteur.

 Madam President, I am standing in, today, for Ms Ayala Sender, who is in Algeria as part of an electoral observers’ delegation and is thus unable to act as rapporteur for discharge of the other institutions. Let me start with the good news: we intend to move that the majority of the other institutions should be discharged. We had difficulty with the granting of discharge to the Economic and Social Committee because, although various requirements of the European Parliament in relation to questions of travel expenses claims and similar problems that attract a great deal of interest in the media have been met, we are somewhat concerned to find that there have been some differences of opinion within the Committee in relation to certain decisions on appointments – I trust you will understand my wish to choose my words with care here. The rapporteur has expressed her concerns in relation to this issue at Committee level and we shall continue to monitor the situation. However, this will not prevent us from requesting discharge. In the case of the Council, the situation is slightly different. Firstly, I would like to express my satisfaction and pleasure to find that the Danish Council Presidency is doing us the honour of following this debate. This is a first in all my time as a Member of his House. This is an encouraging sign that we are moving away from the phase where the institutions simply ignored one another during debates. I will return to this point at the end of my remarks. Each year, we find ourselves in a situation reminiscent of ‘Groundhog Day’. In other words, we start the business of discharging the Council for its management of the budget, or at least for the portion that involves European Union resources – in other words, the general budget funds. We assess the documents and we ask pertinent questions. The Council never gives any answers, however. Instead, we have received an offer from the Council to negotiate an interinstitutional agreement. This is something to be welcomed from my point of view at least because I have a difficulty when I find the Secretaries-General of the two institutions negotiating with one another, despite the fact that they do not have a political mandate – please do not take this personally Mr Welle – because, in my opinion, they have failed to pay enough attention to the aspirations, wishes and positions of the responsible Committee. Thus, we have a proposal for an interinstitutional agreement on the table and the position of my group in this House is that we should put the opportunities offered by this interinstitutional agreement to the test. Unfortunately we are in the minority here, because most of my fellow Members believe that the documents describe the functions adequately. At this point, I would like to emphasise once again that the Group of the Progressive Alliance of Socialists and Democrats does not wish to reduce the rights and responsibilities of the discharge authority, but that it would like to see how far we can get with the Council if we follow the strategy of negotiating this interinstitutional agreement. The main problem is reciprocity, as the Council insists that it should be allowed to examine Parliament’s auditing process, adopting the same high-handed approach as it takes to answering our questions to the Council. One more thing, Madam President; the bottom line for Parliament is that we cannot accept a situation where civil servants from the Member States control the public representatives who express the will of the citizens of Europe. Everything else is open to negotiation, so perhaps we shall succeed in making a little progress today. Jens Geier  (S&amp;D

Madam President, Ms Andreasen has just asked the European taxpayer to stop paying money to Brussels because, supposedly, no one is interested in spending practices. Exactly the opposite is true. This House is extremely interested in the spending practices of the EU institutions and what happens with the European taxpayers’ money. The problem is that our conclusions are different from those of Ms Andreasen. The Group of the Progressive Alliance of Socialists and Democrats certainly comes to very different conclusions in relation to the situation of the European agencies. Let me give you a brief run-down based on the example of the European Medicines Agency (EMA). Thanks to the work of our rapporteur of last year, Mr Stavrakakis, the EMA now has the strictest ‘Conflict of interest’
 system in Europe. The rapporteur for the European People's Party (Christian Democrats) has come to the conclusion that this is not enough and suggests that the discharge should be deferred, arguing that this system must first prove itself. This is precisely the opposite of the burden of proof outlined by Ms Herczog in her contribution. Ms Macovei, if the effectiveness of this system is to be put to the test, then this is the job of the next rapporteur, Mr Gerbrandy from the Group of the Alliance of Liberals and Democrats for Europe. If we find that the system does not work, then we can fine-tune it. However, to insist that an agency should not be discharged until the system has proven itself is to turn the burden of proof on its head. At this point, I fail to understand your claim that you are not seeking to damage the agency. The damage has already been done. We simply need to take a look at how the media has reported on your report, questioning the independence of stakeholders or experts in the agencies. You have already inflicted the damage that you say you wanted to avoid. We do indeed have a problem. The problem is that we cannot find independent rapporteurs or experts because you will find it difficult to identify university lecturers who have not worked for industry in the past. It is also the function of the agencies to cooperate with the private sector. Perhaps we really do need absolute clarity in declarations, separation of responsibilities and regulations. This cannot be achieved by deferring the discharge, however, Ms Macovei. For this reason, we will not be supporting your report. Jens Geier  (S&amp;D
),

 Mr Bradbourn, I share many of the opinions you have expressed. I have one question for you, however, in light of the judgment of the European Court of Auditors that the United Kingdom is responsible for 10% of the errors in cohesion policy: what is the Conservative Party of Great Britain doing to eliminate this mismanagement by British administrative authorities? Jens Geier,  
rapporteur.
 – (DE)
 Mr President, Mr Ehrenhauser, that fits in very nicely inasmuch as I can answer your question straight away. It is quite clear to me that, at this juncture, it is not a question of refusing discharge. However, if the rapporteur for the discharge in respect of the agencies raises accusations against the agencies, some of which lie outside the responsibility of these institutions, because the staffing of certain bodies, which you rightly described as excessive, is the responsibility of the Member States, then in October, the only option will be to refuse discharge, because this situation will not have changed, because the Member States will not have altered their behaviour with regard to the agencies. Therefore, the political instrument is not the appropriate one. The Group of the Progressive Alliance of Socialists and Democrats in the European Parliament really is now the last not to take the conflicts of interest seriously. The case just mentioned by Commissioner Šemeta is one that once again throws some pertinent light on the situation. However, the problem will not be resolved by postponing discharge. In committee, I have repeatedly argued that, to resolve the issue, we must wait for the report from the European Court of Auditors, which President Caldeira has, thankfully, informed us about, in order to reach conclusions based on a more thorough knowledge of the facts, which we can then also discuss in a serious debate. I am on the point of making accusations about certain situations, such as the issue that you also mentioned concerning the choice of seats of the agencies. In a press statement, I myself have criticised the fact that the UK Government is forcing one agency to establish its offices in Canary Wharf. That is the most expensive property market that the European Union has to offer. This is the same government that is proposing that the EU make savings. It really must start with its own decisions. Thus, with regard to the question of whether the criticism is justified, there is far less disagreement than there perhaps appears to be. The arguments relate to the question of what the political response to this should be. Jens Geier,  
rapporteur.

 Madam President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, are there 111 774 or 125 218 officers serving in Afghanistan’s national police force? This question remains to be answered. That is one of the problems that we encounter when we examine the issue of the use of EU aid in Afghanistan. This question is not inconsequential, as the salaries of the Afghan police officers are paid through the Law and Order Trust Fund for Afghanistan (LOTFA), which was set up by the United Nations Development Programme. LOTFA is the largest recipient of financial aid in Afghanistan. We do not know how many police officers there are because the databases of the Afghan police force are unreliable. Up to now, the European Union has provided funds to Afghanistan via three different channels. There is the use of private contracting partners which fulfil contracts issued by the European Commission. There are non-governmental organisations and there are the multi-donor trust funds, the largest being maintained by the United Nations, and there is another important one that was set up by the World Bank for the development of Afghanistan. These are the channels through which the European Union’s projects in Afghanistan, which must meet a number of criteria, are financed. They are to ensure the visibility of the European Union in Afghanistan. They are to support capacity building in the public administration. They must not be vulnerable to corruption. They must be sustainable. They are to be aligned with the regional priorities, but also with the priorities of the government. If we examine the strengths and weaknesses of the channels through which we transfer funds to Afghanistan, then we see that not all of the criteria can be met via any one channel, but that each of the different channels that the European Union uses to transfer funds to Afghanistan has its own particular strengths, but also its own particular risks. Two of the important objectives, namely, capacity building in the public administration and alignment with the priorities of the government, cannot be met at all via the channels used up to now. In my report, I therefore propose that we use a fourth channel, one that is now used for Afghanistan by many donors in the international community although not as yet by the European Union, and that is the channel of direct budget support to the Afghan state. This direct support to the Afghan budget brings with it a number of problems. One of these became very clear in media reports when it was found that cash – dollars in this case – was immediately being taken out of Afghanistan by the box-load, and I am pleased to be able to say at this point that, if these boxes contained any European funds at all, it would have only been a very small amount. With their direct budget support, the Americans had to learn a very expensive lesson in using this channel. However, they have learnt that lesson. They are proceeding step by step. They are taking it department by department of the Afghan ministries and ensuring that certain criteria are met, namely, that management and control systems are employed, that there are mechanisms for combating corruption in place, and that accountability to the Afghan Parliament is ensured. I believe that if the European Commission were to follow the same path, that is to say, take a step-wise approach, set clear goals for the Afghan Government that are retrievable and possible to monitor, ensure that there is accountability to the Afghan Parliament and – I believe this is very important – a truly independent Afghan court of auditors, then we can also support the use of this channel. After the withdrawal of the military, there will be a greater need for civilian aid. We must therefore ensure that this aid functions in a targeted, effective and sustainable way and that the funds provided by the European Union are protected against corruption and waste. That is in the best interests not only of European taxpayers, but of Afghanistan, too. Jens Geier,

 Mr President, Mr Caldeira, Mr Šemeta, ladies and gentlemen, the overall error rate for spending from the EU budget was 3.7%. This figure is too high. A resolution by this House based on the Liberadzki report calls for this figure to be constantly reduced. I am concerned that the Court of Auditors’ annual report for the financial year 2010 shows that the trend is being reversed. After three years of falling error rates, the figure is now increasing again. Unfortunately, European regional policy is once again responsible, because the error rate in this area rose from 5.5 to 7.7%. Interestingly, information from the European Commission shows that the United Kingdom is in third place behind Spain and Italy in the list of states where the most errors take place. We know that errors are being made because of divided management in the Member States and we know which Member States are responsible. Therefore, we are calling on the Commission to focus on monitoring activities in these countries. The Commission must suspend or interrupt the programmes, but the error rate must come down. If we look at revenue, it is clear that one eighth of the European budget is made up of income from external tariffs. The Member States are also failing to fulfil their obligations in this area. Duties are not being levied efficiently and once again Italy and the United Kingdom, together with the Netherlands, are the main culprits. I would like to thank the European Court of Auditors, you, Mr Caldeira and all your staff for this important document, which we will make detailed use of in the forthcoming discharge procedure.

 Mr President, President-in-Office of the Council, Commissioner Lewandowski, ladies and gentlemen, it is of course also appropriate at this point for we shadow rapporteurs to express our thanks and appreciation to the two rapporteurs from this House. They delved so deeply into the subject that sometimes we could no longer see them. My compliments on this splendid work. In connection with the Financial Regulation, we are also discussing Article 56, which deals with shared management. In the European Union, that is particularly important in regional policy and represents the second largest budget area. It represents the acid test for whether the Member States really are serious about the prudent use of EU funds, about which we have heard so much in the budget debates this morning. We see that, since 1994, there has been a total of more than EUR 7 billion in financial corrections in this area. We also see that, in 2010 alone, there was more than EUR 250 million in repayments to the EU budget – funds that were misspent in the Member States. At this point, I would like once again to recall the fact that EUR 250 million is more than the European Parliament wants to mobilise by means of the Flexibility Instrument. All I can say, Mr Dominik, is that when you next visit in the Council, please convey a message from the Committee on Budgets: we want our money back! What has been proposed in terms of audits and better control procedures in the Financial Regulation within the framework of Article 56 will help in this regard. I will be interested to see how the Council responds to this. Jens Geier,  
on behalf of the S&amp;D Group.

 Madam President, Mr Dominik, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, the question of discharge for the Council has been an institutional bone of contention between Parliament and the Council for years. According to our interpretation, the process is governed by Article 319 of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union, which governs the discharge of the Commission’s budget, and the corresponding article in the Financial Regulation. So far, the Council has not been in agreement with this view. It presently argues that, as it uses operational funding from the Commission’s budget, it is also discharged along with the Commission’s budget. I do not wish to repeat the statements and positions that I and the other members of the Committee on Budgetary Control have heard from the Council in this connection. All I would say is that there have been many of them and, in my view, they have not always been coherent. I think it is an important development that the Council is now ready to negotiate at a political level, rather than at the level of the Secretaries-General – who I do not believe have sufficient political mandate for this – as it informed us by means of a letter following the Committee on Budgetary Control’s decision on the granting of discharge to the Council. I would like to express my sincere thanks to the Presidency of the Council for this new offer. I take the view that we should take up this offer of negotiations with the highest-ranking negotiating delegation we can muster. I also believe that we should not go into the negotiations with predetermined ideas. I therefore recommended to my group that we should abstain at this point.

 Mr Søndergaard, I am happy to give you the answer to this, which is that these are simply rumours. At this point, I could simply fall back on the position of not commenting on rumours. However, I have just presented our group’s position, namely, that we are going to abstain at this juncture in order to enable negotiations to take place with the Council on a level not encumbered with predetermined ideas. We acted in a similar way when it came to your discharge report for the Council. Jens Geier  (S&amp;D
).

 Mr President, I would like to issue an explanation of vote on behalf of the Group of the Progressive Alliance of Socialists and Democrats in the European Parliament. The question of the granting of discharge for the Council by the European Parliament has been an institutional bone of contention for years. The Council and Parliament have not yet managed to resolve this issue amicably. The European Parliament bases its argument for its right to grant discharge on Article 319 of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union, and the corresponding articles in the Financial Regulation. It goes without saying that the S&amp;D Group shares this position. We insist on Parliament’s right to monitor and evaluate the proper use of taxpayers’ money by the Council. So far, the Council has not been in agreement with this view. At present, the Council argues that it is granted discharge along with the Commission budget. The S&amp;D Group does not share this view. We want to see a clear and balanced procedure that has been negotiated with the Council and that sets out the rights and obligations of the institutions. We are convinced that we should take the negotiated route first. This is because the non-granting of discharge to the Council will have no impact, as the EU Treaty does not provide for any consequences for such an occurrence. However, since the non-granting of discharge remains legally without consequence, the S&amp;D Group decided to abstain. Jens Geier,  
rapporteur for the opinion of the Committee on Regional Development
. – (DE)
 Madam President, I would like to use a minute now as rapporteur for the opinion of the Committee on Regional Development and then speak for two minutes later in the debate on behalf of my group. Madam President, Mr Becsey, Commissioner Šemeta, President Caldeira, ladies and gentlemen, the regional policy budget remains the Achilles heel of the European Union general budget. Five percent of payments from the European Regional Fund still have errors and must therefore be described as irregular payments. Even some of the payments that appear to be correct are actually supporting grotesque projects. May I remind you that an Elton John concert in Naples was subsidised by the European Regional Fund. It was said to be a measure to promote tourism. That might be the case, but in my opinion real regional aid for Naples should take a different form. The reason for this is that all too often the Member States still consider funding from the European Regional Fund to be soft money. This is obvious from the fact that there is a backlog of repayments due from irregular payments, from the fact that very often the Commission has to use the instrument of suspending payments – something that, as budget controllers, we expressly welcome – and from the fact that the punctuality of reporting suffers. The Director General for Regional Policy cannot provide us with any assurance as to the legality and reliability of over half the operational programmes because the reporting by the Member States is inadequate. Ladies and gentlemen, we still have a lot to do here. Jens Geier  (S&amp;D
).

 Mr President, I would like to thank Mr Ulmer for his noticeably factual contribution. It makes a pleasant contrast to many of the things that I have heard said about the agencies this morning. It is extremely depressing that many of the Members from the Eurosceptic parts of this House can never think of anything else but the agencies when it comes to budget cuts. May I remind you that when these agencies were allocated it seemed that the prime ministers and governments of the Member States of the European Union could not get enough of these agencies on their soil. Yet now people are acting as if they are the scourge of the European Union. I am very pleased at the announcement of a study by the European Court of Auditors into the management costs of the agencies. I believe it will provide us with a basis to at last have a more objective debate. I am delighted – as I said previously in my first contribution – that the representatives of the Hungarian Presidency are here with us this morning. That is not something we can take for granted when there is a debate that includes the discharge of the Council. I would therefore like to address you directly, Mr Becsey. I am pleased that the Council is prepared to recognise – as I took from the comments made by Mr Deutsch – that the budget proceedings and the discharge procedure must be dealt with differently. This European Parliament is the people’s representation and it demands accountability for the use of taxpayers’ money. We will therefore not shirk from demanding that the Council be held accountable for the money given to the Council from the Community budget to finance its work. Of course, there is plenty that we could negotiate on, such as what form the discharge procedure should take in the future. However, I should like to ask you whether you seriously expect the European Parliament to negotiate on something that is our right under the treaties. After all, that could only result in this right being restricted. I fail to see why I, as a Member of the European Parliament, would do that. Unfortunately, we do not have many opportunities to discuss things together and I would be delighted if you would take this opportunity to make it clear to us for once who it is in the Council that is actually fighting against the necessary transparency. Jens Geier  (S&amp;D

 Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, when I listen to the debate on the House of European History, it seems to me that there are only two types of Members in this House: the budget specialists, who attend this debate and who are largely critical of this project, and everybody else, who seem to find the whole thing to be just fine. The worst thing here is that when it comes to the issue of the House of European History there are so many cooks that people have actually lost sight of the point of the whole exercise. Thus, the Daily Telegraph today reported that documents have come into its possession indicating that the cost of this project has risen to the astronomical figure of GBP 137 million. I can only invite the Daily Telegraph to forward these documents to the Committee on Budgets and to let us see from it some of the transparency that the press demands from the Members of this House. I would welcome an opportunity to examine the evidence. Does this project make sense? Naturally it makes sense to foster an awareness of what the European Union and European integration have meant for people’s lives. Should a parliament operate a museum? No, definitely not. That is why the Group of the Progressive Alliance of Socialists and Democrats in the European Parliament have followed two guiding principles on this project. The first is: we demand that the project should have a business plan. The second is: we want clarity on the follow-up costs, that is, how this project is to be funded going forward. We might add a third principle: we should avoid any duplications or overlaps between the Infocentre and the House of European History. Jens Geier,

 Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, Commissioner Šemeta, We know that 80% of the EU budget is administered in a shared management arrangement, which means that money is administered and spent in the Member States, which is exactly where the errors, irregularities and fraud occur. The annual report on the protection of the European Union’s financial interests is a bit like the Member States’ list of sins, which is why I would like to thank Mr Cătălin Sorin and the shadow rapporteurs from the other groups for their hard work. I found the Commission’s report on the protection of the European Union’s financial interests contains one remarkable sentence – on page 11 in the German version. It reads: ‘For the Objective 2 programmes, the very high irregularity rates of the UK and the Netherlands, which mainly benefit from this type of programmes, may have influenced the overall rate.’ The United Kingdom and the Netherlands are two of the countries that have proposed cutting the European budget. From my position I can only call on them to make sure that European taxpayers’ money is spent correctly and to combat the level of irregularities in their countries. I would be very interested to hear whether you have anything else to add in this context, Commissioner. Jens Geier  (S&amp;D

Madam President, Commissioner Lewandowski, ladies and gentlemen, this morning we are debating the need to make savings in view of the debt crisis that we are experiencing in the Member States. Mrs Trüpel and others have quite rightly pointed out that this debt crisis affects us only indirectly, as it is not permitted for debts to be incurred at European level. Yet how can we pursue an austerity policy in the European Union if the volume of European expenditure is only 2% of the total public expenditure of all 27 Member States? I believe that this is not an austerity policy at all. Instead, it is a question of symbols – symbols that are in some way passed to us by the Member States as if money that is transferred to Brussels for the European budget in effect disappears into a deep black hole. This completely ignores the fact that the funds that go into the European budget actually go back to the Member States again. Of course, they do not go back at a ratio of 1:1, as Europe is not a savings bank, and we naturally pursue a policy of solidarity where we support those in the European Union that are less well developed. For example, in my state of North Rhine-Westphalia in Germany, all of the labour market instruments that are now implemented there are cofinanced by the European Social Fund. If we remove this funding, there will be correspondingly less labour market policy. That cannot be what Social Democrats are aiming for. Let us consider for a moment how the Member States spend European funds. The Court of Auditors’ annual report states that there are deficiencies in the way the management and control systems for spending European funds operate. It states that the recovery of wrongly invested funds in the Member States runs into billions of euro. It also states that the Commission is now, thankfully, going to suspend payments in cases where European programmes are being mismanaged. That is also happening for example in Germany and the United Kingdom. The Council, which is not here, represents the Member States, which I urgently call on to improve their management of EU budgetary resources. The increase in efficiency that this would make possible would allow us to considerably improve the way we spend EU funds – not by spending more money but by improving the way we spend it. The Member States can play a part in this in order to underline their willingness to make savings. Jens Geier  (S&amp;D
).

 Madam President, Mr Lewandowski, ladies and gentlemen, naturally, we should discuss the costs that are to be avoided or saved in this budget. However, I would call on you all to be a little more objective in your knee-jerk responses to the discussion in relation to the agencies. Why is this? Firstly, because the Committee on Budgetary Control is permanently engaged in this debate and also draws attention to ways in which cooperation between the agencies and the performance of their duties can be improved, and also because we are expecting a special report on the agencies this year from the European Court of Auditors and will then have a more objective basis for what is, at present, a somewhat ill-considered discussion, particularly with regard to the question of how the agencies are managed and how we may be able to achieve these savings. Speaking of savings, I would like to come to my next topic, our building policy. The fact is that when it comes to the buildings of the European Union, we can certainly save resources. Speaking personally, I would question whether it is really a good idea to build new buildings for the European Parliament in Brussels because this strategy really only makes sense if real estate prices in Brussels continuously rise. At present, the market would not seem to support this. If real estate prices on the market do not rise, then the option of renting rather than buying really does make sense, particularly when you walk around the European quarter with your eyes open and see how much office space is actually available to rent in the area. Which brings me to the issue of the House of European History. I believe that greater legitimacy is required here because it is not enough that to date, all the initiatives for the establishment of the House of European History are simply based on resolutions by the Bureau of this House and have no democratic legitimacy. This needs to change. Above all, we need to know how the operating costs and follow-up costs of this institution are to be covered. Jens Geier  (S&amp;D

 Mr President, Commissioner Barnier, ladies and gentlemen, we all know that the European Union does not have the best reputation. This often results from the fact that workers do not feel that the balance between freedom and security is protected or that it needs to be restored in many areas. This can be seen, for example, in the Services Directive, since it is an important driver of the internal market but also throws a spotlight on the limitations of that market at the same time. The review is therefore important. It is a complex task, and one to which Mrs Gebhardt has provided absolutely outstanding answers. There are still some challenges to be overcome, however. The Services Directive must not, under any circumstances, undermine the fundamental principle of equal pay for equal work in the same location. We must therefore carefully ensure, through all the monitoring opportunities that have been made available to us, that cross-border services, too, do not violate this principle. The point of single contact must provide fair access to the market of the country in which the service is to be provided. However, this is not only for the service providers themselves and the companies, for whom in my home city of Essen, for example, there are six officials – for four towns – who feel responsible. It is also for the workers. In that regard, it is absolutely crucial what language these points of single contact speak. In the Committee on Regional Development, we had a fairly hopeless discussion on this. In my view, the languages of the neighbouring countries should be used. Jens Geier  (S&amp;D

 Madam President, Mr Almunia, ladies and gentlemen, I would like to refer briefly to two points. One of them concerns competitiveness, which is raised in a number of different areas of the report. I would like to ask you to remember how many mining accidents we hear about in the media. This is due to the fact that mining and, in particular, coal mining is going on all over the world, but unfortunately, the safety standards elsewhere are very low when compared with those in German or other European pits. This may seem like overstating the case, but personally, I do not think much of competitiveness which is bought at the expense of miners’ lives. However, if we are looking at the consequences for industrial policy of an early exit from coal mining, I would like to say that the European mining equipment industry is competitive. I would like to invite all those people who believe that mining is an industry of the past and, in particular, Mr Klinz, to pay a visit to a mine. They will soon realise that mining uses high-tech solutions and that it is a question of whether or not we want this industry to continue to be profitable. I know that this is not what the Group of the Alliance of Liberals and Democrats for Europe wants. I am afraid that the mining machinery industry will follow mining production and move out of Europe. Jens Geier  (S&amp;D

Madam President, I would like to ask Mr van Dalen whether he is aware that the high percentages refer only to the percentage of the sample. In other words, it is not 36% of the payments that are in error, but 36% of the payments in the sample. If this is extrapolated up, the result is at least 5% in the case of the Cohesion Fund. Therefore, the billions that you referred to are not accurate amounts. Were you aware of this? Jens Geier  (S&amp;D
).

 Madam President, Mr Caldeira, Mr Šemeta, cohesion policy is the sick man of the EU budget. Last year, he was in intensive care and this year he is convalescing. However, he is far from making a full recovery and he could have a relapse at any time. More than 5% of all the cohesion policy payments were in error and 3% should not have been made at all. This amounts to around EUR 700 million. A large proportion of these erroneous payments could have been prevented by the Member States. The errors are occurring in public procurement and in the payment of cohesion funding, despite the existing control systems, which have been approved by the Commission. We need to take another careful look at these control systems. In my home country of Germany, the samples showed that all the control systems there which had been tested were only partially effective. The responsibility for managing the budget lies with the Commission. We can discuss this contradiction – errors in the Member States which are the responsibility of the Commission – in our home countries, we can explain it to the media and we can tell our citizens about it. However, in political terms, it is the job of the Commission to resolve this problem in the Member States. Mr Šemeta, you need to take control in this area and you will have our support for doing so.

Madam President, Mr Oettinger, as rapporteur for the opinion of the Committee on Budgets concerning Mrs Van Brempt’s report, I can say that the members of the committee very much welcomed this report. We have looked at it not only from a budgetary perspective, but also, to certain extent, with regard to its content and we have raised one concern, which Mrs Van Brempt was kind enough to include. This instrument is aimed at municipalities and rightly so, because this is where the greatest increases in efficiency can be achieved. However, I come from an area of Germany where the municipalities cannot take out any additional loans, because they are already too heavily in debt. This may be a problem specific to Germany, because of our local authority constitutions, but Mr Oettinger, as a former head of a Federal German state, will be only too familiar with this subject. Therefore, in Germany, we are in a position where those local authorities which should be making use of this programme are not allowed to, because the body responsible for supervising them has prevented them from taking on any further debt. We are very concerned about this. It could result in this programme being ineffective in these areas. We welcome this programme and would be pleased if it could be continued. We have called for the programme to have a separate budget line and we would like to transfer to it the EUR 15 million available in the agricultural policy area which cannot be accessed there because there is no legal basis for doing so. This is where the budget needs to be more flexible. Jens Geier  (S&amp;D

 Madam President, Mr Wathelet, Commissioner, I believe that we are all agreed, even the gentlemen and the few ladies among the Eurosceptic to anti-Europe fractions of this House, that the EU performs important tasks and that the performance of these tasks represents European added value, because the nation states either cannot perform them or the final beneficiaries would not receive this money from the nation states. The latter scenario is due, in particular, to the fact that the Member States would not invest savings, but would have to use them to reduce debt, whereas the European budget is largely an investor. Thus, if we want to achieve the goals that are set here every week, we need an ambitious budget, and that means not less money, but more money in future. In this connection, I believe it is important to emphasise that the national budgets and the European budget are complementary to one another. The Council and the Member States behave as if money that goes into the European budget more or less disappears into a large black hole. That is not the case; it is invested in goals that we have previously agreed on here. We therefore also need, as Mr Böge proposes, a critical examination of the medium-term financial programme. This, of course, can only serve to show that the Council cannot say ‘yes’ to the Treaty of Lisbon while, at the same time, putting forward one or other project for financing and then saying: but you will not get any money for its implementation. If it is not possible, then we will resort to the necessary deletions of the budget lines that Parliament does not regard as priorities. Ladies and gentlemen, we will have this discussion again and again while the EU does not have sufficient funds of its own. What is important – no, essential – is that these own resources do not impose an additional burden on normal wage earners. As a Social Democrat, I am in favour of the introduction of a financial transaction tax, because in general, this will not affect normal wage earners and it will help to put the brakes on the financial market. We firmly believe that those who triggered a crisis, the like of which we have never seen before, and the costs of which we all have to pay out of the public budgets of our own Member States, should be called on to compensate for these losses.

 Mr President, Mr Barroso, Mr Zapatero, from the point of view of those in charge of budgetary control in this House, the Spanish Presidency has made history. We are grateful that this Presidency has succeeded in removing the discharge procedure for the Council from the sphere of obscurity. Previously, the Council has refused to lay adequate accounts before the European Parliament. Sessions had, at best, an informal character. One had to collect documents bit by bit, or they were unavailable. Answers to questions were unsatisfactory. The Council would refer in all seriousness to an agreement dating from 1970, the ‘gentlemen’s agreement’, which allegedly clarifies issues concerning the discharge, although this gentlemen’s agreement spares not a single word on this matter. This has now changed. The Secretary-General of the Council has agreed to introduce a discharge procedure worthy of the name in a transparent procedure in compliance with democratic standards. This success of the Spanish Presidency testifies to the democratic and European convictions of the Spanish Government. For this, it deserves the praise of this House. Jens Geier  (S&amp;D

 Mr President, Mr Maystadt, Mr Rehn, I would first like to thank Mr Deutsch for his work. However, I would also like to take the opportunity to emphasise the importance of the European Investment Bank (EIB) for Europe and for the citizens of Europe and to highlight the fact that we must make greater use of this unique institution, in particular in times of economic crisis. From the perspective of budgetary control, which in modern terms also covers the actual output and performance of European programmes and institutions, the EIB has definitely earned its high rating, in particular with regard to political reliability. It creates real added value for the people of Europe by means of the investments made in its six main programmes, ranging from the Trans-European Networks to supporting small and medium-sized enterprises, and its special programmes, such as the project to combat climate change. I am sure that this will receive broad support in the European Parliament. However, this also means that Parliament must in future extend its own supervisory procedures. I am referring here, for example, to the investment facility. Finally, I would like to make one further point which is particularly important to my group and which is aimed directly at the EIB. We welcome the fact that the EIB has revised its policy on offshore financial centres. However, we also need the assurance that income produced from EIB funds will not make its way into tax havens of this kind, otherwise the EIB would risk damaging the reputation and the rating that it has built up. Jens Geier,

Good morning Mr President, ladies and gentlemen. I would like to repeat that, in my opinion, it is rather difficult to conduct a debate in the absence of those to whom we are supposed to grant discharge, with whom we want to discuss the reasons why we are granting discharge or are postponing discharge or whatever else we have to talk to them about. I know many of the honourable Members of this House from the committee. We also know our respective positions. It is fine that we will exchange them once again this morning, but it is not really helpful. In this context, I would like to propose that in committee, we deliberate formally inviting the institutions we are discussing to the next discharge debate and postponing the debates accordingly if they are not present. Discharge to the European institutions comes at a difficult, but important moment. A consequence of the financial crisis is that all governments are having to review their respective budgets and ensure that they are meeting their requirements. We are in the first year of a new legislative period of the European Parliament and are dealing with a newly assembled Commission. In terms of the discharge, we are, however, considering the 2008 budget, which was under the responsibility of the previous Commission. This opens a multitude of new perspectives. Among these new perspectives, we should expect a new way of thinking and a new approach on the part of the Member States since, for the first time, the Treaty of Lisbon names them as being co-responsible for the implementation of the EU budget. In terms of the 2008 budgetary review, it was the rapporteur’s intention to ensure that the Commission concentrates entirely on possibilities for improvement in budgetary control and that the Member States are on board for that as well. As the Group of the Progressive Alliance of Socialists and Democrats in the Committee on Budgetary Control, it is our goal that in future, every discharge report – on the basis of the judgment of the European Court of Auditors – is better than the previous one. It all depends on the Council assuming its new key roll in the light of the importance of the Member States. It would be equally helpful if the European Court of Auditors looked for ways of redressing the imbalance that is, on the one hand, the result of annual reporting and the multiannual duration of many EU programmes and the logic of their implementation by the Commission and the Member States. As the budgetary authority, we continue to have great concerns regarding some specific areas of responsibility, and, in particular, those in which the EU intends to implement its political priorities. For example, cohesion in the European Union is essential and therefore, the funds that flow into structural policy are particularly important. Here, we need to continue combating sources of errors decisively through simpler rules and recovering funds wrongly paid. We need finer instruments to measure results and we call on the Court of Auditors to develop these instruments, in order to be able to identify precisely the sources of errors. We know that the action plan for the structural funds that provides for recovery is finally being implemented and we must now wait for it to have an effect. Pre-accession aid has the goal of enabling fundamental processes of change in these states and problems in target setting and implementation must be remedied. What will not do, however, is the fact that the goal of the accession process is effectively being torpedoed through the back door. Therefore, I call on the House to reject the attempt by the Group of the European People’s Party (Christian Democrats) to use amendments to turn the position of the European Parliament on Turkey’s accession process on its head, as recorded in the resolution on the progress report. We are looking forward to the appointment of a new Director-General of the European Antifraud Office (OLAF) to end the ongoing debate, and also the Commission’s proposals on the reform of OLAF, in order to improve the crucial work of this office. Finally, to external policy actions. We need a demonstration of the determination of the EU to contribute to the resolution of problems worldwide. These actions must be highly effective, even under the most difficult circumstances. In the coming months, we must discuss the current management of EU funds in this area with the Commission and how these funds will be managed in future by the European External Action Service. We are, however, making some progress. Our group is particularly pleased with the steps the Commission is taking as regards the annual management reports of the Member States, for example, since we are thereby getting closer to the realisation of an old demand of the Group of the Progressive Alliance of Socialists and Democrats. The same is true for the financial corrections and recoveries, since this is also an opportunity to reduce an unacceptably high rate of errors. These points give us, among other things, the opportunity, some considerations notwithstanding, to call for the discharge of the Commission. I thank you and look forward to your comments. Jens Geier  (S&amp;D

Mr President, Commissioner, Mr López Garrido, I am delighted that you are here and so demonstrate the Council’s recognition of this important debate. Ladies and gentlemen, we all know this little trick: if you want to embarrass someone, ask them a question with a wording like, do you still actually smack your children? Even if the person says no, they have implicitly admitted that in the past, they did smack their children. The discharge report for Parliament by Mr Staes, who I would like to thank for his work, is a critical report, and to me, in some areas at least, it has followed this logic. Self-criticism is good, but it should then be accurate. I have had many discussions in my group on how we might reject this or that wording in the report on Parliament’s discharge. Some of us have come under more than a little pressure in our home countries regarding this. However, I do want to convey to you my answers to these questions as to why we have rejected some wording or other in the report on Parliament’s discharge. There are proposals that are already a reality. We could re-table them, but why? There are proposals that are not helpful, such as the idea of making the Committee on Budgetary Control a sort of alternative internal audit authority or an intermediary between the Bureau and plenary. There are many good proposals in this report that were, however, all adopted. Then there are proposals in this report that only represent a partial reality, as, for example, in Amendment 26 now on the table. This amendment demands the establishing of an internal control system in groups of this House. Nothing should be more obvious. In the Group of the Progressive Alliance of Socialists and Democrats, however, this has long been a reality, precisely for that reason. If my group were to agree to this, we would be acting as if we had some catching up to do. Therefore, we can, in this example, only agree if this reality is also illustrated in the report. I therefore propose adding the following phrase to this paragraph: as it is the fact in the S&amp;D Group. Jens Geier,  
deputising for the rapporteur.

Mr President, so that the Minutes are correct, I represent rapporteur Bogusław Liberadzki, who, like many others in this House, has been a victim of the transport problems this week. I am very happy to do so and would like to use the opportunity to go over a few of the remarks made during the debate. For a start, Commissioner Šemeta, to my great satisfaction, you have stressed that the Commission will take steps to further strengthen the accountability of the leading actors in the management of EU funds. We all know what that means. Indeed, we all know that it means that we must remind the Member States of the European Union that manage a large portion of European funds of their responsibility to do so in accordance with good practice, because we also all know that the majority of the errors that are made in the utilisation of European funds are made by the Member States and at this level. That is why it is also rather unsatisfactory to hear colleagues from the European Conservatives and Reformists Group and the Europe of Freedom and Democracy Group, all of whom, including Mr Czarnecki, have other commitments, strongly criticising the Commission in the debate and saying that the Commission will be refused discharge. I would have expected my fellow Members to support pushing for national management statements in this House and also in the Member States, because that is where mistakes are being made and there is insufficient cooperation. Then it is rather unsatisfactory to hear colleagues from the ECR Group say that everything that happens here is substandard – knowing quite well that responsibility lies somewhere else entirely. Once again, I would like to mention pre-accession aid, because I feel that a few things have to be put right there. I would like to remind you that the Committee on Budgetary Control supported the rapporteur with a slight majority. I would also like to remind you that during the reporting, the representative of the European Court of Auditors sought to remind the rapporteur that his report was about the behaviour of the Commission as regards what was deemed to be worthy of criticism, not about the behaviour of Turkey. Our fellow Members in the Group of the European People’s Party (Christian Democrats) have voted amendments into the discharge of the Commission that we would like to remove straightaway, because here it is obviously less about the utilisation of taxpayers’ money and more about the question of where accession negotiations with Turkey are going. Deciding that at this point is the wrong way to go. Jens Geier  (S&amp;D

 Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, I would like to draw the attention of the European Commission and of this House to the worrying developments with regard to the prices of raw materials. Duisburg, home of the largest steelworks in Europe, is in my constituency. Here, and in the other steel-producing locations in the EU, the employees are very concerned about their jobs because the three large suppliers of iron ore are forcing price increases of 100% on the steel industry. In future, the price of ore is to be traded on the London Metal Exchange instead of price security being ensured, as was previously the case, by means of long-term supply contracts. The workforce and its trade unions fear that this will result in an extreme rise in the price of the base material, steel. This comes at a time when the potential areas for savings by means of cost-cutting programmes and reductions in the workforce, particularly after the most recent restructuring in the steel industry, have been completely exhausted. In order to draw attention to this situation, works councils and Germany’s Industrial Union of Metalworkers have directed an appeal on behalf of Duisburg to Chancellor Merkel and to President Barroso. I would ask the Commission to respond to this appeal. Jens Geier  (S&amp;D

 – (DE)
 Mr President, Mr Kallas, Mr Caldeira, ladies and gentlemen, firstly I would like to thank you, Mr Caldeira, for your introduction and I would like to thank you and the members of the Court of Auditors for your report. Parliament will investigate carefully the information you have provided and will act on it in the coming months. I was pleased that the previously unacceptable error rate of the common agricultural policy has fallen. However, after reading the Court of Auditors’ report, I have the impression that one Member State, namely Romania, is responsible for the majority of the remaining irregularities. It seems that we must put more emphasis in future on training staff and implementing control systems correctly in the new Member States, if possible, before their accession. The European Structural Funds, which many of my fellow Members have already mentioned, represent another cause for concern. It is true that the number of irregular payments has fallen when compared with the previous year, but there are still huge problems in ensuring that aid funding is handled without irregularities occurring. I would like to say to the Eurosceptic parts of this House that we are talking about 11% of the total payments and not 11% of the budget. This amounts to EUR 2.7 billion and not EUR 5 billion. I admit that this is still EUR 2.7 billion too much, but we must be accurate for the sake of honesty. These irregularities relate mainly to excessive payments and the incorrect use of funds. For example, if European Social Fund (ESF) money is used to pay the salary of a public administrator or if European Regional Development Fund (ERDF) money is used to buy a building plot, then the people concerned obviously do not have sufficient information about the correct use of aid funding or the Member States do not have the will or the ability to administer the funding correctly, or perhaps all of the above. When we revise the application procedure, we must put in place clear, transparent rules which are easier to understand. The Member States must ensure that the applications are monitored more carefully at a national level. It is clear that any waste or any irregularities in relation to European taxpayers’ money is too much. However, anybody who takes an impartial look at the EU and at this report from the European Court of Auditors will find little cause for offence. It offers a number of starting points for our work, which consists of making Europe better and more efficient every day. On this basis we will implement the discharge procedure for the European Commission. Jens Geier  (S&amp;D
). 
 – (DE)
 Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I, too, would like to thank Mr Søndergaard for his successful work, as a result of which the Council ultimately accommodated Parliament in the discharge procedure. The Council refused, for a long while, to provide pertinent answers to Parliament’s questions, citing the Gentlemen’s Agreement – an agreement of an informal nature which is now, in any case, 40 years old. This seems downright bizarre when Council officials, after 40 years, clearly no longer know what exactly the Gentlemen’s Agreement states, since the version provided by the European Parliament contains precisely the opposite of what the Council claimed again and again in the negotiations. The first resolution of the Gentleman’s Agreement stated that the Council would not attempt to make any changes to the European Parliament’s expenditure. The third resolution states that there should be close cooperation between the two institutions on budget issues. The Council takes this to mean that each institution will leave the budgetary activity of the other alone. At this point, I will refrain from commenting on the seriousness of this line of argument. Instead, I would like to thank the Swedish Presidency of the Council for having begun the process of bringing an end to this ignoble state of affairs. The solution is an addendum to the interinstitutional agreement that clearly regulates the procedure for the granting of discharge to the Council by Parliament, as the proposed motion for a resolution demands. I therefore ask the House to support the motion. Jo Leinen  (S&amp;D

After 30 years of civil war there was a lot of chaos in Sri Lanka and colleagues have said that there are improvements but not enough. But you are speaking about a balanced resolution and you are calling for a comprehensive investigation by March 2014 – that is three months from now. Do you think that is realistic? Why do you impose such an ultimatum, rather than stating ‘in due time’, as you yourself said? March 2014 is completely unrealistic – do you not agree? Jo Leinen,

 Mr President, I am a member of Parliament’s delegation to India, and I love the people and the country. But, like all of us, I was shocked by the atrocity of this gang rape against a young student. Sexual violence against women is, unfortunately, a widespread phenomenon in India, especially in the capital, Delhi. The rape of this young girl is only the tip of the iceberg.  In our resolution we ask the Indian Government to investigate the cases of persons occupying senior official posts – up to the top levels of the Parliament and the government – against whom formal accusations of rape are outstanding, and call for those persons to give up their public functions. We call upon the Indian authorities to take effective measures to train police forces to handle rape cases better, and we call for the Indian criminal law to be amended to punish all forms of sexual assault. The European Union and the Member States should work with Indian authorities on special campaigns and programmes to combat gender-based violence. More has to be done to protect women and to implement Article 51 of the Indian Constitution, which forbids any practice against the dignity of women. Parliament’s delegation visits India in early May, and I am sure we will address this issue with our partners in the Indian Parliament. Jo Leinen  (S&amp;D

 Mr President, Mr Potočnik, in view of the enormous challenges facing nature and the environment, as well as the planet’s ecosystems, it must be admitted that the Rio conference is a missed opportunity. I see the glass as half empty rather than half full because the world continues to be ravaged and we have still failed to identify sufficient specific objectives and schedules or concrete obligations to enable us to change course in favour of sustainable development. The shift in power evident in Rio has been remarkable. It is interesting that an emerging economy like Brazil, supported by China and India, should present a document without there being the opportunity to change it. I would have liked to have seen more courage from Europe – acting together with the African Union perhaps – in support of the United Nations Environment Programme (UNEP), exerting more pressure so that the UNEP would become a UN organisation. What happens next? Of course we have our hopes. I believe that hopes spring from the grass roots: green cities and green business. The Rio conference hosted more mayors and more CEOs than any previous environmental summit. We should identify the urban environment as a focus area in the seventh EU Environmental Action Programme. The majority of people now live in cities, which is where the greatest amount of energy and most resources are consumed, providing a good starting point. The same applies to progressive enterprises. They have understood that it is only possible to do business when the fundamental structures for commerce are in place. We need to establish an alliance with green business. We in Parliament also need to take action. The UN has established eight major groups: business, urban areas, women, trade unions, etc. Parliaments also need to become more involved, which is why it was a pity that we did not have an official delegation at the conference. We should form a major group at UN conferences under the ‘parliaments’ banner. Jo Leinen  (S&amp;D

 Mr President, it is, in any case, a bad habit that we have here in Parliament that a text is read out for one or two minutes and people cannot speak on one or two thoughts without notes. That has annoyed me ever since I joined the European Parliament. However, I will use my time for the subject in hand. Mr Potočnik, you quite rightly described the 2050 energy road map as a great transformation for our economy and society, for production and consumption. For this great transformation, you need all the players, and at all levels. I think it is good that you are establishing a platform for resource efficiency in Brussels. We ought to have the same thing at the level of the Member States and the regions, right down to municipalities. My question is this: do you have a plan for this? Mr Bütikofer rightly asked about resource efficiency plans. That is the same subject. For climate protection, we have the National Adaptation Programmes of Action (NAPAs) and the Nationally Appropriate Mitigation Actions (NAMAs). Naturally, we also need resource efficiency plans here. Do you intend to present this to the Member States? Then, of course, you will need all the other portfolios. I will simply mention the finance ministers – this has already been mentioned: the phasing out of environmentally harmful subsidies, the incorporation of external costs into our tax system. How can we win over the finance ministers and, not least, the ministers for economic affairs? We need new business models that reward sustainability and not the consumption of resources. For that, we need to think about something new with the ministers for economic affairs. (The speaker agreed to take a blue-card question under Rule 149(8)) Jo Leinen  (S&amp;D

 Thank you for your follow-up question, Ms Merkies. In fact, the traditional business model is built upon the consumption, and even the wasting, of resources. The manufacturer produces something, does not deal with the waste, the product goes to the consumer and perhaps also ends up being thrown away. That is no longer acceptable. We need a new business model in which the manufacturer is responsible – from production through to recovery, to recycling. Then, I believe, there will be new designs for products. There are new responsibilities for recirculation. That is the direction we must move in. Jo Leinen,

 Mr President, Mr Potočnik, ladies and gentlemen, the European Parliament wants to introduce a 7th Environment Action Programme (EAP) in the European Union. It would not make sense for us to give up our efforts to improve the quality of the environment and of health in Europe when the 6th EAP comes to an end in June. However, the 7th EAP must not be a copy of the 6th programme. We have come much further along the road and we are facing much bigger challenges. We need to take a new approach in the 7th EAP: a horizontal approach covering all other areas of policy. We are exposed to systemic risks. Mr Potočnik, you have just mentioned the fact that climate change, the loss of biodiversity and the shortage of resources are all challenges which cannot be overcome by traditional environmental policy alone. We need to involve all the other portfolios and all the other policy areas in the EU and, in particular, energy and transport policy, agriculture and fisheries policy, cohesion policy and, most importantly, economic and financial policy. I would like to emphasise this point, because this is the most difficult aspect. How can we ensure that the finance and economy ministers treat greening as a central issue within their areas? Parliament has drafted 80 paragraphs containing proposals for the content and the procedure for a 7th EAP and these include calls for the abolition of subsidies which harm the environment. Following the greening of tax policy, we must incorporate external costs in our prices. The principle that the polluter pays must be applied gradually. As part of our macro-economic controls, we also need to monitor sustainability within the European Semester. We have come up with many other ideas in this area. Europe’s environmental footprint as a whole is far too large. If all the 7 billion people on this planet today and the 9 billion that there will be by the middle of the century were to use as much energy and as many resources as we do, we would need two planets, not just one. We know that there are limits to the resources which our planet can provide. For this reason, we need to make major cuts in our resource consumption. The 7th EAP must open the door to a green economy and to a policy of resource efficiency. We need to focus, in particular, on urban environments. More and more people are living in large conurbations and in these areas, we can set a good example of resource management and resource efficiency. Green cities are our objective in Europe. There are many good examples and best practices which must be applied everywhere. Of course, protecting the environment should also help us to protect people’s health. We must send out a clear message to the public that protecting the environment and public health form an integral part of the 7th EAP. This will help to ensure that it gains acceptance. There are still a number of difficulties in this area. Air pollution levels are still too high and noise pollution is a huge problem. Noise is an issue that has been neglected and completely underrated in our environmental policy. There are still many toxic chemicals that make their way into the environment and have an impact on health. Nanomaterials and other new materials need careful investigation and also present us with new challenges. The best legislation and the best programmes are useless if they are not implemented. The 7th EAP must resolve the problem of the implementation deficit. Ultimately, I believe that Europe must send a message to the world that we need sustainable management. Otherwise, the human race will not survive on earth. Jo Leinen,  
rapporteur.

 Mr President, the debate has shown that there is a consensus in favour of the 7th Environment Action Programme (EAP) within the European Parliament. I would like to thank all the shadow rapporteurs who have helped us to reach this consensus. I would also like to thank Mr Potočnik, who took the initiative within the Commission, because not everyone there supported the 7th EAP at first sight. It is clear that there was a certain level of resistance. Following the debate in the Council of Environment Ministers and in the European Parliament, it is clear how useful and how important a 7th EAP can be, because it brings together all the objectives which were previously spread across different strategies and road maps. The amalgamation of these objectives, the message that Europe’s environmental footprint must be reduced and the measures needed to achieve this are the main points of the 7th EAP. I would like to say once again that we need to address our calls to the finance and economy ministers. I hope that the report will not be watered down during the vote later today. We must call for the greening of tax policy and economic policy because we will not be able to make our economy sustainable by means of environmental policy alone. This point has been made in many of today’s speeches. The environmental strategy must be reflected in the finance strategy. We will soon be debating the medium-term financial plan up to 2020 and the Commission has proposed putting aside for climate change and sustainability 20% of the billions of euro available. I believe that this should be a minimum and I hope that Parliament can increase this figure during the negotiations. We must not allow 80% of the funding to be devoted to areas that go against the environment and only 20% to be used to protect the environment. Overall, this has been an important debate and we are looking forward to your draft, Mr Potočnik. This will go into the ordinary legislative procedure where it will be finalised. We will help to ensure that the result is an ambitious programme. Jo Leinen  (S&amp;D

 Mr Casini, would you agree that, if it accedes to the Convention on Human Rights, the EU must then support the provision of better facilities for the Court in Strasbourg? We know that the judges are completely overloaded and have poorer facilities than the judges in Luxembourg. The EU should – and I am asking you whether you agree with this – ensure that they have the same working conditions, the same standards and the same facilities, as then we can also hope for sound judgments. Would you come out in favour of Parliament and the EU supporting better facilities for the Court in Strasbourg? Jo Leinen,

 Mr President, Commissioner, climate protection requires immediate measures, as well as a long-term strategy if we are to achieve the objective of stabilising the Earth’s atmosphere at 2 °C. The Group of the Progressive Alliance of Socialists and Democrats in the European Parliament supports your Roadmap for 2050. It is an extremely important element in guaranteeing planning certainty and clarity in relation to where the path is to take us. All those involved, particularly the economic sector, eagerly await this planning certainty and clarity. This makes it all the more regrettable that Friday’s Environment Council meeting was blocked by one country, showing itself to be incapable of making political decisions. I would like to ask the Commission: what is your strategy for rescuing Poland from this psychological and political isolation? We need Poland. Poland is an important country. We need to make it clear that Poland also has enormous opportunities to modernise its economy and deploy new technology in pursuing its climate strategy. Perhaps it is necessary to clarify the assistance the EU can offer and the way in which the effort is distributed among all 27 countries, all of which share a common goal, but which may have different ways of reaching that goal. Commissioner, you must be able to provide an answer here. If we want to reduce CO2
 emissions by 80 to 95%, we need to embrace all sectors, not just industry, but also transport and agriculture. I hope that the amendments tabled here will not dilute our report. We need to speak out clearly in relation to climate neutrality in the transport sector and in favour of major efforts in the agricultural sector. We would encourage you to include not just aviation, but also marine transport in the emissions trading system. You need to show leadership here, and you should not give in. The Emissions Trading System is not working. You need to take corrective action. This report indicates how this can work. I believe, in the final analysis, that we are witnessing a new industrial revolution. The issue at stake is a competitive European economy and climate protection is a key element in the competitiveness of Europe in the 21st century. Jo Leinen  (S&amp;D

 Mr President, I am opposed to the motion. This is a complete surprise from the Group of the European People’s Party (Christian Democrats). We have discussed the motion in the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Food Safety. We have the advantage of excellent groundwork by the Committee on Industry, Research and Energy and the Committee on Agriculture and Rural Development and have discussed this in detail this morning. The Commission and industry at large must know how matters are to proceed with regard to climate protection. I am in favour of voting on this matter today. Jo Leinen,

 Mr President, Ms Hedegaard, the Group of the Progressive Alliance of Socialists and Democrats in the European Parliament would also like to congratulate you on your handling of the negotiations in Durban. The EU has demonstrated its strong leadership skills and this has paid off. I am also pleased about the climate diplomacy and the coalition of 120 states. I would like to see China joining our strategic coalition, alongside Africa. China is moving towards taking over worldwide responsibility. This would send out a signal to the US to bring an end to its policy of denial and to join the mainstream of international climate policy. We have prevented a fiasco and we have produced the road map which we will have to work on. There is, of course, a great deal for us to do at home. We have the gigatonne gap and if Europe wants to play a leading role, it will have to do more than it has in the past. I hope that there will be new initiatives which go beyond 20%. We must take the hot air out of Kyoto 2. The policy cannot really be credible with all these surplus certificates. I would like to encourage you to remain tough in the areas of aviation and shipping and to take new initiatives. It is totally absurd that the US Congress can pass a law banning airlines from taking part in our legislation. We must not allow this to happen and Parliament would like to see you maintaining your tough stance. Jo Leinen,

 Mr President, Ms Maćkowiak-Pandera, Ms Hedegaard, ladies and gentlemen, this week, the European Parliament is submitting a resolution which includes comprehensive proposals on combating global climate change. Mr President, I know that you are committed to overcoming climate change and it would, of course, be good if you could come with the parliamentary delegation to Durban. However, I understand the constraints you are under here in the House with regard to the 2012 budget. Nevertheless, a strong delegation will be going to Durban ready to exert pressure and to use its lobbying skills, so that the process of combating climate change does not come to a halt and so that we can continue to make progress. I would like to thank the sponsors from the five groups who have drawn up this resolution. There was a broad consensus in the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Food Safety about what should now be done and we had the support of the Committee on Development and the Committee on Industry, Research and Energy. Parliament has clear ideas about what we need to achieve in the 17th Conference of the Parties (COP 17) to the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC). We have no time to lose. The extreme weather events in 2011 alone and the melting of the glaciers and icebergs show that climate change is well under way. This is why we need to make substantial progress at the COP 17. Parliament’s goal remains the same: a legally binding instrument for all states in the UNFCCC or a global climate agreement, if you want to call it that. We will not be able to achieve this in Durban, but we need to establish further milestones on the road to a global climate agreement. This is primarily about meeting the promises and the undertakings which were made last year in Cancún. I will only mention the mechanism for technology transfer from rich northern countries to poorer southern ones and the institutions which will put in place the necessary measures to allow us to adapt to climate change. However, there are other open issues which we can hopefully resolve in Durban. One of these concerns closing the gigatonne gap. In Cancún, everyone agreed that we want to limit the global temperature increase to 2 degrees Celsius, but the commitments that are already on the table are not sufficient. We will end up with an increase of 3.5 or 4 degrees Celsius, which is much too much, as we all know. Therefore, we need to understand how the gigatonne gap can be closed on the basis of common but differing responsibilities for stabilising the earth’s atmosphere. We in Parliament are of the opinion that greenhouse gas emissions will peak in 2015 and this is a very ambitious goal. However, the scientists are telling us that we have to reach this point during this decade. We know that by 2050, we must reduce our greenhouse gas emissions by around 50%, which is a huge task. In Durban, the focus is likely to be on the Kyoto Protocol. We must prevent a gap from occurring between the first commitment period and a further second commitment period. Therefore, we need a solution for the period after 2012 and Parliament is calling on the EU to give its clear support to a second commitment period. We know that we do not have many partners, but they include Switzerland and Norway, together with Australia and New Zealand. I believe that with effective climate change diplomacy, we can achieve a critical mass which will make it worthwhile to implement Kyoto II and, at the same time and most importantly, to force the emerging countries and also the USA to commit to a timetable involving everyone. The idea is that we will succeed in implementing an overarching climate agreement in 2015. I would like to mention an issue that we are all aware of: the funding for combating global climate change. We hope that we can establish a Green Climate Fund in Durban, but we need to know who will manage it, who can become a member, how it will work and where the funding will come from. Parliament has made a number of suggestions including the income from emissions trading, taxes on aviation and shipping and the financial transaction tax, if it is imposed. I shall be brief. We must not use the economic crisis as an excuse for doing nothing. The message that comes out of Durban must make it clear that we cannot allow climate change to overcome the human race. Instead, the human race must have the determination to overcome climate change. That is the message that the European Parliament is taking to South Africa. Jo Leinen,  
Chair of the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Food Safety

 Mr President, President-in-Office of the Council, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Food Safety here in the European Parliament, in the ‘citizens’ chamber’ of the European Union, is tabling a motion for a resolution in order to raise awareness of the threat to public health caused by the resistance of bacteria to antibiotics and to call on the Commission and the Member States to establish an action programme to combat this threat to public health. I am the Chair of the committee, not the author of this resolution, and you can see that we had sponsors from all political parties. We are in agreement in the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Food Safety that we have a ticking time bomb here, a major problem for the health of our citizens, and that there is an urgent need for action. We need an action plan, because the health authorities in Europe are alarmed. During visits this year to the European Medicines Agency (EMA) in London and also to the European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control (ECDC) in Stockholm, our attention was once again drawn by these specialist agencies of the European Union to this problem in particular. In the EU, around 25 000 people a year are now dying of infections caused by resistant bacteria. If we look at the situation, up to the end of the 1970s there was a great deal of activity in the pharmaceuticals industry aimed at developing new molecules and new agents. Since the end of the 1970s, the activity has diminished and come to a standstill. So, if you like, we stopped focusing on this problem 40 years ago. We are simply lacking new agents to fight this resistance. Commissioner Dalli, at this point the first demand that I am going to make is directed at you as the Commissioner responsible, and it is a call on the Commission to draw up a road map with the industry concerned in order to show more commitment to the search for and development of new molecules and new agents. Together with the actors involved in research and industry, you should draw up this road map so that we can obtain a new protection mechanism. We have mentioned a second issue, with regard to which we would ask you – as well as the Member States – to be actively engaged. Antibiotics help to reduce diseases, but if they are not used properly they can also cause damage. We have discovered that antibiotics are used entirely differently in the 27 Member States of the European Union. The Eurobarometer survey has shown how much ignorance there is. Of the people questioned, 53% believe that antibiotics kill viruses and 43% believe that antibiotics are effective against colds and flu. We can imagine how great the misuse of these substances must be, which then contributes to the resistance and puts other people at risk. We are therefore calling on the Commission to define general principles and best practices for the prudent use of antibiotics for 500 million people, for all 27 Member States, and also to ensure that these guidelines are actually implemented and put into practice everywhere in the European Union. We need a major awareness campaign in this area. We believe that we also need a well-functioning monitoring and surveillance system in this sector. The ECDC in Stockholm is our sectoral authority. We need good data, sound surveys and, of course, also analyses of trends and early warnings of the spread of such resistance. Ladies and gentlemen, there is one final issue that we have addressed in a serious way: the cross-transmission of resistance from animals to humans. Antibiotics are used in veterinary medicine as well as human medicine. There are strong indications that crossovers exist. That means that we need cooperation with veterinary medicine in this regard, above all in order to reduce and prohibit the prophylactic use of antibiotics in intensive livestock farming. In this regard, Commissioner, I hope that our resolution will also serve as a mandate for you as well as for the Polish Presidency to take action so that we can protect our citizens against this new threat to health. (Applause) Jo Leinen  (S&amp;D

– Mr President, I want to make a clarification on paragraph 8 because the formulation is misleading. It reads now in the old text ‘is concerned about the focus given to the green economy as one of the two main themes of the Rio Summit’ – ‘is concerned’ seems to be negative, so it should be ‘concerning the focus given to the green economy as one of the two main themes of the Rio Summit’. This is my oral amendment, not ‘is concerned’, but ‘concerning’. This is not negative, we want the green economy. That is the explanation to the Greens who asked me whether this is positive or negative – it is positive. Jo Leinen  (S&amp;D

 Mr President, Mr Barroso, you have called for a renaissance of the European idea. I believe that we agree that the European idea is good, but it requires a new foundation and a new profile to explain why we need Europe and also more Europe in the 21st century. As the Chair of the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Food Safety, one thing is clear to me. Europe must become a stability union from an environmental perspective and not just from a financial perspective. Young people understand above all that with 9 billion of us living on the planet by the middle part of the century, we will be fighting for energy, raw materials and food. Therefore, let us establish a European pact for environmental stability which includes energy efficiency, the efficient use of resources and sustainability. We have started to do this and it must not be allowed to get lost or be given a lower priority during the crisis. These problems will not go away. They will remain and they may even become more pronounced. Please encourage the whole of the Commission to make progress with the environmental profile of the EU. We will have the young people of Europe behind us. Jo Leinen,

 Mr President, President-in-Office of the Council, Professor Kraszewski, Ms Hedegaard, Mr Potočnik, ladies and gentlemen, the European Parliament very much welcomes the fact that the United Nations is holding the Rio+20 conference. We are submitting a resolution to the European Parliament which has been sponsored by Members from a number of different political groups, in other words, it has broad support in this House, and which states that this Earth summit next year in Brazil must be a success. If we look back 20 years to the first Rio conference in 1992, there was a huge amount of commitment and hope that we would be able to reverse the trend in our economic activities on this planet. When we consider what has happened over the last 20 years, there has certainly been a lot of commitment. Some things have been achieved, but the trends and the megatrends are still going in the wrong direction. If we look at the economy, and we discussed it at length this morning, we can see that a financial economy has developed alongside the real economy, which is far more powerful than the traditional economy. The speculation in the financial economy is threatening the real economy and also jeopardising whole countries and regions and many, many people. If we look at developments in the social sector over the last 20 years, there is incredible wealth and unfortunately also incredible poverty. The divide between rich and poor is getting wider. If we move on to the environment, it is clear that our environmental footprint on this planet is still a negative one. Over the last 20 years we have cleared huge areas of forest. We have overfished the seas. We have used up energy resources which took millions of years to form. We have damaged the soil. These are warning signs for the 21st century which indicate to us that we cannot go on like this. There must be a change of direction. We really need to make a renewed attempt to introduce sustainable development. We need a new departure next year in Rio. We need a new political will and a new sense of commitment. We also need an agenda with concrete proposals. It is clear that the three pillars – the economy, the environment and social development – must be better integrated. Economic activities are a good thing, but the economy must serve people and the environment. An economy which destroys people and the environment is not a good economy. We must redefine our economic activities in this broader context. Parliament has made a number of proposals about what is needed: the creation of the right basic conditions, regulation, but also marketable instruments, which will help the economies in our countries to bring in private capital, and the management of natural capital in order to prevent it from being overused and to intervene when ecosystems are exploited. The balance sheet for our activities is the gross domestic product or GDP. We know that GDP is no longer adequate, because it does not tell the whole truth about our activities from an environmental and social perspective. This is why we believe that the leitmotif for the next few years, for the next decade, must be a sustainable economy, a low-carbon, resource-efficient economy. We know that people all over the world do not have fair access to resources. We see large estates being bought up and in many countries, including in Africa, there is the risk that people will no longer be able to cultivate their own food as a result of land theft. This is a phenomenon which we need to devote our attention to. It is clear that many people do not have access to energy. Around 2 billion people have no proper, regular energy supply, which is a huge disadvantage in terms of development. Access to water is by no means evenly distributed all over the world. I only want to mention these three issues. However, there are other obstacles which prevent people from accessing resources easily because they are poor, underprivileged or have other problems. To make sustainable development possible, we need to shift the burden of taxes paid by the citizens of our countries. Currently the major part of the tax burden relates to the work which is done and it is clear that this tax burden must be reduced and shifted from work to the consumption of natural resources and energy. This is an important subject for which we also need the support of the finance ministers and ministers of economic affairs in the Member States. I would like to say in conclusion that sustainability requires commitment from the local level through to the global level. Civil society is a very important resource. People must take part and we must involve them. The state has a job to do, but the private sector also has responsibilities. We must ensure that the private sector does more to make use of its knowledge and expertise in the service of sustainability. At a global level, we simply need better governance, a better structure, in order to organise these environmental and sustainable trends. In Rio we will be discussing whether the United Nations environment programme (UNEP) is adequate in its current form. The answer is clear: it is not. We need better structures at a global level. We in Parliament are hoping that the EU will speak with one voice. We will have a delegation in Durban and we will help to ensure that Europe sets itself a genuine target and plays a pioneering role. We need an agenda 2020 for sustainable development on this planet. Jo Leinen,

Madam President, Commissioner, we, too, welcome your communication on improving civil protection in the European Union. Citizens in Europe expect us to respond quickly and efficiently in the event of a disaster and, above all, to help each other. In the past, we have sometimes sat helpless in front of the television watching forest fires in southern Europe and asked ourselves: why are the others not helping? Your communication now represents the next step towards European solidarity and the efficient use of the capacities that we have in Europe. We have everything that we need. We really do have all of the facilities we need to deal with disasters in Europe. In that respect, this is a positive step forward. As a previous speaker said, national capacities should not be replaced by centralisation at EU level, but we do need to exploit synergies. We really do need everyone to act swiftly together. This is also urgently needed now. I also agree that we need to think more and more in terms of prevention. We need to deal in the right way with the information that we have and must not wait until a disaster has occurred. We can do a great deal with regard to flooding or potential droughts, where fires frequently break out. I am pleased that we will now organise civil protection, both in the EU and also outside the EU, in a coherent way. I agree with Mr Seeber: the areas of responsibility ought to be clear. You are responsible. You ought to accept that responsibility and not permit the areas of responsibility to be mixed up so that we no longer know who is responsible. Finally, I believe that this 24/7 preparedness must always be ensured, including at Christmas, during New Year, on public holidays, and during the summer, too. That is very important. I would like to thank Ms Gardini for her excellent report. Jo Leinen  (S&amp;D

 Madam President, Mr Søndergaard, if we have a list of 25 candidates, these candidates will clearly not all come from a single country, but from 25 countries. Each party will arrange it that way. Would you agree, therefore, that it will actually be the small countries that have the relative advantage and not the large ones? It is precisely the opposite of what you are arguing. Jo Leinen  (S&amp;D

 Madam President, 30 years after the first direct election to the European Parliament, we need a fundamental reform of the electoral system. The shortcomings of the European elections are clear. We must not stagnate, we must not stand still; instead, we must take the next step forward. The next step is indeed this strategic instrument of European lists alongside the national lists. Democracy involves discourse and deliberation, as Professor Habermas used to say. That is exactly our problem. The political class has a national system of discourse. The debates remain in the national realm. We have no overarching European debate, no European political realm, and the European lists would force the political class to come together and to think in European terms, to argue from a European point of view and also to make the alternatives clear to citizens with regard to the forms of Europe they have to choose from in the elections. I hope that we will succeed in implementing these European lists with your report, Mr Duff. We need this vision, and we should not give in. Parliament has already taken a decision in this regard once before, and we cannot be less ambitious than our predecessors. Jo Leinen  (S&amp;D

 Mr President, Mr Dalli, ladies and gentlemen, Europe’s response to genetically modified (GM) crops is different from that of North and South America. We know that GM crops are widely grown not only in the USA and Canada, but also in Argentina and Brazil. However, Eurobarometer surveys show that the opinions of the large majority of the people of Europe on this subject range from scepticism to opposition. For this reason, it would be wrong for Brussels to force the Member States to accept GM crops. It would not be the right thing to do and it would not be accepted. I believe that Parliament and the Commission are moving towards transferring the responsibility and the competence for this area to the Member States. Each country must decide for itself whether or not it wants to introduce genetically modified plants into the environment. It is rather regrettable that we do not have unity within Europe, but that is the reality of the situation. I think that this approach is the right one because the countries which do not want genetically modified organisms (GMOs) should not be forced to use them. Now we need legal certainty concerning the grounds on which GMOs can be opposed. The Commission has referred to some of the reasons, but these are not enough. A number of gaps remain. Mrs Lepage’s report fills precisely these gaps in the environmental aspects. We have totally different ecosystems and different approaches to the environment. This report is definitely a step in the right direction and I hope it is successful. We will be supporting it in any case. What we also need is freedom of choice for farmers and for consumers. Mr Dalli, we urgently need a regulation concerning the distance between GMO fields and conventional crops. First of all, though, Mrs Lepage’s report must achieve a majority in plenary tomorrow. Jo Leinen  (S&amp;D

 Mr President, I would like to inform the House that voting in favour of the first part of the next amendment would mean voting against the energy and climate package of 2008. We have a lot of studies from the Commission showing that fulfilling the climate package means a 25 % reduction, so I would like to ask the House to vote against this amendment. Jo Leinen  (S&amp;D

 – (DE)
 Madam President, Mr Oettinger, ladies and gentlemen, the Group of the Progressive Alliance of Socialists and Democrats in the European Parliament supports Mr Eickhout’s report because it sends out a strong message both internally and externally that we are not giving up on combating climate change. It is an internal signal that we are taking seriously the promise made in the 2008 climate package of 20% renewable energy and 20% energy savings. Mr Oettinger, you have presented us with a proposal today and we have a great deal of work ahead of us. Both of these measures together will result in a 25% reduction in CO2
 emissions within the EU. Who could be opposed to this? It is not possible, because it is a package of legislation which we have adopted. In addition, we have a responsibility to the rest of the world. We also have to achieve a level of 5% clean development mechanisms (CDMs). That makes a total of 30%. I hope that this will not be watered down. The amendment to paragraph 3 would destroy the entire report. If this amendment is passed, we will be voting against the report tomorrow. I hope that this will not be the case, because we need to send out a strong signal. Jo Leinen  (S&amp;D

 Madam President, on a point of order, we are holding a debate now with the Commissioner, not a debate amongst ourselves and amongst the political groups. I think, under the Rules, we have one blue card and not six or seven. Jo Leinen  (S&amp;D

 – (DE) 
Madam President, Mr Oettinger, the stress tests are necessary and also long overdue. It is surprising that they have not been carried out before. You should take the credit for the fact that all the nuclear power stations in the EU are finally going to be inspected. However, we must admit that we are skating on very thin ice with these stress tests. You have rightly said that several countries were not prepared to take part in a European inspection procedure. Of course, there is the risk that the inspection will differ from country to country. Some will not want to include aircraft crashes and others will only open up a part of their plants for stress tests. You need to make sure that the tests are genuinely comprehensive. It is also clear that you have not made a comprehensive evaluation. The area of human failure is incomplete. The risk now and in future is not that an aircraft will accidentally crash on a nuclear power plant, but that there will be targeted attacks on these plants from outside. That is precisely what is not being tested. I live on the border with France and Luxembourg and there are four nuclear power stations in Cattenom. We have been told that the fire service and the police are responsible for them. I imagine that al-Qaeda and other terrorists will almost die laughing when they find out that the fire service and the police are responsible for preventing the threat of terrorism. This really must be included in the stress test. Finally, what will the consequences be if you find errors and weak points? There is the risk that we will not be able to do anything at a European level and that it will all come to nothing. Will some of the power plants really be shut down or modernised? It is high time that the Euratom Treaty was revised. This situation, where we have no influence over the safety of nuclear power stations, cannot continue. Jo Leinen  (S&amp;D

 Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, farmers can be compensated, but human life cannot be recovered. Indeed, our sympathy goes out to all those who have died or are lying in a hospital bed. This situation is dramatic and it is also unacceptable. It is unacceptable that three weeks after the outbreak of this crisis, we still do not know exactly where the pathogen that caused the crisis originated. That really should not happen in Europe. There are several lessons we need to learn from this. Firstly, we need to look for the source and examine whether improper practices are still present in the food production sector or in the food supply chain. We have legislation that has been in place for 20 years, and the standards and codes of practices in the European Union are quite stringent, but it is clear that we are still vulnerable when it comes to foodstuffs. There still seem to be gaps and shortcomings and we need to learn from this once again. I also think that the communication on this matter has been chaotic. Facts about this matter are not communicated well or in the right way. We clearly need more Europe. That has already been said by other Members here. When any regional or national authority issues a warning for the whole of Europe, it can only be a disaster. In my view, the European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control (ECDC) has done a good job, as far as I can see, but we need a better, modern reporting obligation for determining the causes and also a better system for informing the general public. Jo Leinen,  
rapporteur.

 Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, today we are debating, and tomorrow we will adopt, European legislation that, on first impression, seems rather unremarkable, but with this law on European environmental economic accounts, we are probably opening a new chapter in the measurement of progress and prosperity. We have known for a long time that gross national product is inadequate. The purely quantitative view of economic activity says nothing about the environmental balance sheet, nor about the social balance sheet, and therefore it is high time that we measured whether, year on year, we are doing well or badly in terms of our measures and efforts. We have monthly statistics relating to our labour market figures and we have annual statistics relating to our economic figures. We therefore know exactly what is happening in these areas. However, we have an incomplete patchwork of data on the environmental impact. This law on environmental economic accounts is intended to help us to draw up an accurate balance sheet in the 27 Member States and to establish whether we are making progress or, as is often the case, whether we are going backwards. As long ago as 2002, Parliament called for reliable information to be collected on the state of the environment and the most important trends in, influences on, and causes of, environmental change, and for the public to be informed of these things. We want a scientifically sound concept for measuring the consumption of resources to enable appropriate political decisions to be taken. We are pleased that the Commission took this legislative initiative in April 2010, but in our opinion, it was much too tentative in the way it went about it. We in Parliament and all of the groups have called for this to be done much more quickly, because the Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD) and the United Nations have already been discussing these matters for 15 years. This is taking far too long. We have therefore made considerable progress in the negotiations with the Council. It was a very difficult situation in the Council, because some Member States do not produce an environmental balance sheet and we first need to create a foundation in all 27 Member States. The Commission proposed the inclusion of three modules. These modules are air emissions – in this regard, we are very well aware of which gases are emitted into the air. Then there is the financial expenditure arising from environmental taxes and environmental charges. Thirdly, there are the year-on-year national material flows, the input and output, measured in purely quantitative terms. This is a start, perhaps, but it is too simple a start, and Parliament has called for us also to produce water, energy and waste balance sheets and to find out about the status of our forests. These are the modules that we urgently want to see in the very near future. There was disagreement about whether statistics can also be produced for the marine environment, in other words, statistics on the status of fish stocks. In this regard, our methodology is probably still in need of improvement. Thus, we have achieved improvements in this area. In two years’ time – by 2013 at the latest – the Commission is to present a report and, where possible, also propose a revision of this directive. I hope that, at the end of this decade, we will have a green national product in addition to the gross national product. That is our goal. Jo Leinen,  
rapporteur.

 Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, thank you for the debate. I see broad support for the creation of environmental balance sheets in the European Union. With a few exceptions, this has found favour here. I also agree with Mrs Kadenbach’s statement. Many of us thought that this was already in place, and we were surprised to find that a lot of data does not exist at all, and that in the statements we make with regard to the state of the environment in the European Union, we are therefore actually completely blind. One Member, Mr Gerbrandy, said that measurement brings knowledge. We then know something, and knowledge is the basis for taking measures and for all of our programmes. We quite simply need a better basis for the decisions that we take. These environmental accounts can help us in this regard. Of course, we have the EU 2020 strategy, in which sustainability is a planning goal. I hope that in the next few years, we will also have this basis so that in 2020, we will be able to see whether we were successful or not. We know that gross domestic product provides no information on the state of the natural world and the environment, on resources that we have used, or on the whole sustainability problem. That is why this is now necessary. We are also tackling this in stages. Mrs Klaß, we are not making excessive demands; rather, the modules are to be expanded gradually. After all, as the Commissioner said, the individual pieces of legislation – the water legislation, waste legislation and clean air legislation – already contain the requirement to collect this data. Europe is also under a global obligation, Mr Nuttall. If we sign the Convention on Biological Diversity, the Convention on Climate Change or any other convention, we must be able to tell the rest of the world whether we have done well or badly. Thus, all in all, I would like to thank the shadow rapporteurs and also Eurostat, which will subsequently have to carry out the work. I hope that the necessary resources will be available in Luxembourg, because without funds, without resources, this balance sheet cannot, of course, be produced. Parliament should also help out in this regard. Thank you very much. This is an important political matter – as some people have rightly recognised – and it is a new chapter in the consideration of what we do in Europe year in year out. Jo Leinen,

 Madam President, Mrs Győri, Mr Dalli, ladies and gentlemen, I have been involved in many negotiation processes here in Parliament, but the 12 hours of this conciliation procedure, which lasted from 19:00 to 07:00 the next morning, will remain in my memory for a long time. This was a very special event. Unfortunately, the two sides came from different planets. Parliament’s approach was clear, which was to focus on the interests of consumers and of the citizens of the EU. Others were considering the interests of the meat and agriculture industries. Because of these divergent approaches, we were not able to reach an agreement. This is a pity, because we now have a gap in the EU food legislation which we need to close very quickly. We were all relatively clear about this, including Mr Pittella, who acted as chair, and the rapporteur. The entire team was pulling together. Now we need to take the next step. We must fill this gap. Mr Dalli, you must present two proposals: one on novel foods, because we have almost reached a consensus on this with regard to nanomaterials, the centralised approval process and imports from third countries. The other proposal concerns cloning. You have listened to everything that we have to say on this subject. We do not want these products on the European market. At the very least, we want them to be labelled, because consumers should have freedom of choice. That is your job and Parliament is ready to support you. I hope you will be able to submit a proposal very soon. Jo Leinen,  
on behalf of the S&amp;D Group

 Mr President, Mr Oettinger, ladies and gentlemen, I would like to thank Mr Sonik for triggering this debate and for preparing the oral question. I agree that we should never forget the Chernobyl disaster. We are well aware that the long-term consequences of the catastrophe are still being experienced a full quarter century later. There is still a large uninhabitable area, so that people can no longer return to their homes. Then there is the long-term impact on health. Television has shown us that women still suffer miscarriages 25 years after the disaster. Europe shares some of the responsibility because the issue of nuclear safety is not a matter of national sovereignty, but rather one of European responsibility. On this densely populated continent, every nuclear power plant has consequences for neighbouring countries. It is for this reason, Mr Oettinger, that you have particular responsibility for ensuring that we get to grips with this topic, especially in the light of what has happened in Fukushima. Later on we are going to talk with you about the stress tests, in other words the safety analyses for the 143 nuclear power plants. I would encourage you to stick to your principles. We want the highest possible safety standard in Europe, not just investigations into natural disasters. Accordingly we must also investigate other risks, such as plane crashes, terrorist attacks, computer attacks, in other words this combination of attacks on nuclear power plants; what is more, you must guarantee that this does not become simply a token gesture. There is still a great deal to be done in Chernobyl. The sarcophagus is not yet safe, which is why new financial resources are required to put this in order. I have not yet heard any plans for what to do with the nuclear waste lying about the site; the disposal of this material is not yet assured. Accordingly I believe, Mr Reul, that research studies are necessary because we do not have enough experience with the long-term effects of radiation. I would encourage the Commission to put such studies in motion. In the final analysis, the safest option is the nuclear exit strategy. As we continue to cooperate with the affected countries, my greatest wish is that we should establish workshops for future technology there, and provide advice on how to save energy and develop alternative energy sources. This is precisely what is needed 25 years after Chernobyl. (The speaker agrees to take a question in accordance with Rule 149(8) of the Rules of Procedure.) Jo Leinen  (S&amp;D
). 
 – (DE)
 Mr President, I would like to thank Mr Rübig for his question. The aim must be to establish a European competence for monitoring nuclear power stations. If an issue has an impact that goes beyond national borders, then this involves a European dimension, which also requires a European competence. Mr Oettinger, we do not yet have this competence, however you must do all you can to ensure that we are given the basis to monitor nuclear plants independently and objectively from a European perspective, enabling us to draw our own conclusions when weaknesses are pinpointed. If the stress test shows that a power plant is unsafe, then it must be shut down or, if possible, upgraded. Jo Leinen  (S&amp;D
). 
 – (DE)
 Mr President, you have heard what the Chair of the Committee on Industry, Research and Energy has said. Now I am speaking as Chair of the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Food Safety and the differences could not be greater. The fact that we need the highest safety levels for all nuclear power plants goes without saying. We all agree on that. Mr Oettinger, your stress test is an important first step, but it does not go nearly far enough. I also believe that we need to rethink our approach and come up with a new one which goes into greater depth and is far more fundamental. This is why, in addition to the highest safety standards in the EU, we also need an exit scenario from a risky technology, which we cannot justify using on the densely populated continent of Europe. Mr Reul, you and others will simply have to go along with this. Your colleagues in Berlin have made much more progress than you have here in Strasbourg and in Brussels. They have probably reached the turning point, while you are still stuck with your old ideas. I hope that we can come up with a formulation, a scenario and a strategy for exiting from nuclear power. Mr Oettinger, the road map which you are producing in June of this year would be a wonderful opportunity to achieve this. After the stress tests, you must also give us your idea of how we can get out of nuclear technology. (Applause) Jo Leinen  (S&amp;D

 Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, the Treaty of Lisbon, on which work went on for so long, had two clear messages: firstly, the strengthening of the Community method with a central role for the Commission and, secondly, the strengthening of democracy with the participation of the European Parliament. Little more than a year after the entry into force of the Treaty, the spirit of Lisbon is already being ignored and ridden roughshod over. What the European Council has devised with this revision of the Treaty is unequivocally contrary to both of these messages of the Treaty of Lisbon. The Community method is not being strengthened – instead, what we have is renationalisation, intergovernmentalisation, in an important area of future EU policy and the complete exclusion of the bodies of the EU. That is unacceptable and Parliament actually has to be opposed to this proposal. It amazes me that the Commission, as guardian of the Treaties, has not spoken up more clearly and that we here in Parliament have to act, to some extent, as representatives of the Commission. We must push the Commission into action that it should already have taken. A dangerous precedent is being set here. We are observing as a result of the economic crisis that monetary union cannot exist alone. Given the influx of refugees from North Africa and the uncertainty in our neighbourhood, we are seeking additional EU policies and we do not want renationalisation. I hope that the rapporteurs can still make improvements as otherwise, I cannot vote in favour of this revision of the Treaty. Jo Leinen  (S&amp;D
).

 Mr President, the first energy summit in the history of the European Union will take place on Friday, because, with the entry into force of the Treaty of Lisbon, the Union has direct responsibilities in this sector for the first time. I agree with Mr Barroso that energy policy may be the European Union’s next big integration project. There are very many aspects to this, and President Buzek has always said that we need an energy community in the EU. Where this summit was concerned, there were many hopes and expectations that the European Union’s strategic questions with regard to energy supply would be answered. What are the strategic questions? Yes, Mr Saryusz-Wolski, they include the EU’s dependence on energy imports. They include the enormous amount of energy that is still being wasted, and there are also the negative consequences of the current energy system on ecosystems and in particular on the Earth’s atmosphere. When I look at the Council conclusions, I have to say that this energy summit is going to be a huge disappointment, because it will not answer any of these major questions. It has actually been poorly prepared in terms of the common vision that we need and it has also been poorly prepared in terms of the coherence of the resources and instruments that we use. I would like mention once again that yesterday, at the alternative energy summit of the Group of the Progressive Alliance of Socialists and Democrats in the European Parliament, a five pillar concept was proposed for how we can answer these strategic questions, how we can reduce energy imports and energy wastage and, of course, how we can eliminate the negative impact on the environment. The proposed means for achieving this were through the development of renewable energies, through energy efficiency and through the use of information technology to interlink these different energy sources. That is an innovation summit. I have not heard of information technology being used as a strategic factor before. I therefore believe that we need a technological revolution, and this summit ought to be setting us on the right course. However, I have the impression that it is going in the wrong direction. Jo Leinen  (S&amp;D

Madam President, I am pleased to be able to speak after my successor on the Committee on Constitutional Affairs, because I supported this project for 10 years and the European citizens’ initiative was included in the text of the treaty almost at the last second. Back then, it was the Members of this Parliament and of the national parliaments who took the initiative in the Convention. This opens a new chapter in the relationships between the citizens and the European institutions. All of us hope that this will reduce the distance between people and politics in Europe. The citizens’ initiative is not the cure for all our ills, but it can be a huge help. Above all, I would like to see more openness in Europe, in the form of a cross-border debate on current issues which are of interest to citizens. In my area, the environment, I can think of a number of subjects which could be put on the European Union’s agenda using this instrument and, in particular, on the agenda of the Commission in its role as European government or executive. I would also like to ask the Commission how it is preparing for these future initiatives. We must not disappoint the people. I would like to thank everyone and especially the rapporteurs Mrs Gurmai and Mr Lamassoure for their excellent work. Jo Leinen,

 Mr President, we would like to thank the Commission and the Council, Mrs Hedegaard and Mrs Schauvliege, for the daily briefings that the European Parliament delegation received in Cancún. We can truly say that, in Cancún, the EU was not part of the problem but, in many cases, was part of the solution. That should please all of us. The positive mood must now be utilised to bring new momentum to climate policy in Europe and also to the European Union. I would just like to mention three points. It was absolutely right for Parliament, in its resolution, to call for us to raise our ambitions and achieve a reduction in CO2
 of 30% by 2020, and I hope that the Commission and the Council will adopt decisions on this in the spring. Secondly, we have the Green Climate Fund. We proposed the introduction of a financial transaction tax to finance this. The people who rejected this must now come up with alternatives – we can no longer beat about the bush. Thirdly, we must do our homework. We must take the hot air out of the EU’s carbon footprint. My final point is this: This climate conference is done. Now let us look to the next one. The work must now be stepped up. Jo Leinen  (S&amp;D
). 
 – (DE) 
Mr President, Mrs Schauvliege, Commissioner, I am concerned that we are going from one extreme to the other. Prior to Copenhagen we were perhaps too ambitious, and now, ahead of Cancún, I am concerned that we are not being ambitious enough. I therefore think it is good that, in its resolution, Parliament addresses all the issues that we believe to be necessary for there to be progress and for us to achieve results even in Cancún. We have one major demand, and that is that the EU switch its strategy. Prior to Copenhagen, we made ourselves dependent on what was done in the United States and perhaps on what was done in China. That did not work there and it will not work in Cancún either. We should therefore take climate protection measures to protect our own interests. Hence the call by the majority in committee, and I hope in plenary tomorrow too, for us to increase our targets from 20% to 30%. That will be necessary during the course of the process in any case. We need to achieve this target at least before we go to South Africa. I also think that we are still on the wrong track with regard to Kyoto. Here too, we are relying on everyone else. I believe that our offer should be to establish Kyoto II. We will have no problem doing this; we will achieve it. Finally, with regard to the EU speaking with one voice: I saw how this worked in Nagoya. We had one microphone for the EU. Different people could speak, but they had to convey the same message. That is what I would like to see from the Council and the Commission in Cancún, too. Jo Leinen,  
on behalf of the S&amp;D Group.
 – (DE) 
Madam President, I hope that our Commissioner gets his voice back again, because we need a voice at the climate conference in Cancún. I had been rather surprised that Mrs Damanaki was speaking here on the revision of the hazardous substances directive after also speaking on the fisheries revisions; thank you for stepping into the breach. Parliament has not got everything that it wanted. Annex 3 has been dropped, which we regret. However, we will continue to keep an eye on these substances and when the revision takes place in three years’ time, you will have to come back to this House with your impact assessments and provide evidence of the problems that exist there on a substance-by-substance basis. We also have a considerable number of exemptions, so that it rather resembles a Swiss cheese. We also need to check here the gaps and shortcomings that exist as regards human health and the environment. I will simply say that solar panels were highly controversial. We want to keep cadmium out of the environment, but these panels put 100 000 tonnes of cadmium into the environment. That is something we will have to watch carefully. I am pleased that the Commission has made some concessions with its four statements, so for now, we will take what progress has been made in 2010 and we will meet again in three years’ time for the revision. Naturally, I would also like to thank the rapporteurs and shadow rapporteurs. Jo Leinen,

 Madam President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, the Gulf of Mexico has probably suffered one of the biggest environmental disasters of recent years, and we in Europe – in the European Union – must do everything we can to ensure that such a disaster cannot happen here. I believe we are in agreement on that. We have four seas adjoining the EU or situated within the EU: the North Sea, the Baltic Sea, the Mediterranean and the Black Sea. Oil drilling takes place in these European waters. In this regard, the subject is also an issue for the European Union. Deep-sea drilling especially represents a particular risk. That has become evident from the oil well in the Gulf of Mexico. There are problems here that are beyond our control. A great many outstanding questions have arisen to which we still do not have answers. Ladies and gentlemen, Commissioner, that is why we are recommending to you in our resolution that it would be appropriate to have a moratorium at least on new applications for deep-sea drilling until such time as we have a complete overview of what is needed and how we can close the gaps and remedy the shortcomings. I believe that the citizens of Europe expect us to ensure an equally high level of security for all 27 Member States, and thus for all four seas of the EU, and that there is no gap between countries that are already doing a lot – and that should be recognised – and those that are perhaps somewhat more lax in this area. I am also addressing our neighbouring countries here. We have a Neighbourhood Policy, and in the Mediterranean, in particular, there are, of course, also drillings by countries that are not members of the European Union. Commissioner Oettinger, I believe you are taking initiatives – and that is something you must indeed do – to talk to Libya in particular, but also to others, concerning our standards and our approaches. The question is: would the EU be prepared for such a disaster? What control mechanisms and intervention mechanisms do we have in the event of such a disaster? We need answers to this too. We have the agency in Lisbon, the European Maritime Safety Agency (EMSA), which was established in the aftermath of a disaster involving the break-up of supertankers. The agency thus checks the safety of vessels, but not the safety of the seas – in other words, precisely what we have now seen in respect of deep-sea drilling. In our opinion, it would be a good idea to expand EMSA’s mandate to allow these things also to come within its remit. That would at least address the problem adequately. I imagine that new resources would be needed for this. That is always a problem, of course. However, if we want to deal with such a major issue, then the resources will have to be found. I would also like to mention liability for such major events. What, in fact, is the insurance situation? What possibilities are there for getting the funds needed? We need to gain an overview of liability and insurance law relating to deep-sea drilling, and that is something we are discussing. Naturally we also, and above all, need to see how this applies to small companies operating in this field. Not all the companies active in this area are multinationals; there are many small companies too. How will they manage? How can they insure themselves? Do we need solidarity funds? Do we need collective solutions to ensure that those who suffer are compensated – the fishermen and others who are affected by such disasters? We also want to know whether the Environmental Impact Assessment Directive, which demands environmental impact assessments for activities on land, also applies to deep-sea drilling and related areas. There is much we do not know about the high seas. What kind of working conditions and social standards are effective there? After all, the human factor can also play a major role. We have good technology, but if the human factor fails, then it could result in such disasters. Commissioner, you have overall responsibility for energy. Offshore oil has its problems; offshore wind would be better. I believe that this debate naturally opens the way for a different energy policy in the EU – and that also lies within your remit.

 Mr President, Mr Tajani, ladies and gentlemen, along with industrial chemicals and agricultural chemicals, household chemicals represent the third large group of substances which are of significance for the environment and human health, and we are introducing rules covering these products in the biocide regulation. I believe that we have made significant progress since the old directive which dates back to 1998. Other speakers have already mentioned this. We are introducing a comprehensive regulation which applies not only to products manufactured in the EU, but also to imported products. This is very important. We are improving the labelling of these substances and, as Mr Jørgensen has said, we are calling for animal testing of these products to be replaced with alternative methods. We want to see animal tests reduced to a minimum or even abolished altogether in this area. In addition, we want particularly hazardous substances to be replaced with substances which are less dangerous. All of these measures represent progress and we can explain to the citizens of Europe that they will benefit human health and the environment. I was surprised about the level of disagreement as to whether or not the European Chemicals Agency (ECHA) in Helsinki should be responsible for monitoring and authorising these products. We want the same standards to apply throughout Europe and we want it to be possible for these products to be sold on the European market. For this reason, it is right that the ECHA takes responsibility for this area. I would like to ask Mr Tajani whether the ECHA has sufficient funding and the right organisation to be able to take on this task. My thanks go to Mrs Klaß and to the shadow rapporteurs for achieving a consensus on this subject. Jo Leinen,

 Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, I am not going to point the finger at any particular country, but I believe the finger is pointing back at all of us, because the EU strategy for 2010 has not worked and we need to think of new approaches for the new decade leading up to 2020. In a few weeks, the UN Conference of the Parties to the Convention on Biological Diversity will take place in Nagoya, and I hope that it will not be a similar disappointment to the UN Climate Change Conference in Copenhagen. At such an important global nature conservation conference, there simply must not be another failure, and the EU must play a major role in ensuring that is the case. We need to push for an ambitious global programme for the preservation of biodiversity. We must show solidarity in the financing of these measures, and the EU must speak with one voice and not 27 different ones. The Economics of Ecosystems and Biodiversity (TEEB) study has been mentioned. EUR 50 billion is lost each year as a result of species decline. In this case, 0.2% of financial resources from the EU budget for nature conservation is very meagre and paltry. In the medium-term financial programme, we simply must be provided with more money for the conservation of species. As far as the solidarity of the EU with the rest of the world is concerned, we also need an instrument that we can use to provide something in return for the species that we remove, particularly for medicinal plants. Developing countries need compensation. I also believe that the key to success lies in viewing biodiversity as a cross-cutting task. Agriculture, forestry, fisheries, marine exploitation – these now all need to be viewed from a species perspective. A soil protection directive will also gain a new importance. The soil is a buffer for CO2
, and changes to the soil represent a very negative scenario. Parliament will stand up for biodiversity. Congratulations to the rapporteur. Jo Leinen,  
on behalf of the S&amp;D Group.

Madam President, this disaster happened off the coast of the US, not the EU. It therefore affords us a real opportunity to learn some lessons and draw some conclusions. Mr Oettinger said that this is the second time we have discussed this issue. My committee has also held a major debate, and I am thankful to you that as soon as next week, together with the coordinators of the Committee on Industry, Research and Energy and the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Food Safety, we shall learn the results of your analysis, enabling us to continue our work into the summer recess. I would support you on the imposition of a moratorium on extreme drilling in Europe. We need to wait until we have identified the problems. I would also support your call for European standardisation, stringent safety standards and a European supervisory authority. As you have said, what we need is a system for auditing the auditors. I like this idea a lot. We would be happy to work on this. Mrs Damanaki, I liked what I heard from you: this disaster must spur us to change. The integrated maritime policy you have called for is a major project for the EU. I believe that harnessing the renewable energy of the sea, whether through deep-sea currents or other forms of retrieval that are yet to be invented, is a really key issue. I believe that the institutions, including the Council, have demonstrated a determination to prevent such a disaster in Europe, as has Parliament, and will be happy to cooperate with you in avoiding such an eventuality. Jo Leinen  (S&amp;D

 Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, a similar picture seems to be emerging from within all the groups. We had an interesting debate too on this regulation, which was also filled with controversy. However, the large majority of us feel that we will vote tomorrow with the rapporteur and give a clear signal to the Commission and Council. Commissioner, I believe that you said that we have a consensus. With novel foods, we need prior authorisation before they enter the market. I also explicitly agree that we need a central authorisation procedure and not different authorisation procedures in 27 Member States. This would not conform to the concept of the internal market and the uniformity of health and living conditions. We have new technologies entering the food market – as has already been mentioned in this Chamber – such as nanotechnology and GMOs. We are adopting a cautious approach in this House until we know all the facts and can be sure that our citizens can buy food which is totally safe in our supermarkets and then eat it afterwards. We are not calling for a ban on GMOs and nanomaterials. We want consumers to be given the freedom of choice or, in other words, a label indicating if these materials are contained in the food. I hope that during its cross-section debate on nanomaterials next week, the Commission will also reach a definition and perhaps a regulation so that we can have more material available about how we should handle nanomaterials. A great deal has already been said about meat from cloned animals. I would like you, Commissioner, to remove this section from the novel foods regulation. This would pave the way for a regulation on all the other topics which are not controversial. However, I would still call for a decision to be made about a separate regulation for meat from cloned animals before the conciliation procedure has ended, and to remove this from the novel foods regulation.

 Mr President, Commissioner Potočnik has thanked this Parliament emphatically for the fact that we have stayed so hard-headed with this legislative package, and that we have contributed to the big push forward that will now take place on the prevention of air pollution. The thanks for this must, of course, go to our rapporteur, Mr Krahmer, for his excellent work, but also to all the shadow rapporteurs and the others who stayed with us on this objective to make Europe’s air cleaner. The European Environment Agency has given us a report which shows that in some areas, we still have a bad situation as regards air pollution, nitrogen oxides and dust. Commissioner, you said it yourself. Now we hope that, with this new amendment, you will also have a tool for carrying out controls. We hope that you will also really implement this in a hard-headed manner and not accept any major exemptions or time wasting. After all, the previous directive dates from 1996 – that is, 14 years ago! I can understand the new Member States such as Poland and others, but I cannot understand the old Member States at all – the fact that in all these years, so little has been done, and the arguments that we hear again in this instance too, with regard to jobs and costs. Well, of course, these things always turn out badly; if we wait too long, then everything comes at once. If we do our work on time, then we can also carry out innovations and still protect jobs. Thus we have a great success, though it is spoiled somewhat by the large combustion plants. The small fry are arrested, while the big fish are allowed to go free. What happens so often in life is also unfortunately happening here with industrial plants. Jo Leinen,

 Mr President, Mr Kallas, ladies and gentlemen, transport policy is of great importance when it comes to protecting both the environment and people’s health. It is good that the European Union has a strategy covering the period up to 2020 in order to resolve the many problems in current transport systems. We need to see a significant reduction in the environmental impact of road transport. We need genuine innovations in this area to reduce CO2
 emissions and also nitrogen oxides and fine particulates. In addition, we must integrate air and sea transport more closely into our environmental strategy. In particular, in the case of sea transport, sulphur and nitrogen oxide emissions are rising, and improvements are needed in this area. The increase in the noise produced by transport is also a nuisance for millions of people, which impacts on their quality of life. Improvements must be made in road transport, but also in rail and air transport. I would like to mention the internalisation of external costs. Company cars bring tax benefits and the airline industry does not pay excise duty on fuel, which means that we still have a great deal to do in this area. I would like to congratulate Mr Grosch on his excellent report. Jo Leinen,

 Madam President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, our group welcomes the statement by the Commission that we will fight to maintain the moratorium on commercial whaling. Now it is up to the Council to confirm this statement and, above all, to ensure that the 27 Member States speak with one voice. We cannot afford to delay this. We know from the meeting of the environment ministers that we do not have agreement here. There are some individual Member States that are pursuing different interests to the vast majority. Now that we have the Treaty of Lisbon, we ought to get used to the fact that we also speak with one voice in our foreign policy and in the representation of our values and interests in international organisations and not, as was the case in the past, each Member State for itself, which ultimately resulted in the weakening of Europe. We have seen this already at the CITES Conference. Here, our lack of agreement was ultimately a kind of powerlessness. We did not achieve what we wanted. I would not like this to continue in the International Whaling Commission. 2010 is the International Year of Biodiversity; in other words, the protection of ecosystems and threatened animal and plant species will be right at the centre of our efforts during these months. It would be a very bad sign if, in the Whaling Commission of all places, the moratorium was lifted and commercial whaling was permitted once again. We know that this animal species remains vulnerable. Our seas are becoming increasingly polluted and climate change will place yet another new strain on them. We therefore need to be very careful in our approach to this subject. The commercial interests of Japan, Iceland and Norway cannot take precedence here. Protection of this species and its ecosystems must determine our path. We are seeing the abuse of the concept of ‘scientific hunting’. Japan is clearly killing 900 whales a year in the Antarctic Ocean under the concept of ‘scientific whaling’. That is blatant abuse and I fully support the concerns of the Australian Government, which also no longer wants to permit this. We should do what the Commission has proposed in this regard. We call on the Council to create unity here so that we will speak with one voice at the forthcoming meeting of the International Whaling Commission. Jo Leinen,

 Mr President, we do not need to take a detour with regard to this vote. We can decide directly. The Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Food Safety has recommended that plenary bans the sticking together of separate pieces of meat and therefore does not allow thrombin to be used as an additive. A steak must be a steak and a ham must be a ham. I am sure that this is what the constituents of all the Members of this House want. Therefore, please vote in favour of our amendment not to include thrombin as an additive in our food regulation. Jo Leinen  (S&amp;D

 Mr President, the theme of the Lisbon Strategy was competitiveness and it was a very strongly one-sided economic strategy, which, of course, in part has failed. I am therefore very pleased that the theme of the EU 2020 strategy is now sustainability. That is the right way to go and it also involves a better balance between economic, social and environmental developments and needs. The disadvantage of sustainability is that it is a very general concept that can also lack substance. We therefore need to make it more specific. In this regard, the Commission’s paper is much too vague, as there are too many pieces of the picture missing to allow us to implement it. A resource-efficient Europe is the right approach – we have meagre energy reserves and meagre raw material reserves – but there is a lack of targets and instruments to bring us to this point of resource efficiency in our production and in our consumption. In this regard, I hope that by June we will have something rather more tangible and that we will know precisely what each of us has to do – what the Commission will do, what Parliament will do and what the Member States will have to do. In relation to this resource-efficient Europe, the environment seems to have been somewhat forgotten, because air, water, land and also ecosystems are resources too. That has been completely lost. I would therefore like to hear more from the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Food Safety in respect of what we want to do in this regard. The biodiversity strategy has failed. A new one has, of course, been drawn up to take us to 2020 and this point must be taken into account in this strategy. Climate protection has certainly been tossed about many times. I believe that we need to increase our reduction target from 20% to 30% and we need mandatory targets for energy efficiency. This is still too vague – we need to make it legally binding.

 Mr President, as if we had been able to predict what was going to happen, the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Food Safety, which is also responsible for civil protection, has an own-initiative report on the community approach to the prevention of natural disasters in the pipeline. The rapporteur is Mr Ferreira. We will be voting on this report in the next session and we will discuss our experience of the volcanic ash cloud then. Plenary will very soon be able to formulate Parliament’s position on these subjects. I agree with the Members who have said that we are poorly prepared for natural disasters. Fortunately, Europe has few natural disasters. However, we also have little experience in this area and it is clear that our crisis management is poor. In my opinion, it all took too long. Five days before a test flight took place and real data was collected is simply too long. We must learn from this. I do not want to make any accusations, but experience shows that we must do things better the next time around. If this volcanic ash has made one thing clear, it is the need for more Europe. Mr Kallas, you have said that the national authorities have responsibilities. However, this does not help the people who have suffered as a result. We need more Europe in civil protection and in a common transport policy. The Treaty of Lisbon opens up more opportunities for us. In the same way as Mrs Hübner, I would like to ask you how you will make use of the opportunities afforded by the Treaty of Lisbon in crisis management and civil protection. This situation must improve. Jo Leinen,  
rapporteur for the opinion of the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Food Safety.

 Madam President, Commissioner, the European Parliament has been waiting for this moment for a long time, namely for Parliament to be on an equal footing with the Council with respect to the control of legislative delegation. To illustrate this point: in 2008, there were 6 000 delegated acts, in other words, a huge mountain of standards, which were turned into a kind of secondary legislation by the Commission and the old comitology procedure. Parliament had very few rights in this process. We were informed, but we were not colegislators. The Treaty of Lisbon has now changed that. With regard to the control of delegated acts, we are on an equal footing with the Council, and we also want to utilise our equal standing to the full. That means, Commissioner, that when you argue that the urgency procedure is possible, then we will also need to receive information at as early a stage as possible. We want to receive information as early as the Council receives it. Jo Leinen  (S&amp;D

 Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, the Greek crisis is a current problem, while the growth crisis and the environmental crisis are long-term problems, and both need to be tackled dynamically with decisions taken by the European Council. The Europe 2020 strategy rightly states that growth should be intelligent, sustainable and inclusive. When I look at the Council’s conclusions, however, I see that they are much more narrowly focused and reduced to the classical growth strategy – a strategy that has failed and that did not get us very far. Growth cannot be intelligent if it is not sustainable and it is also not intelligent if it is not inclusive. That is why I would like to ask the Council and the Presidency of the Council to ensure that this triad, these three pillars, are retained. This is the new development that really should be implemented now. I am very pleased that growth that saves on resources and on energy is to be a flagship of the European Union. Of course, we have been talking about this for a long time. This will actually help us to save costs, reduce dependencies and solve a series of problems. I expect the Commission to provide us with a roadmap in the course of 2010, as it is a shared responsibility of the EU itself but also of the Member States, and many areas are therefore on very soft ground and very vague. Above all, we must make the target of 20% energy savings binding. This efficiency target must thus be made legally binding so that everyone knows where things are headed and industry can also realise the relevant investment. Jo Leinen  (S&amp;D
).

 A very warm welcome to Parliament, Commissioner. I wrote a letter to the President of Parliament to inform him that all of the delegations in this House have climate protection on the agenda in our discussions with our partners throughout the world. We need to find another mechanism to enable this information and these results to be linked in with your travels around the world so that those of us here in Brussels and Strasbourg know exactly where we stand. I am rather concerned that the climate negotiations could suffer the same fate as the Doha negotiations, which are constantly being postponed year after year. My question is, therefore, what is your plan B in order, perhaps, to achieve results in parts of some sectors? I also have a question concerning the Kyoto Protocol. One strategic error we made in Bangkok was to give the impression that we would abandon it. What would happen if we do not adopt something until 2011 or 2012? What is the future for the Kyoto Protocol? Jo Leinen  (S&amp;D

Mr President, Commissioner, welcome to Parliament. I would like to join my fellow Member, Mr Schnellhardt, by saying you have a major task in this area, to create genuinely equal conditions in the 27 Member States by 2010 so that household pets can be transported and brought from one country to another without obstacles. Free movement for dogs and cats was certainly the goal of the 2003 regulation. Now, for the third time, we are making an exception. In the EU, some things take a really long time: ten years to tune such regulations. No country in the EU wants diseases to be introduced and I also wonder why 22 countries accept the idea of dogs and cats being allowed to travel with their owners and five countries do not. You should examine whether the reality and the obstacles still correspond to these special provisions. I know that there are thorny debates at national level, but we are now one legal space and it is time, by 2011 at the latest, to introduce free movement, the single market for pets. The animal expert, Mr Schnellhardt, has already mentioned the conditions, namely that there is a vaccination card and that instruments like electronic tagging will be used, which will then give you access to the five countries when you are on holiday or travelling to work and wish to take your pets with you. This regulation on pets will go down in history. It is, in fact, the first legal act since the Treaty of Lisbon and we wanted a level playing field with the Council of Ministers in the empowerment of the Commission for delegated acts. That was an uphill struggle, but it was worth it. My congratulations to Mrs De Brún for this report and, of course, for this procedure to begin a new era. That is why it is so important, because we have perhaps a hundred legal acts in a year, but 6 000 delegated acts, and from this we can gauge how important it is to set the new procedure on the right track from the beginning.

 Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, following the disappointing conclusion to the climate conference in Copenhagen, Parliament is using this resolution to make it clear that there is no alternative to climate protection and that, as we move towards the next conference in Mexico, we must increase rather than decrease our efforts in this area. I shall be brief. Amendment 6 from the Group of the Progressive Alliance of Socialists and Democrats in the European Parliament was intended to serve this purpose. However, as it has been worded confusingly, we are withdrawing it. Nevertheless, we do support Amendments 1 and 9 from the Group of the Alliance of Liberals and Democrats for Europe and the Group of the Greens/European Free Alliance, which call on the EU to do more en route to Mexico. Climate protection must not come to a standstill. I would ask for your support. Jo Leinen,

Madam President, Madam President-in-Office of the Council, Mr Samecki, 2010 is the International Year of Biodiversity and the EU is about to press ahead with a new strategy for biodiversity, in other words, for the protection of flora and fauna within the area of the European Union. It would greatly enhance the credibility of the European Union if we were also to work on an international level to protect endangered flora and fauna globally and to give this our support. There will be an opportunity for this next month at the 15th Conference of the Parties to the Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species of Wild Fauna and Flora (CITES) in Doha. The EU must make itself a champion for all species which, as a result of various different factors, but in particular, over-exploitation or destructive and illegal practices, are endangered or even threatened with extinction. The Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Food Safety has debated this issue in detail and will table a proposal for a recommendation in plenary tomorrow, and we would be very pleased if the Council and the Commission were able to endorse these recommendations. Due to the time constraints, I will just mention a few example species which, in our opinion, are in need of a high or an even higher level of protection. Firstly, there is the African Elephant. We are most definitely opposed to the downlisting of this animal from Appendix I to Appendix II. The prohibition of international trade, particularly in ivory, must remain in place. Secondly, there is the Asian tiger. It is now on the brink of extinction, and we are demanding stricter protection regulations for many parties to the Convention, in particular to prevent the illegal trade in the body parts and derivatives of the tiger. We know that there is a large market for tiger bones and components of the tiger in Asia and this is threatening the existence of this animal. Thirdly, there is the protection of the polar bear. Climate change is threatening to destroy the habitat of this species and there is also an increase in trade in the body parts of polar bears. We are therefore in favour of uplisting the polar bear from Appendix II to Appendix I. I would also like to mention the protection of various species of shark. Various shark species are being over-fished, in particular the porbeagle and the spiny dogfish, but other shark species are also affected by this. Up to this point, there is consensus among us. I now come to the controversial issue. The source of the controversy is the classification of the Atlantic bluefin tuna, which is found in the Mediterranean and the Atlantic. Ladies and gentlemen, we are aware of the recommendations of the ad-hoc working group of the FAO, which wants to leave the Atlantic bluefin tuna in Appendix II. However, we are also aware of the proposal by the CITES scientific committee, which wants to uplist the Atlantic bluefin tuna to Appendix I. The background to this proposal is the data which reveals what is happening with this species. The stocks of Atlantic bluefin tuna declined by 75% between 1957 and 2007, and in the last ten years alone, there has been a decline of 60.9%. The risk to this fish is increasing and gaining momentum and therefore, the vast majority of us in the committee were of the opinion that this species should be included in Appendix I. This means that there will only be restrictions and prohibitions on international fishing fleets, not local fishing. Thus, the small, local fishermen can continue to catch this fish, and the preservation of the fish in the ecosystem is, in any case, more important than the general availability of sushi and sashimi. That is the conflict that we face. We need to take a long-term view and should provide proper protection for the Atlantic bluefin tuna in Appendix I. Jo Leinen  (S&amp;D

 Mr President, Mrs Espinosa, last week I attended the Informal Environment Council meeting in Seville. It was the first Council configuration under the Spanish Presidency. You were, of course, unable to attend due to an unfortunate family matter, but your Secretary of State, Teresa Ribera, did a splendid job of representing you. Throughout the meeting, which was extremely well organised, the commitment of the Spanish Presidency to the matter was evident. That is all well and good, but the result of this Council meeting was not very satisfactory. The Council of Ministers was divided, with a complete lack of direction. There is absolutely no agreement among Member States about what we should do now. That is not a good sign. It is your job and your responsibility to find the common denominator among the 27 Member States. In my opinion, we need to do three things in the European Union following Copenhagen. The first is that we must regain the leading role in global climate protection. Secondly, we need to show credibility in the commitments that we have made and, thirdly, we urgently need to gain new partners before we get to Mexico. With regard to regaining the leading role, I agree with everyone here who said that we should continue to state our promise to reduce carbon emissions by 30%. I would like to see us specify this 30% target to the UN Secretariat in Bonn on 31 January, not the old 20% target. If we make ourselves dependent on comparable efforts by others, it will take forever and Mexico will also come to nothing. In terms of showing credibility, the EUR 7.2 billion must actually be realised before Mexico. The countries in Africa need to be able to see that the first measures are already in progress. Finally, with regard to gaining partners, I hope that we will develop climate protection diplomacy and, with the help of the African Union in particular, that we will also find sufficient partners, including in Latin America and Asia, for a global agreement in Mexico.

 Mr President, an official delegation is representing Parliament in Copenhagen. You will also be attending and, for the first time, we do not have to rent an office in the city. Instead, we will have an official presence in the EU pavilion. This is good and we are grateful. Therefore, Article 61 is not needed. The Treaty of Lisbon ensures not only that Parliament will be listened to with regard to international treaties, but also that it has to agree to them. This is the beginning of a new era for us and, therefore, we are asking, in accordance with Article 60, to be admitted to the EU coordination meetings and not to be left standing outside the door. The Commission must treat us in the same way as it does the Council when it provides information about treaty negotiations and we are asking it to begin with the Kyoto agreement. This is our request to the Commission. Perhaps Mrs Reding would like to say something on this subject. (Applause) Jo Leinen,

 Mr President, Mr President-in-Office of the Council, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, in recent years, the European Parliament has been a driving force in the debate on climate protection, and we have also achieved a large percentage of the EU’s climate protection package. The resolution that we are putting forward today has all the elements for an ambitious agreement in Copenhagen. Yet what we are proposing is also realistic. It is both ambitious and realistic at the same time, and we hope that the Council and the Commission will join forces with us to form a single lobbying body at the conference in order to get other partners on board. The EU has taken on the leadership role in these issues and we want that to remain the case in Copenhagen. We must therefore stand by our offer of a 30% reduction in CO2
 by 2020. The science tells us that we need to be in the upper end between 25% and 40%. 30% would therefore still not be enough, we know that, and that is why we must actually offer this target, as it will drive up the ambition of other countries. We know that global climate protection is not possible without financing. In contrast to the Council, Parliament has given specific figures in this regard. The global framework is around EUR 100 billion, and Europe needs to take on around a third of that. So why do we not say that we will provide EUR 30 billion in 2020? Parliament has committed itself to this and I hope that the Council and the Commission will be equally specific in two weeks time. Mrs Wortmann-Kool has already mentioned the kick-start. We need EUR 5 to 7 billion straight away. When I look at how much money we made available for the banking crisis, we are really talking about peanuts to overcome the climate crisis – and there will be no second chance at this. Once the climate has been broken, it will be broken forever and we will not be able to fix it. This really has to deserve a major effort from us all, therefore. I also note that some countries are moving, but others are not. It must not be the case that the two greatest climate polluters, China and the United States, play a giant game of ping-pong where each accuses the other whilst dragging its own feet. That is irresponsible and I hope that the US, in particular, will also show leadership in Copenhagen, with specific information on reductions in its own climate-change gases and also a share of the financing. Without these two countries and without India, there will be no agreement. We emphasise forestry policy once again – deforestation is a major factor – as well as aviation and maritime transport. If railways are included in the emissions trading and have to pay, I can no longer see why aviation and maritime transport should have such special privileges. At long last, Parliament will be represented in the EU pavilion for the first time. That is a new beginning, and I hope we are able to take part in the briefing between the Council and the Commission since, under the Treaty of Lisbon, we have joint legislative power on the Copenhagen agreement. Jo Leinen  (S&amp;D

 Mr President, the demand from Václav Klaus for an addition to the Charter of Fundamental Rights is both arbitrary and superfluous. However, it is easy to oppose, because the charter refers only to EU law and applies only to the future. Therefore, if necessary, the Council should make a political declaration. In a few weeks, the ratification of the treaty, which we have been waiting nine years for, should then take place. The European Council must make the necessary preparations, but should not jump to any hasty conclusions. This applies also to the European External Action Service. The High Representative is responsible for proposing a concept for the service, not the Council bureaucracy. I would therefore ask the Council Presidency to ensure that the service is not in a position off to one side, but can integrate itself into the community system, as Mr Barroso has said. This treaty gives us the legal basis for a common energy policy and for a common climate protection policy. I can only hope that the fog lifts before Copenhagen, because we must not leave these questions open until the conference. The Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Food Safety has made clear demands, including with regard to financing. I hope that there will be agreement on a financing concept next week at the summit. Furthermore, we need internal burden-sharing within the EU. Germany and other countries must give way, as we need a fair deal both within the EU and between the EU and the developing countries throughout the world. Jo Leinen,

Madam President, Commissioner Olli Rehn has praised this Parliament for its activities in bringing about the climate protection package and, in fact, we aim to continue to be ambitious. Last night, the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Food Safety voted 55-1 in favour of adopting a resolution that sets high targets for the negotiations in Copenhagen. This result shows that the denial of climate change, the ignorance of these matters, is represented by a vanishingly small minority of individuals here in this House whose views really should be disregarded and who have made their views known here on a number of occasions, but who are actually swimming against the tide of opinion of the citizens of all the countries of the European Union. It makes no difference to the Earth’s atmosphere where the CO2
 comes from. That means that we need a global agreement for every country and not – as is already being argued in Bangkok – multiple agreements, with one for the US, one for Europe and one for the developing countries – that would be disastrous. We need a global pact against climate change and that means that we also need a global pact of solidarity of the rich countries with the poor ones. This point has already been made many times. Climate change represents an opportunity for us and also for the developing countries to set in motion low-carbon development with new technologies, together with the modernisation of the infrastructure. Europe must help this come about. When it comes to funding, we have endorsed the demand that the EU needs EUR 30 billion by 2020 and that we must develop funding tools that are durable and predictable. They must not simply be dependent on funds from the budget, but must also have other sources of funding. I want to stress, once again, that marine transport and aviation must be included and that, of course, the forests and agriculture have their own, significant share. Development and climate protection are not opposites – rather, they must be brought together into a synthesis in Copenhagen. Jo Leinen  (S&amp;D

 Mr President, after eight years and many debates and negotiations, there is a real chance now that this Reform Treaty will enter into force, thanks also to the hard work of many people in this House who were committed to this project from beginning to end in the Convention and later in the intergovernmental conferences. I believe that Parliament has played a constructive part in this Reform Treaty. I think that, if the constitutional court in Prague in the Czech Republic gives a positive ruling, there will no longer be any legal grounds for President Klaus to block the EU any further. The other constitutional bodies in the Czech Republic will also find ways to overcome any such illegal blockade. We are, of course, hearing that there is a new threat of trouble from the United Kingdom. However, if a British Government were to allow a referendum, then it would not be on the Treaty of Lisbon but on whether the British people are in favour of the EU or whether they want to pull out of Europe. That would have to be the subject of the referendum and not a treaty that has been ratified. That would be totally unacceptable. I think we need to learn something from this, and that is that our citizens need more information. I therefore hope that, in the new Commission, we will also get a vice-president for communication and for information and perhaps even a commissioner for European citizenship. That would be the answer to these controversies on European policy. Jutta Haug  (S&amp;D

Mr President, Commissioners, ladies and gentlemen, the extraordinary meeting of the European Council is now imminent and we are talking ourselves to a standstill in an effort to achieve harmony. The extraordinary meeting has one sole purpose: to develop the Council’s mandate for the negotiations on the multiannual financial framework. As part of the preparations, two inter-related negotiating boxes have been produced. To put it bluntly, we are not satisfied, and we cannot possibly be satisfied with what has been presented. We are also annoyed, to put it mildly, by the Council’s conduct on budgetary issues, which can be described in one word: irresponsible! We can only repeat what we said in June last year, namely that we need a proper system of own resources which is worthy of the name. The Commission has taken a first small step, but this is not enough. There is almost nothing we need more urgently than these genuine own resources, for they would mean that the European budget would no longer be dependent on national contributions. We need this independence to put an end to this untenable situation. There would also be no further logic to the arguments being advanced in some Member States. As Mr Reul has just said, the debate there is only ever about payments, contributions and spending. They never discuss political priorities, their priorities. They never tell us what they would like to achieve with the European budget. No ideas are forthcoming about the future of the European Union. The Council is not acting like a European institution. Instead, it has become a collection of 27 sets of national self-interest, where they all bicker like children  The budget is like a pie, and yes, there should be pie, but they squabble over which ingredients they should provide and how big their slice of the pie should be. Everyone wants to eat and no one wants to bake. It is appalling! Jutta Haug  (S&amp;D

– (DE) 
Madam President, Commissioners, ladies and gentlemen, the next multiannual financial framework and the amount of funding and the policies we want to finance are the focus of our discussions and disagreements here as we seek to reach a consensus, but this is only one side of the coin, namely the expenditure side. However, we must work on the other side of the coin as well, namely the revenue side. That is nothing new. For almost 20 years, the European Parliament has been calling for a more transparent, fairer and simpler system of own resources. Now, for the first time, we can lend weight to this demand.  In the SURE report last June, we called for a system of own resources which would abolish all of the rebates and make the revenue side of the EU budget completely independent of the contributions made by Member States. The Commission took account of these demands, at least to some extent, by proposing a reform of own resources from valued added tax and the introduction of a Financial Transaction Tax. We support this proposal by the Commission, even though it only amounts to a 40 % reform. It is at least a step forward, and what is more, it moves in the right direction.  The European Union has won the Nobel Peace Prize. This was intended to be an expression of gratitude but also an incentive to go further. A more peaceful approach could also be achieved if the constant bean-counting between the net contributors and the net recipients were consigned to the past following a reform of the revenue system. A genuinely European revenue stream would also highlight the European value added of the EU budget. Then this constant small-minded national bean-counting could finally stop. Jutta Haug,

Mr President, President of the Council, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, the Committee on the Environment would like to remind you that, although it is responsible only for an infinitesimal part of the European budget, we will certainly not achieve the aims of the Europe 2020 strategy if we do not commit sufficient appropriations to the programmes and measures relating to environment and climate action and biodiversity. That is why we have reinstated the totally incomprehensible cuts the Council made to the Commission proposal. After all, the Commission did also subscribe to the commitment to sustained growth. In any case, the Commission was already being very cautious when it drew up the budget. It provided for a rise of no more than 0.72 % for climate and environment policy. In plain words, that simply means a cut. For the inflation rate is in fact 2 %. Even more dubious is what the Council is doing with the agencies. Let us make it quite clear: the Commission has already included the minus 1 % for staff in its proposal, and, moreover, it is as usual also reducing the appropriations the agencies regard as necessary. That means the available budget for the agencies is pretty low from the outset. And then the Council comes along and snips away at it even more. Soon we will be down to the bare bones! This most affects the agencies to which the legislator, i.e. the Council and the EP together, have transferred new tasks. They cannot fulfil them if they do not receive adequate funding. We expect the Commission to produce a supplementary and rectifying budget as soon as possible in any case and at all events. We expect the Council to take on board our good arguments when it negotiates with Parliament. We know that the Council is incorruptible, but surely it can at least see reason! Jutta Haug  (S&amp;D

 Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, in unity, strength. That is what they say. We ought not to be wasting our energy among ourselves, therefore, because the vast majority of us – Parliament, Council and Commission – are in agreement: Europe needs growth, and Europe needs jobs. How, then, can we put this unity of analysis into action? That is where the European budget comes into play – the common budget that is a budget for investment with no compulsion for consolidation, because it has no debts. A European budget with adequate funds, an innovative structure and the necessary flexibility is quite simply our common instrument for leveraging existing growth potential in Europe, opening up new prospects and maintaining our position in the global competition for talent, technologies and market leadership. The common European budget represents our joint European opportunity, our added value. That cannot be that hard to grasp; even the Council can do so. Jutta Haug,  
rapporteur for the opinion of the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Food Safety.

 Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, the Committee on the Environment is responsible for the budget lines for the environment, public health and food safety, and controls 0.76% of the Union’s budget. Overall, we were very pleased with the implementation rates. A full 99.26% of resources are tied up in the environment and climate change sector, while the figure in the LIFE programme, our flagship and our only financial instrument for the environment, was 99.4%. The rate was also above 99% in the health sector too. All the available information leads us to the recommendation that the Commission should be granted discharge. I have been dealing with agencies in various capacities for seven and a half years. These seven and a half years have taught me that it is the decentralised agencies that do the lion’s share of the work in Europe, fulfilling the tasks assigned to them by the legislators, Parliament and Council under the ordinary legislative procedure. For seven and a half years, I have seen how the agencies are under particularly close public scrutiny. More than ever before, the specialist committees are particularly rigorous in exercising political control over the agencies. We want to know what staff in the agencies do, how they do it, and what happens with the resources from the Community budget. The agencies’ budgets are not arbitrarily organised in the budgetary process, nor are the agencies absolved of responsibility in the discharge process. However, during these seven and a half years, I have never experienced so many half-truths, insinuations and misinformation being used to create an atmosphere of distrust and suspicion towards the agencies and the people working in them during the discharge process. This is not worthy of the working practices normally followed in this House. This fatal combination is the reason why the Committee on Budgetary Control has applied to defer the discharge for three agencies, the Medicines Agency, the Environment Agency and the Food Safety Authority. Of course, I support criticism of excessively high carry-overs to the next year and of the extremely high cost of governing body meetings. However, these issues do not justify the deferral of the discharge. Speaking from my seven and a half years of experience working with agencies, I can only recommend that our decision in relation to granting discharge should not be based on an unholy mix of half-truths, misinformation and insinuations. With all the information available to us, we can confidently grant discharge to all agencies without exception. Jutta Haug,

We are in the same position in the budget process for 2012 that we find ourselves in every year: faced by a Council that does not understand the issues. As always, the Council has cut the appropriations for the Commission, even the not very large amount for the environment and climate change, for public health and for food and feed safety. Together with the four agencies, this amounts to just under EUR 1 billion, in other words, all of 0.67% of the EU budget. Therefore, we are very pleased that the Committee on Budgets has complied with all our requests and has restored the funding from the draft budget in all cases. At this point I would like to give my warm congratulations to the rapporteur. Ms Balzani has done an excellent job. We are also pleased that the package which has been negotiated includes seven pilot projects and three preparatory actions from the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Food Safety. We have never been as successful as this in the past. All that remains now is for us all, together with the Council – and perhaps it will work – to ensure that good results for the citizens of Europe come out of the negotiations. Jutta Haug  (S&amp;D

 Madam President, Mr Barroso, Mr Dowgielewicz, the Commission’s legislative proposal has been described by Mr Barroso as ambitious, but realistic and sensible. Having listened to the dismissive and highly critical reactions from various capital cities in our wonderful European Union, it would be easy to believe this. However, if you read the proposal, which is what Parliament does, unlike many areas of government and the large majority of journalists, you get the very clear impression that the time when the Commission was regarded as the engine of European integration and development is finally over. The Commission has failed to meet Parliament’s expectations with regard to the structure of the budget, levels of spending and the extent of the reform of the own resources system. To give one example of revenues, Parliament has said that we want our budget to be based entirely on own resources as laid down in the Treaty. Therefore, we aim to replace the transfers from the Member States completely. At the same time, we want to bring an end to all rebates. What does the Commission do? It proposes replacing less than half of the Member States’ contributions with real own resources and no longer calculating the rebates, but simply applying a flat rate. Well, my goodness! It would have been better if we had at least reached this point only as the result of long negotiations between Parliament and the Council, as a compromise achieved, as far as I am concerned, with the help of the Commission. We in Parliament had hoped that the Commission, as the champion of a Europe-centric policymaking approach, would be on our side during the negotiations with the Council, but now we are anticipating the inevitable discussions with very mixed feelings. Jutta Haug  (S&amp;D

 Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, a year ago, the plenary agreed and mandated a special committee to draft the position of the European Parliament in relation to the next financial perspective. Now, following exactly eleven months of work, the Policy Changes Committee is presenting the fruits of its labours. This was a task that required discipline and concentration and that could only be achieved by adopting an approach characterised by openness, solidarity and mutual trust. For that, let me express my sincerest gratitude to those Members involved in the creative process. The report we have produced, drawn up under the leadership of Mr Garriga Polledo, is a genuinely good result. It is something of which we can be proud. However, as we all know, good results require not just hard-working Members, but also excellent staff. We certainly had this, not just in the shape of our personal assistants and our group staff, but also, above all, in an excellent secretariat. This super team, led by Monika Strasser, was not just competent and professional, but was also more than usually interested in its work. It was patient and creative, extremely well organised, and, at the same time, spontaneous and flexible. Best of all, it was always cheerful and open. They obviously enjoyed all the hard work. I would like to thank this nine-strong team from the bottom of my heart. Thank you very much indeed. (Applause)
 From the outset, Mr Garriga Polledo and I wanted to deliver a report that could be supported by three quarters of Parliament. We actually received a majority of more than four fifths in the vote in committee. We were very pleased with this. Our call for a seven-year financial perspective which is expressed in a structure that reflects the objectives of the Europe 2020 strategy, while, at the same time, respecting all the policies for the European Union and avoiding increasing the European budget to unrealistic levels, must be seen to be reasonable. It is realistic and achievable. Our report contains 174 paragraphs, all of them arguments for more Europe. We genuinely need more Europe. Please read the report. It offers the best basis for convincing our citizens in local debate and for entering into serious negotiations with the Council, which is unfortunately notable by its absence today. Thank you for your excellent work. Jutta Haug,  
rapporteur for the opinion of the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Food Safety

 Madam President, President-in-Office of the Council, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Food Safety has expressed a very positive opinion to the Committee on Budgetary Control. We were very pleased with how the funds had been implemented by the Commission services. We have no criticisms to make, either as regards the way in which the funds were spent or as regards the level of expenditure. On the contrary, we have nothing but praise for the prompt and positive use of the funds in the LIFE programme. The Commission has succeeded in spending the additional funding that we granted and in doing so usefully. The agencies in our area – the European Environment Agency (EEA), the European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control (ECDC), the European Chemicals Agency (ECA), the European Food Safety Authority (EFSA) and the European Medicines Agency (EMA) – have also managed their money responsibly. In contrast to the competent committee, the Committee on Budgetary Control criticises the European Medicines Agency in its report and even wishes to refuse discharge for this agency. I think that is going too far, to put it politely. If I were being less polite I might say that the Committee on Budgetary Control is interfering in matters outside its sphere of competence. It should please stop doing so. I can only ask Parliament and plenary to improve matters in this respect. Jutta Haug  (S&amp;D
),  
in writing. 
– Though not very ambitious, the first reading compromise improves the current legislation – I therefore voted in favour. Besides the new methodology for substance restrictions, one key improvement is the open scope: all electric and electronic equipment, including equipment for the generation of electric currents, will in the medium term fall under the RoHS legislation. A major drawback, however, is the long list of exclusions, including photovoltaic panels. Excluding this decisive ‘clean’ technology from environmental legislation will send the wrong signal, EU-wide and globally. This is about setting the right regulatory framework for coherent sustainable investments! Even if the production of photovoltaic panels with hazardous substances like cadmium telluride might be more cost-efficient, less problematic alternatives have existed for a long time and have proved to function excellently. I do not see any need, therefore, to cover our roofs and fields with potentially hazardous waste, shifting the disposal challenge to future generations. On this point, I strongly disagree with the position and decision of the EP’s and Council’s majority. Jutta Haug,  
rapporteur for the opinion of the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Food Safety.

 Mr President, Mr Wathelet, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, as rapporteur for the opinion of the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Food Safety regarding the budget, I will not be telling anyone here present anything new. Nevertheless, I would like to point out once again that the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Food Safety is responsible for less than 1% of the budget as a whole, less than 1% of all environmental protection actions, biodiversity actions and actions in the fight against climate change. It is responsible for the whole area of public health, for food and feed safety, and for veterinary measures, as well as for the extremely important work of five European agencies. 1%! Well, in that case, it is certainly not possible to talk of excessive quantities of money. This small amount of money is therefore desperately needed for carrying out our work. It will therefore be no surprise to anyone that we are unable to accept the Council’s cuts. We need the resources. Jutta Haug  (S&amp;D
). 
 – (DE) 
Mr President, Commissioner, I will say right at the outset that I think it is a good document that we have before us here. It is balanced, as Mr Lewandowski has always promised us – balanced with a large number of suggestions and ideas for how we can, and should, continue to work. However, it is not what we as budget specialists in the Committee on Budgets expected. To be honest, we thought there would be an analysis of the current financial framework, and the real optimists even believed that we might also get a small revision for the remaining period of the current financial perspective. However, what we have before us now is purely a glance into the future. Almost every other section mentions how we should do things better in future with regard to our budget, whether in relation to our priorities, how to achieve the goals of the Europe 2020 strategy, better cooperation with our neighbours, better European infrastructure or our future agricultural policy and cohesion policy. This paper even presents ideas with regard to the future structure of our budget and the length of the next financial period. (The President cut off the speaker) Jutta Haug,  
rapporteur for the opinion of the Committee on Budgets.
 – (DE)
 Mr President, Mr Wathelet, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, our two rapporteurs have already provided an evaluation of the Council’s position, and now it is my turn to speak on behalf of the Committee. I would like to say right at the start that I am certain that the Belgian Presidency will do as good a job as it possibly can. However, it can only do its job as well as it is permitted to do by the Council as a whole. Unfortunately, we have to admit that, in this regard, the result is poor. The Council has, as usual – and I cannot remember things ever being any different – gone round busily deleting and cutting parts of the Commission’s draft, in terms of both the commitments and the payments. It has done this all over the place at random – and that is also the usual procedure. It has not looked to see where this could possibly make sense and where not. The result is more than EUR 780 million less in commitments and EUR 3.6 billion less in payments. If we look at who this affects in particular, we see that once again, it is the decentralised agencies. We established these agencies together by means of legislation. Both Parliament and the Council were involved, otherwise there would be no agencies. However, if we do not make available to them the funds they need to enable them to do exactly what we have tasked them with doing, we ought to shut them down. Otherwise, every euro we give them really is money down the drain. The same thing applies to the executive agencies. The Commission has already mentioned this. If we bleed dry the executive agencies that are supposed to implement the multiannual programmes that have been decided by law, these programmes are finished. Do we really want that to happen? Elements in the Council hold pious speeches about how Europe must make greater efforts to be, or to become, competitive. In the budget procedure, however, it is precisely those parts of the budget that are intended to promote growth and competitiveness that are being cut, in other words, category Ia. The structural policy figures are being affected in a similar way. Where there are now real requirements for funds from the regions, funding is being reduced by EUR 1 billion. That can hardly be regarded as logical, and it is certainly not wise. We would really like those with the political responsibility to look closely at the content of our budget – the content! – and, in so doing, to have Europe and its added value for citizens in mind and in sight. Then they will indeed find a suitable partner for discussion in us. Jutta Haug  (S&amp;D

Madam President, it is a little unusual, but I must inform my own group that our voting list for the Trüpel report is not correct in the form that we have laid it down. There has been a misunderstanding. We reject all the amendments, except our own. Jutta Haug,  
rapporteur for the opinion of the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Food Safety. 
– (DE)
 Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I would just like to address one point, a point that really is a scandal. I am talking about the European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control, the ECDC in Stockholm. Since May 2005, highly qualified people there have had to work in an absolutely hostile environment. Until now, the Swedish Government has been unable to conclude an accord de siege
 with the ECDC, although they desperately wanted this agency, like all Member States always badly want an agency. To this day, none of the employees have a personal identity number, the so-called Folkbokföring
 number. However, this number is used by public administrations, institutions and private companies to identify their customers. Consequently, children born in Sweden cannot be registered, for example, providers of electricity, gas, telecommunications and television withhold their services, landlords refuse long-term tenancy agreements and there are problems accessing doctors and hospitals. For spouses, it means it is impossible to become self-employed in Sweden. There are also enormous difficulties in getting a job. The list could go on. One thing is clear: certain fundamental rights anchored in European law are simply being denied to the staff at the ECDC in Sweden. As a result, all of this has landed before our Committee on Petitions. In any case, the situation is untenable …. (The President cut off the speaker) Jutta Haug,  
rapporteur.

Mr President, Mr President-in-Office of the Council, Commissioner, when we debated this year’s budget in December of last year, we were already aware and, as general rapporteur for the 2009 budget, I mentioned in the discussion that the impact of the financial market crisis and its repercussions on the real economy would be felt in all the Member States. This is exactly what has happened. In April 2009, Parliament and the Council agreed on the funding for the first part of the economic stimulus proposed by the Commission. In order to make the EUR 2.6 billion available, we needed what was referred to as a minor revision of the financial perspective. How would we have been able to find the funds otherwise, given our tight budgetary constraints? The remaining EUR 2.4 billion, which was missing from the total of EUR 5 billion, was to be found this autumn. This is where we are now. Autumn is here and, because Parliament and the Council have come to a sensible arrangement on the 2010 budget, we have a solution. The 2009 budget is also making a significant contribution to this solution. The 2010 supplementary and amending budget cuts the payment appropriations by more than EUR 3.4 billion. In line with this, the margins of the unused areas under the different headings will be reduced by almost EUR 1.5 billion. All of this applies to the 2009 budget, which consists of EUR 133.8 billion in commitment appropriations and EUR 116.1 billion in payment appropriations, and is therefore not exactly on a lavish scale. If we take a look at the budget lines where the Commission found the necessary money, it becomes abundantly clear that the Commission simply does not take the budgetary authority’s resolutions seriously. I would like to remind Parliament that in 2008, when we adopted the 2009 budget, our priorities were also the competitiveness of the European Union, growth and employment. This is why we allocated more money than proposed by the Commission to budget lines which promoted the social dimension by creating more and better jobs and supporting small and medium-sized enterprises. However, it is precisely these budget lines which are being plundered for transfers or amending budgets. Would it be asking too much to call on the Commission to implement the resolutions of Parliament and the Council and to make an effort to ensure that the money reaches its intended destinations where it will have a positive impact? The draft budget submitted to us by the Commission has not been accurately calculated or carefully estimated. In 2009, we had more than 50 transfers and 10 supplementary and amending budgets. It is not possible to talk about budgetary accuracy and clarity in this context and this situation must improve. Our fellow Members in the specialist committees must pay greater attention to the implementation reports in the course of the financial year and the Commission must finally live up to the good reputation that it still has of being an effective European administrative body. I hope that we will all work towards this. Jutta Haug,  
rapporteur.

 Mr President, I would like to thank all my fellow Members. We have managed to find a common position with regard to the Council. However, I would also like to thank the Council and the Presidency of the Council very warmly at this point. Anyone who knows me will be aware that I am normally very sparing with praise and thanks. Nevertheless, I would like to express my sincere gratitude to the Swedish Presidency and, in particular, Mr Lindblad, for its work and its constant presence during the discussions on budget issues. This made a pleasant contrast to the other Council presidencies that I have experienced during the course of my long career as a Member of Parliament. Thank you very much. This morning, many Members took part in the discussion and I believe that on this occasion, there were many more Members involved than usual. The majority of them referred to the limitations of the budget and its structure. Ladies and gentlemen, we can confidently assume that the 2010 budget will be the last of its kind, the last with this structure, which leads us to believe that we can finance the necessary policies of the European Union and its new challenges and tasks in this way. We expect the new Commission to carry out the mid-term review quickly, as, under the terms of the agreements made in 2006, this should have been submitted by 2009 at the latest, in other words, by the end of this year. To spell it out, we also expect a revision proposal for the current financial perspective. We cannot wait until 2014 for reform. We need sustainable instruments now, so that the European Union can meet the challenges of the immediate future with democratic legitimacy, as the Chair of the Committee on Budgets, Mr Lamassoure, has just called for on behalf of all of us. Jutta Haug,  
draftsman of the opinion of the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Food Safety

 Ladies and gentlemen, it is no secret that the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Food Safety takes the view time and again – this year included – that the funds provided in the European budget absolutely do not suffice to provide effective environmental programmes, to maintain our biodiversity and for a fight against climate change that has a chance of succeeding. The fact that the Council makes even further cuts from these meagre funds is as incomprehensible as ever. That is why ‘back to the preliminary draft budget’ is the standard response. There are two things that we must impress on the Commission. The first of these is that we expect it to immediately include what are known as the ‘assigned revenues’ for those agencies that are partly dependent on fees – such as the European Medicines Agency in London or the European Chemicals Agency in Helsinki – in the preliminary draft budget and not to achieve an artificial margin by omitting them. The second point is that we expect the Commission to bring forward a proposal as soon as possible for how it will fund the anti-smoking campaign Help 
in future after the tobacco fund has run out. You see, it is the same every time. Jutta Steinruck  (S&amp;D
),  
in writing.
 – (DE) 
When we vote tomorrow on the own-initiative report on a Social Investment Pact, it will become apparent whether we finally have a cross-party understanding of how we need to tackle the crisis. Our collective response must be not simply cost-cutting measures, but specific measures to achieve the Europe 2020 targets. We can achieve these targets, but it will not happen by itself. If we want more jobs, we must make it possible for our economy to employ more people. Between 2008 and 2011, there was a 4 % fall in output in Europe (from 20 % to 16 %) which resulted in an 11 % fall in employment. On the one hand, that means that we have to invest in places where new jobs are needed. On the other hand, it also means that we have to pay special attention to the nature of these jobs: jobs must be sustainable and must offer decent employment conditions. The crisis must not be an excuse for low wages and social dumping! Europe’s economic policy must be expanded to include a compensatory social policy. We in particular, as the European Parliament, must resolutely uphold the interests of the individual in Europe. Accordingly, I would urge honourable Members to press energetically for European workers to be given back their right to decent employment! Jutta Steinruck  (S&amp;D
),  
in writing.
 – (DE)
 The working conditions of women in the service sector are still not how we would like them to be. A quarter of all non-typical employees work in the service sector; in the German retail trade, there are almost a million so-called ‘mini-jobs’. Working women, who represent eight out of 10 of those employed in the service sector, are particularly strongly affected by this. We have already achieved a great deal in respect of equality between men and women, and we are on the right path to achieving even more. However, in the context of services, specifically, it is particularly important that agreement is finally reached on the Posting of Workers Directive. Women are particularly strongly affected by this: 58% of all the women working in posted positions in Germany work in the service sector. The percentage of female workers in, for example, care work is considerably higher than in many other sectors, and the working conditions are often very poor. What we need are minimum wage rates, limits on working hours and safety standards that are reasonable for all female workers in Europe. We can only achieve these objectives if we lay down clear rules for the posting of workers by temporary employment agencies. I am therefore pleased to see that the rapporteur takes up the subject of mobility in her opinion. We advocate a clearly regulated legal framework for Europe’s internal market in the field of services in order to prevent precarious labour relations and discrimination. Jutta Steinruck  (S&amp;D
),

 As rapporteur for the Programme for Social Change and Innovation, which integrates the three programmes EURES, Progress and the European Progress Microfinance Facility, I would like to draw attention to two specific matters. The Committee on Employment and Social Affairs rejected the Commission proposal to finance the cross-border partnerships through the European Social Fund (ESF) from 2014 onwards. If the financing of these partnerships were only to be possible within the framework of the ESF, each participating Member State would have to include this in its operational programme for the ESF. In view of the many priority areas for subsidies that is unlikely to happen. Cross-border partnerships for mobility-related advice must also be financed via the EURES axis. This call is supported across the groups and across the Member States, and I am hoping for the support of the Council. It is a question of facilitating mobility and of providing the associated advice. With a broad consensus and the support of all of the groups, we have introduced a fourth axis for a Youth Initiative. This is about financing specific projects for combating youth unemployment. The Youth Initiative will only be integrated into the programme if additional financing is secured via the multiannual financial framework. The Commission and the Council are always saying that something has to be done to combat youth unemployment, but there is a lack of projects. If combating youth unemployment really is a priority for the Council then this is the opportunity to prove it. Jutta Steinruck  (S&amp;D
).

 Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, in view of the economic problems, the crisis and the challenges faced by European companies, their employees, creditors and other shareholders and stakeholders, EU company law needs to focus on a sustainable, forward-looking corporate model characterised by long-term thinking. I am therefore asking you to pursue the aims of a social Europe. As part of that, you need to look at the involvement of workers in corporate decisions. You should also involve the social partners in your initiatives. After all, businesses have a social responsibility towards society and in respect of their contribution to growth and employment. In all your proposals, you must ensure that, as far as possible, existing rules on codetermination cannot be bypassed or eroded. We need the highest possible standards in European companies and we need corporate decisions to involve all those affected. Jutta Steinruck  (S&amp;D
),  
in writing.
 – (DE)
 I expect the European Commission to finally learn the lessons of the crisis. There are some good ideas, but there is a lack of commitment. I welcome proposals such as support for start-ups, the overdue consultation paper on the quality framework for internships, or the youth initiative to give young people some career prospects. However, well-intentioned proposals do not reduce youth unemployment. Improving the quality of work and strong codetermination must remain key elements of European policy. I reject the idea of the uniform contract of employment, which is another attempt to erode protection from termination of employment. I also take a highly critical view of a new tripartite pay monitoring committee at European level. The EU Treaty excludes the possibility of intervening in wage setting. It must stay that way. Along with the trade unions, we in the Group of the Progressive Alliance of Socialists and Democrats in the European Parliament would warn against using the crisis to undermine the autonomy of the social partners.

 2007 was the ‘European Year of Equal Opportunities’. Five years later and Europe is still at square one. It is true that we have established the legal principle of the same remuneration for men and women. Nonetheless, wage inequality for men and women still exists. We are making little or no progress. I am pleased, therefore, that, as well as setting targets, the rapporteur has also provided some specific, detailed recommendations in her report. We need collective redress when this principle of equal pay is violated. It must be possible to obtain prosecutions for wage discrimination. We are calling for awareness campaigns dealing with wage inequality for men and women. We need wage equality officers in the various Member States. This will enable progress in the Member States to be monitored more effectively. We need to make specific progress. In this case specific progress means pursuing legal initiatives requiring equal pay for men and women. Jutta Steinruck  (S&amp;D

Blue-card question.

 Mr Clark, you and some of the previous speakers have mentioned a reduction in red tape as a cure-all to get rid of youth unemployment in Europe. I would be very interested to know, however, what exactly you mean by that, and whether you are also aware of the consequences of certain measures. Jutta Steinruck  (S&amp;D
). 
 – (DE)
 Madam President, Commissioner, many of the previous speakers have already mentioned that we are on the way to losing a generation of young people. I think that we all also agree that it is high time that something was done. Initial proposals were made in January this year or in December, so we have already wasted a couple of years with nothing but declarations of intent and a failure to tackle things in concrete terms; instead, responsibilities have been shifted to and fro at European level. I hope that is now in the past. Single-minded austerity is destroying the jobs of our young people. Growth creates jobs and training places, including for the young people of Europe, and also saves the costs of future social expenditure. What we need now is a rescue package for young people, for young Europeans, that is given just as much priority as was the rescue package for the banks. We found it easy to spend EUR 800 billion on rescuing the banks. It was right, and it was important, but we have to do it just as vehemently for something that will be much more important to us in the future, or at least equally as important. Alternatively, what about the EUR 82 billion that has not been spent from the Structural Funds? As the previous speaker has already said, we need to call off the money. That would give us EUR 15 000 to spend on each unemployed young person in Europe, if that would simplify things. Moreover, as the previous speaker mentioned, we also have to use the Structural Funds for this in the future. Together with my shadow rapporteurs, I have started initiatives for my report on the Programme for Social Change and Innovation, so that we very specifically allocate funding for a youth initiative. I hope, then, that I will also have the support of this Parliament, of the Commission and also of the Council in getting this funding, since everyone says that it is so important, and that this will also be anchored today in the other funds. This money could be very well used for the future of us all. Jutta Steinruck  (S&amp;D
). 
 – (DE)
 Mr President, I, too, would like to thank the rapporteur and, like the previous speaker, I welcome this regulation, on which we will be voting today. Europe’s internal market provides benefits for the workers, too, but sadly, in the past, loopholes in the law have been exploited in relation to cross-border mobility. One example of this – and this has been mentioned by a few of the previous speakers – concerns the airline business. Flight routes were often consciously chosen in such a way that airline staff were often socially insured in the Member State where social security was cheapest for the airline. This distorted competition, and it is an example of wage and social dumping, which takes place time and again at the expense of the workers. That is why we, as European Social Democrats, fought hard to ensure that airline staff are socially insured and have to pay their taxes where they are stationed. In a social Europe, there is no room for businesses that exploit the advantages of Europe’s single market while shirking the social responsibility that is the other side of the same coin. Jutta Steinruck  (S&amp;D
). 
 – (DE) 
Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, without quotas I would not be a Member of this House, but I am also self-confident enough to say that I do not do my work badly, nor am I a bad politician. I believe that the quotas fulfil their purpose, since, in the past, we had 100% male quotas, and the time has come for us to do away with them. The reality is that there is progress when it comes to equal rights for women in Europe. It may be at a snail’s pace, but fortunately the movement is in the right direction. Especially in times of crisis such as those in which we find ourselves at the moment, it becomes particularly clear that there is still major discrimination against women in the European labour market. Women are the first to be fired, in traditional female professions our salaries are currently going backwards in many cases, and women in executive roles continue to be in short supply, despite better qualifications from secondary and tertiary education. Today we have discussed how women in Europe – and this is not news to us – continue to earn less than their male colleagues. It is not enough to talk about this and to debate it, however. Ultimately, we have to also start to change fundamental structures. Professions that are mainly occupied by women are, as a rule, less well paid. We need new and more objective ways of evaluating work, while greater transparency in respect of salaries would also be an important step towards equal pay. The culture of silence in business keeps women in the dark about the fact that they earn less. If we had more transparency within companies, women could defend themselves better against this, and this needs to be tackled now, just as we need quotas on boards of directors, in executive roles or even in political positions. Jutta Steinruck  (S&amp;D
),  
in writing.

 The budget consolidation must be based on the objectives of the Europe 2020 strategy. Since the beginning of the crisis, it has been clear that, in focusing on economic consolidation, the Commission and the Member States have forgotten that only balanced and socially just reforms will bring about sustainable growth. Unilateral austerity measures and cuts in social security funding will not result in a stable economy and good, secure jobs in the long term. Sensible tax policies must be introduced to increase revenue. The focus of our efforts this year must be on creating more jobs and combating youth unemployment and poverty. It is completely incomprehensible to me that the Group of the European People’s Party (Christian Democrats) has prevented Member States with a current account surplus from being required to help put an end to the recession and create jobs. This would have been a step towards a single European economic policy. The conservatives should finally understand that national egoism will only intensify the crisis. Jutta Steinruck  (S&amp;D
). 
 – (DE)
 Mr President, my question is for Commissioner Andor. As you know, my group has for quite some time been calling for the Posting of Workers Directive to be revised, and I find it very regrettable that the Commission has thus far not done so. It is not as if there is a shortage of reasons to do so: we have social dumping on a massive scale and the principle of equal treatment applies to too few criteria. Furthermore, there is often abuse of posted workers by means of failure to adhere to the rules. What we need is limits on subcontractor chains and more opportunities for information for workers. I therefore await the Commission’s proposals on the posting of workers package with baited breath. My question is this: how does the Commission proposal for the Enforcement Directive seek to tackle the problems with the Posting of Workers Directive that I have outlined? Most importantly, are there measures in the proposal to prevent the well-known problem of social dumping? Jutta Steinruck  (S&amp;D
). 
 – (DE)
 I have a specific follow-up question. You said that the aim was to improve on the original directive. In my initial question, I asked about limits on subcontractor chains, better opportunities for information for workers and better control mechanisms. I also wanted to know what specific steps are being taken to prevent social dumping in future. Jutta Steinruck  (S&amp;D
),  
in writing.

 I hope that today’s own-initiative report will be interpreted by the Commission in the way it was written by Parliament, because a directive on the transfer of company seats could have considerable negative effects on the rules on corporate codetermination. That applies not just to Germany, but throughout the European Union. The transfer of a company’s registered office could result in the loss of codetermination at corporate level. Transferring the company’s registered office to another country could allow the rules on corporate codetermination in Germany to be circumvented. At present, employees’ codetermination in a company is based on the Member State in which the company has its registered office. We are not talking about a nominal registered office; rather, the company must be registered where it actually has a genuine presence, such as business premises, employees, etc. In other words, it must have a genuine link with the state in which it is registered. We cannot allow the directive on transfers of company seats to be used to circumvent the rights of employees and creditors through the establishment of post-box offices abroad. If separation between the registered office and the administrative seat of a company is allowed, then social rights could effectively be eroded – and that is something we have to prevent. This can only work if the registered office of a company is in the country where it is actually based. That is the way to safeguard effectively the rights of employees in the European Union. I hope the Commission will safeguard social Europe, and the rights of its citizens, in its draft legislation. Jutta Steinruck  (S&amp;D

 Firstly, I would like to say that I am very pleased. This Presidency brings me pleasure in two ways. First of all, the Danish Government is headed by a woman and, secondly, she is a member of the right party. Given that 2012 is the ‘European Year for Active Ageing and Solidarity between the Generations’, I welcome the initiative by the Danish Presidency to encourage older people to join the labour market. The call for increased gender equality will also have a positive impact on labour markets throughout Europe. This is something that is urgently needed, in particular in the light of the demographic change which is underway in Europe. The younger generation has also not been forgotten. The focus will be on young people who leave the education system too early. The European Parliament has shown what it can do in this respect. During the negotiations on the so-called six-pack, we ensured that collective bargaining autonomy was protected as part of all the measures involved. The European Parliament will take this approach in many areas in future. We finally need to solve the problem of fiscal policy. Also, the regulation of the financial markets must remain high on the agenda. The European Parliament will work together with the Danish Presidency under the leadership of the social democratic Prime Minister Helle Thorning-Schmidt to resolve these issues. Jutta Steinruck,  
on behalf of the S&amp;D Group.

Madam President, I would like to thank the authors of the questions and the Commissioner for his statement. The German Social Democrats are also in favour of mobility and the free movement of workers on the European labour market. That is an important and key fundamental freedom. Although the facts dispel all fears, the German conservative-liberal Government is also no doubt planning to refuse to allow all workers to fully exercise this fundamental right. I find that very disappointing when I look at other European policy areas. In contrast to other countries, Germany has not made use of the transitional periods in order to make the German labour market fit for Europe. Time and again in Germany, I receive reports from colleagues from Romania and Bulgaria informing me of the methods being used in Germany. I can tell you that these are almost always bordering on illegal or are actually illegal. A further extension and a further denial of this fundamental right will only serve to promote fraud, undeclared employment and ostensible self-employment. It is not the influx of workers from Bulgaria and Romania that creates problems but the lack of fair conditions on the labour market. For us in Germany, these include the lack of a minimum wage and too little control of undeclared employment and combating of ostensible self-employment. Therefore, we must also put the principle of equal pay and equal working conditions for equal work in the same place into practice and introduce it in a uniform way at European level. Then, all workers within Europe will also be able to move around to work with dignity. (Applause) Jutta Steinruck  (S&amp;D

 I would like to thank Ms Delli for this report. The importance of health cannot be emphasised often enough. According to the European Agency for Safety and Health at Work in Bilbao, almost 28% of European workers claim to have significant health problems. This means that one in four workers in Europe is affected. Therefore, we must not only apply the existing occupational health legislation better in the Member States; we must also develop and improve it further, because the workplace is constantly changing, too. Whereas physical ailments were previously the top work-related illnesses, today it is mostly mental disorders that are on the rise in the workplace. This development, in particular, must be investigated thoroughly by means of improved health monitoring. The measures need to be adapted for this purpose. Prevention must also play a greater role. Furthermore, we must not forget that there are also certain groups whose health needs special protection. It has been proven that young, older and migrant workers and workers with precarious jobs are more frequently exposed to occupational hazards. If people are working without previous training or the necessary skills, the risk of disease or accident increases sharply. We must prevent this from happening. Jutta Steinruck  (S&amp;D

Madam President, this report is a good one and represents an important step in the right direction. Combating poverty and social exclusion is the responsibility of the Member States, but in the past, the national governments have not been sufficiently ambitious and have taken too few concrete measures. Well-meaning words are not enough. The current austerity policies in Europe, which have resulted in cuts in social budgets, are also creating more poverty in new areas. In the employment policy guidelines and the Europe 2020 strategy, we have set ourselves the goal of reducing the number of people at risk of poverty by 20 million. In my opinion, a key factor in this respect is employment, in the form of good jobs. A total of 8% of European employees are classified as working poor and 22% of the people at risk of poverty in Europe have a job. That is a quarter of the population. For this reason, we must begin by introducing fairer labour and social standards and minimum wages. Jutta Steinruck  (S&amp;D

The Professional Qualifications Directive is a key element in the integration of the labour market and an important step in achieving equal opportunities in European society. Many Member States have not yet implemented the directive and there are still far too many problems with recognition. This is also evident in the document from the Commission on which this own-initiative report is based. I welcome this report whole heartedly because it paves the way for the position the European Parliament is to adopt in relation to the promised revised directive at the beginning of next year. From an employment policy perspective, I would once again emphasise that we need to put an end quickly to the sometimes unfair practices found in the Member States. We cannot have a situation where, in many cases, qualifications are not recognised in order to keep wage costs low. This is clearly a problem of misalignment and is causing difficulties for immigrant job-seekers. This not only constitutes an infringement of the principle of equality, but also significantly restricts mobility within the workforce. The European Parliament needs to take a clear line on this in the forthcoming revision of the directive. I look forward to continued excellent cooperation. Jutta Steinruck  (S&amp;D

 Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, Nokia was exempted from paying tax in Romania for 30 years and only three years later is moving to Asia. Nokia received massive financial support for the construction of its plant in Bochum in Germany and then for its plant in Cluj in Romania. At the same time, the redundancies and the safeguards put in place for the employees were financed from public funds. I believe that it is dishonest to cite the crisis and production costs that are allegedly too high or, as has been mentioned today, environmental legislation as a justification for mass redundancies. Every employee at the plant in Cluj generates turnover of EUR 1 million each year and costs less than EUR 10 000 per year. We can no longer stand by and watch companies unscrupulously pocketing European money and then simply moving on like a plague of locusts. All the small agencies working on European projects have to sign contracts concerning the sustainability of their projects. Why does the same rule not apply to large companies? It is high time for us to introduce clear, tough regulations in this area. A voluntary approach and calls for compliance are completely useless. As long as companies like this exist, the European Globalisation Adjustment Fund, which is vitally important for workers in Europe, must not be called into question. We must help the people who are suffering. Jutta Steinruck  (S&amp;D

Madam President, ‘new skills and new jobs’ takes the form of guidelines for the Europe 2020 strategy and represents an important step towards increasing employment and growth. However, this must not mean that the labour markets are made more flexible unilaterally, without the involvement of unions and management, and, at the same time, that workers have little or no social protection. Flexicurity, a combination of security and flexibility, has so far only been used by the Member States as a magic word which will allow them to gradually increase flexibility and also to make working conditions more precarious. We do not want flexicurity under these circumstances. A cheap approach will not create jobs. We have established this during the discussion on the previous item. Therefore, I would like to emphasise once again that we are strongly opposed to the single open-ended contracts proposed by the Commission. From our perspective, offering contracts which will result in a lowering of social standards to young people who are starting work will not create one single job. Instead, it will play the different generations on the labour market off against one another. Labour market reforms must be negotiated with unions and management and must provide robust pension systems, training, employee rights and social security. We are very much opposed to interventions in the national systems for wage negotiations involving management and unions. I would like to thank everyone involved. I hope that tomorrow, we will adopt this positive report which would be further improved by the two amendments from the Group of the Progressive Alliance of Socialists and Democrats in the European Parliament.

 Public procurement not only needs to be made more flexible; it also needs to be made more sustainable. We must use the revision of the procurement directives as an opportunity for a change of strategy in favour of qualitative growth. We need to use public procurement to get rid of existing inequalities and to provide ecological incentives: it is a matter of good work on public contracts, adhering to collective agreements and maintaining and checking social and ecological standards. These requirements are more important than ever when faced with strict budgetary constraints. I am pleased that the report incorporates some of these demands, particularly the anchoring of social and ecological standards and the removal of the criterion of the cheapest offer. We need to maintain this line in the announced revision of the directives at the end of the year. We need to go even further, however: it is a matter of the protection of posted workers, compliance with working standards and collective pay agreements and good work. I hope that the Commission has noted the signal we have sent and will take it into consideration when making its proposals. Public procurement is not a market-based instrument for achieving the aims of the EU 2020 strategy, but rather needs to be used to develop the social and ecological aspects of the European project further.

Madam President, my question is directed at Mr Andor. A few weeks ago, Mr Andor, I visited a large building site in France along with other Members from my group to find out at first hand about how mobile European workers are being treated. Those employees in particular who were supplied by temporary employment agencies and who came from Poland, for example, were being subjected to appalling exploitation. Their working conditions were very poor. During this year alone, up to the time of our visit, three people had died in occupational accidents on the building site. The workers lived in dreadful conditions. Tax and social security contributions were deducted from their wages, but they had no right to health insurance. It was not clear where the taxes were actually going. This is just one of many examples of how the legal and also the illegal opportunities are being exploited. My questions are: What measures is the Commission planning to take to guarantee that the Posting of Workers Directive is implemented properly in the Member States? What proposals is the Commission making to prevent employees recruited through long chains of subcontractors from being exploited? Jutta Steinruck  (S&amp;D

Older women are discriminated against on two counts on the labour market: because of their gender on the one hand, and because of their age on the other. The consequence for women aged 65 and over is the prospect of a poverty-stricken old age. The increase in atypical, precarious employment, mostly involving women, is a growing problem in Europe. We must ensure that women aged between 55 and 64 remain in the labour market and are not sidelined. We must also to create the conditions that allow them to return to work. In the context of 2012 as the Year for Active Ageing, it is particularly important that the European Commission should redouble its efforts to improve the situation of older women and increase their participation in the labour market. Strengthening equality policy and increasing training opportunities are just two ways in which we can improve the situation of older women in the labour market in the long term. A good work-life balance is the key here. Different phases in life are associated with different demands on women in terms of family and professional commitments and should not be punished with pension reductions. Jutta Steinruck  (S&amp;D

 In its communication on social services of general interest the Commission already admitted last year that not all the Member States have the financial means to meet the growing demand for social services. In some countries there are, in fact, gaping holes in the social safety nets. It is important that we now fill these gaps. Mr De Rossa’s report is an important step in this direction, with the aim that social services may continue to facilitate social equality and social integration in the immediate future. The European Commission’s one-sided political concentration on the rules of the internal market is a big mistake. Budgetary consolidation at all costs is not the solution. The public sector has become the main target of all the austerity measures which are aimed at bringing budget deficits back into line following the rescue packages given to banks threatened with bankruptcy. The loss of public services will only increase the suffering of those who have been particularly hard hit by the current crisis in many Member States. I welcome the European Voluntary Quality Framework, which aims to ensure high quality even in difficult times. This is, moreover, a voluntary quality framework that includes the stakeholders in the process, and its principles support the quality systems of the Member States. I hope that the Commission will continue along the lines set out in Mr De Rossa’s report and its own communication from last year; in other words, that it will ‘fill the gaps’ rather than tearing open new holes.

 The subject of the management of spent fuel and radioactive waste is highly topical. Recent events in Japan have once again highlighted the immediate risks which affect workers and citizens who are exposed to radioactive material. We have many tonnes of radioactive waste in Europe which people have to move about. I am pleased that we can lay the foundations which will help to protect these people’s health throughout the whole of Europe. We have produced a report in Parliament which is based on the Commission’s technical report and which puts the focus on people, including employees of transport companies and plants which work with radioactive waste and employees at the final storage sites. Therefore, the members of the Committee on Employment and Social Affairs have focused on protecting the workers involved by putting in place safety measures, health protection measures and training for employees on the subject of radioactive waste. Economic interests must never be given a higher priority than the health of workers and citizens. Therefore, we need comprehensive documentation of all the waste and its management, while it remains harmful to people and the environment. I am pleased that so many of our requirements have been included in the final report by the Committee on Industry, Research and Energy. Jutta Steinruck  (S&amp;D

 I welcome the report on European cooperation in vocational education and training and would like to emphasise how important it is to promote lifelong learning through initiatives and Europe-wide programmes in order to make it possible for workers to have a better future. These days, workers are at the mercy of frequent and risky employment transitions. There are many types of transition: from training, redundancy, internships or precarious employment into full-time employment. The report contains some important points, including increasing the quota of women in work, recognition of informal learning and promotion of languages with the goal of providing mobility programmes. I am particularly pleased that the focus has been placed on education and training for young people, which is something that I will actively support in the flagship initiatives that follow. The transition from educational institution to working life must be as smooth as possible and, in particular, tailored to individual needs, because it must also be possible for young people with inadequate training to gain the skills necessary to be able to work in skilled jobs and to earn a good living. Social background must not determine a person’s educational opportunities. Young people must be given help and support in securing entry to the world of work. However, the cost of a modern labour market policy must not be borne by our workers. Jutta Steinruck,  
rapporteur for the opinion of the Committee on Employment and Social Affairs.

 Mr President, let us get back on topic. As rapporteur for the opinion of the Committee on Employment and Social Affairs, I would like to thank everyone who worked on this report. In the committee, all the groups pursued the unanimous objective of making education and training possible for every young person in Europe and supporting their entry into a career, while no young person should fall by the wayside. I did not base my opinion for the committee on the Commission report, as I found it too unspecific. It was important to me for very specific tasks, too, to be listed in the report. In some cases, I was unable to support the positions taken in the report. In the view of the Committee on Employment and Social Affairs, one important aspect is the transition from school to career. It is a core interface. This transition must take place without time spent waiting around. We also found it important that young people’s entry into their careers should not be associated with social dumping and that it must not take place under conditions of dumping. We felt that the role of traineeships was important. They are important and they are necessary, but their abuse must be avoided and forbidden. We would like to see an initiative for a European qualifications framework laying down minimum standards for traineeships. I will close with a request of Parliament and the Commission to ensure that the Youth in Action programme does not suffer financial cuts or even abolition in favour of the Youth on the Move programme. The work of youth associations is important for social engagement and helps young people progress, both in terms of substance and personally. That is also a major advantage for later working life.

 This report shone the spotlight on an occupational category that is all too often neglected. What would European culture be without creative artists? While developing the creative industries economically, we must not forget those who work in this sector. As the shadow rapporteur for my group in the Committee on Employment and Social Affairs, the social situation and the conditions in which creative artists in Europe live are particularly important. Unfortunately, many of the 5 million people who make their livelihoods from the creative sector live in precarious conditions. Second and third jobs are not rare, as one job is often not enough to live on. A lack of health and pension insurance is on the agenda. Contracts are mostly uncertain, and many creative workers are scarcely able to plan more than a couple of months in advance. Moreover, a fair level of social security protection, with adequate insurance against unemployment, sickness and for old age, must be standard practice also for those working in the creative sector. I am very pleased to see that the rapporteur followed the position of the Committee on Employment and Social Affairs in this regard and included it in the report. It is now time for the Commission and the Member States to remedy these social deficiencies and to promise the many creative minds of Europe that creative artists in Europe need not live as an underclass.

 Mr President, it is very significant that the Member who asked the question has left the room during the discussion. The arguments and questions put by some of the previous speakers once again demonstrate a highly revealing populist mindset. We are in the midst of a crisis and, as usual, savings are being made in areas which affect the workers. I think that this is a very one-sided approach. I would like to look briefly at the European Training Foundation (ETF). It is important because of its cooperation with the International Labour Organisation (ILO) in the EU’s partner countries. It enables the European social model to be exported to acceding countries and provides help with developing education, vocational training and further education programmes and with creating secure jobs. Two weeks ago, I was in Belgrade and, in meetings with education and training providers, I was once again assured of the importance of the agency. The same thing happened in meetings in Turkey. The ETF plays a very important role in helping the acceding countries to enter the EU labour market. If we take a more far-sighted approach, the Arab spring is also very important. We do not want large numbers of refugees to come to Europe, so we must offer people support in their home countries. We must provide education and help the countries to develop training programmes and facilities. Jutta Steinruck  (S&amp;D

 Mr President, Commissioner, I sometimes have the feeling that you should try out all these solutions on the Commission itself so that you could see what impact you are actually having on Europe. Following your speech, I am left with the impression that the Commission really does sit in an ivory tower. The people of Europe – the workers, the low earners and the pensioners – are really picking up the bill, and you are interpreting legislation and competences however you please. On 19 October last year, I received a response to a question that I had put to the Commission in which it was explicitly confirmed that minimum wages and wages in general are the responsibility of the Member States. The response states this very emphatically. Please read it. It is not acceptable for you to give me that kind of answer when it is a good thing for employers and then simply change direction when you believe something is good for the other side. That will make the people of Europe really very unhappy. My fellow Member has just mentioned this. You are chipping away at codetermination. You are weakening the trade unions. That is not the way out of the crisis and you are fully aware of that. Those who caused the crisis must also be the ones to pay for it. (Applause) Jutta Steinruck  (S&amp;D

As we discuss the report by Mrs Nedelcheva today, the 100th anniversary of International Women’s Day, it is high time for us finally to follow up our words with deeds. The disadvantage suffered by women in Europe can only be combated effectively if we introduce binding rules instead of voluntary commitments. These include mandatory women’s quotas on corporate boards, as well as all other levels, the consistent combating of precarious employment conditions, which affect women far more than men, the improvement of career prospects for women during education by systematically expanding the range of careers open to them, a ban on financial disadvantage to women in taxation and income, statutory equality plans in business and industry in order to promote women, and regular checks and reports on the progress achieved in Europe, if any. Let me conclude by saying this: After 100 years of International Women’s Day, we women will no longer be satisfied with simple lip-service. We want binding statutory regulations and we want final recognition that the work of women makes a decisive contribution to our prosperity. Jutta Steinruck  (S&amp;D

 Madam President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, the Europe 2020 Strategy is very important, not only for the development of European social and economic policy, but also for national social and economic policy. We must take care to ensure that this strategy is not misused at European level to pursue a social clearance policy in the Member States. I am extremely shocked that, in its Annual Growth Survey, the Commission is proposing pay cuts and a reduction in social protection. Some previous speakers have already talked about this. The impact on the people locally will be disastrous. It is unacceptable for the people, the workers, to bear the costs of budgetary consolidation alone. I, too, would like to appeal to the Member States to be guided only by the integrated guidelines when they draw up their national reform programmes, as these enable a much better balance between social protection and economic growth. The Annual Growth Survey once again mentions open-ended contracts, which were previously mentioned in the Agenda for New Skills for New Jobs. Mr Andor, we debated this once before in November 2010: young people cannot be integrated into the labour market by watering down employee rights. Experience in Europe has shown that this watering down simply results in a shift to precarious working conditions and does not create new jobs. We need specific measures in order to help those people who are most at risk and not flagship initiatives that operate alongside each other rather than being integrated with one another. Jutta Steinruck  (S&amp;D

 Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, pensions throughout Europe must provide enough money for people to live on. One important requirement is that people have decent jobs, because low paid jobs result in poverty in old age and inadequate pension provision. When I hear other Members of this House saying that people simply need to take out an additional private pension for their old age, I want to reply that many people can barely survive on what they earn, never mind paying for an additional private pension. This is why the first pillar of the pension system is of particular importance. The pay-as-you-go system based on the solidarity principle must form the foundation of European pensions and it must provide enough for people to live on. We cannot simply say that this is a matter for the Member States. We must send out a clear signal that we need pensions which give people enough money to have a reasonable quality of life. Mr Mann gave a detailed description of the German occupational pension system. I would like to mention it too, without going into the same level of detail. In my assessment of the Green Paper, I have come to the same conclusion, which is why we worked on the amendments together in committee. Therefore, I am calling on the Commission to ensure that, in everything which we do in future, the distinctive features of each country – the things that really work well and are essential for the survival of the pension systems in the Member States – are not disregarded. Jutta Steinruck  (S&amp;D

 Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, the free movement of workers, the freedom of establishment and the freedom to provide services are vital pillars of our internal market. Of course, these must not act as a gateway for social dumping. Service providers must respect the law of the State in which they operate. The country of destination principle must thus also be enforced consistently. For that to happen, all the Member States must also do their homework. My home country of Germany has not done its homework in this regard, as there is quite clearly a lack of framework conditions for fair mobility and social security. There are no binding wage floors in many areas, the monitoring of undeclared work is inadequate and we have fictive self-employment as a common way of circumventing labour law. As Mr Geier already said, we also need advice centres in different languages for posted workers, not just for companies. If the freedom to provide services is also to benefit workers, there is still some homework to be done. Jutta Steinruck  (S&amp;D

 Mr President, Mr Andor, Mrs Vassiliou, it is true that combating unemployment and the goal of full employment together represent one of our most urgent tasks. As Mrs Harkin said, the people of Europe do not want concepts; they want concrete solutions. I would like to thank you for your initiative. There are a lot of positive approaches here which two colleagues from my group have referred to. However, I believe that some improvements are needed, because more flexibility and more mobility will not create a single new job. I would like to endorse what Mrs Schroedter said in this respect. We need good, secure jobs in Europe and the Member States and businesses must ensure that these are permanent jobs which allow people to earn a good living. This must become a general rule once again and we must work towards this on a European level and choose the right course. In the agenda, you refer to new forms of employment contract with fewer rights for employees who are just starting their careers. You refer to these as open-ended contractual arrangements. In my view, this will not create any new jobs. Experience shows, and the Social Democratic government in Germany found this out a few years ago, that weakening employees’ rights will not result in any jobs being created. Measures of this kind simply turn secure jobs into precarious jobs. We must not allow this to happen in future. Jutta Steinruck  (S&amp;D

 Since the financial crisis of 2008, the G20 Heads of State or Government have been meeting regularly every six months to discuss economic and financial issues and to bolster cooperation in order to achieve stable and sustainable growth for the world economy for the benefit of all. However, I believe that, in order to find a sustainable and appropriate response to the financial, economic or social problems of the crisis, we need a broader-based approach and a more balanced perspective on these problems. The Finance Ministers of the Member States are not in a position to evaluate the situation on the labour market and to come up with answers to the pressing labour and social policy issues that give due consideration to the needs of workers or the people in general. I therefore call for regular meetings of the Ministers for Employment and Social Affairs in the G20. Moreover, I call on the EU and those Member States that are also members of the G20 to develop this idea further and to cooperate more closely with one another in the field of employment and social policy and to aim for a more balanced approach at summit level. We cannot allow competition to undermine the protection of workers’ rights. We need to enforce these rights, not only for the citizens of the European Union, but also for the citizens of other countries around the world. Jutta Steinruck  (S&amp;D

 Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, what I feel is missing from this debate is the necessary distinction between national transposition in the Member States and the task that exists at European level. We all realise that we need to take the special features of individual nations into account. However, where the debate in Germany is concerned, for example, I must say that I can definitely see how Germany could implement this report. What we are concerned with here is creating minimum standards at EU level to establish social framework conditions for women. We are always keen to make reference to the ILO when it comes to good work, protection at work and protecting health, so I ask myself: why not in this case? As far as the debate on costs is concerned, I would like to remind everyone in this House that in Germany – as well as in some other European countries – the anti-discrimination directive brought about a huge amount of lobbying on the part of enterprises. There was talk of an avalanche of costs, of companies going bankrupt, of burdens on the economy and on workers themselves. Looking back years later, how much of this happened? None of it. I find this debate, this lobbying, very reminiscent of that time. I urge you at last to put the economy on one side and to put people at the heart of what we do. I am not one of those merely sermonising here. I have stated that I advocate a social Europe. For me, that includes women. In this situation, women need our help. Jutta Steinruck  (S&amp;D

 The experience of countries where liberalisation has already taken place shows that liberalisation of postal services is a downward spiral. Competition must not be played out at the expense of workers, in other words on the basis of pay and working conditions. We must retain high quality jobs in the European postal service, because that is the only way that we will be able to guarantee the universal service for everyone. Postal services must be equally accessible to everyone, wherever they live – it must be a basic right. It is the Commission’s job to protect the citizens of the European Union from social dumping and to maintain labour standards. So far, however, nothing has been done. The opening up of European markets must not go hand in hand with the abolition of social protection rights. We reject the competition between the social systems of the Member States. I call for a moratorium until the social impact has been investigated, social conditions are secure throughout the postal market, the financing of the universal services is ensured and a way is found for competition to be based on quality and innovation in the market. Member States must provide legislative guarantees of the full accessibility of postal services. Jutta Steinruck  (S&amp;D

 Mr President, I would like to ask the Council to take note of our vote today and I would like to request a brief statement. Jutta Steinruck,

Madam President, I would like to begin my speech with a criticism of the procedure. Parliament’s work has been greatly impaired by the late tabling of this report. It was only really able to present its position because exceptions were made and the Council is not now going to debate this matter until the autumn summit. In the end, a workable compromise was found. The cooperation between the rapporteur and the shadow rapporteurs was excellent. That can also be seen by the fact that we received a clear majority for our position in committee. As Social Democrats, we were able to include very many of our key concerns, although we are not happy with every point. However, I am grateful for the assurance from the Belgian Presidency that it will support Parliament’s position. In order to facilitate this procedure, we have tabled four amendments, for which we request support in tomorrow’s vote. It was important to us that the guidelines for employment policies contain social components, in other words, a definition of good work, the stipulation that good work must also be well paid, and that testable interim goals are also laid down. However, the guidelines will only be taken seriously in the Member States if the Commission and the Council take them seriously. We therefore ask the Commission to ensure that appropriate measures are implemented and that the results are also examined. I am pleased that the Commissioner has assured us that our positions will be included, because Parliament has added a very socially-orientated and worker-friendly component which will benefit the people of Europe. That is also what people expect of this Parliament and this represents an improvement in social conditions. Jutta Steinruck  (S&amp;D

 Mr President, Mr Barroso, Mr Van Rompuy, it is important that we all work together to promote growth and employment and attempt to eliminate the causes of the crisis. However, our goal must be to learn from our previous mistakes and not to make those mistakes again. One subject which we must not lose sight of and which is particularly important to me is the fight against poverty. It is a pity that the European Heads of Government were not prepared to commit to implementing the Commission proposals on combating poverty as quickly as possible. The message sent out by the Council last week is that Europe does not care about the poorest people. The original goals have been watered down. All that remains are three key figures and the objective of lifting 20 million people out of poverty. That is not enough and it is clear that there is a real lack of political will in this respect. We had really hoped that the Commission proposal to reduce poverty by 25% would be adopted and taken forward, because poverty ultimately represents a risk for Europe. Jutta Steinruck  (S&amp;D
). 
 – (DE) 
Madam President, of course we need economic governance and, of course, the Member States must consolidate and restructure their budgets. However, what we are now seeing is a radical reduction in the social budget. Unemployment and poverty are increasing and people do not understand why banks and companies are receiving support while the politicians simply pay lip service to combating poverty and unemployment and put in place objectives that cannot be monitored. This is why the Europe 2020 strategy and the integrated guidelines are so important. We want to continue striving for the goal of full employment and we want proper work, not vulnerable jobs. When it comes to combating poverty, our goals really must be more ambitious. This is why we are calling on the Council to take up the Commission’s proposal to reduce poverty in Europe by 25%. The European Parliament has specific objectives and it is important for Parliament to be taken seriously. Jutta Steinruck  (S&amp;D
).

Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, I would like to appeal once more to the conservatives and liberals that we cannot here place the interests of the self-employed above the safety of the people of Europe. Entrepreneurial freedom is undoubtedly a very good thing, but the safety of our children and of everyone on the roads is more important – and that, to my mind, is the responsible way for Europe to act. Tomorrow’s vote is an opportunity to show that you are not in favour of social dumping. What this debate has also shown in recent months is that a debate on ostensible self-employment in Europe is long overdue. More and more regular employment relationships are being ousted by ostensible self-employment, which is why we urgently need the situation to be analysed and a proposal to be made for what we can do about it. As the Commissioner stated quite clearly today, we have had many declarations of intent on this matter. It is time to act at last. Jutta Steinruck  (S&amp;D
).  
– (DE)
 Mr President, Mr Mann, I hope you are in regular contact with your Chancellor, if you see things in the same way that I do. The EU 2020 strategy is a real opportunity to make Europe more social and we need that opportunity at this very moment when many hostile words are directed at Europe and when it has distanced itself from the people. We absolutely need to offer something positive to our citizens that will offset that situation. When it comes to growth and employment, we should stop putting people’s interests behind those of business. Indeed, that must be the key objective of the EU 2020 strategy because Europe needs social progress. I already pointed that out last Monday at the committee debate on employment policy guidelines: we must not lose sight of the goal of full employment, but we cannot have full employment at all costs because we need good jobs. We always say we need jobs, but what matters to me is that these jobs are good, that there is social security, that people do not have to receive subsidies and that they can actually make a living from these jobs. The ever more precarious nature of working life, the increasing income inequality and also growing poverty – which many speakers have talked about today – must finally be brought to an end with the EU 2020 strategy. We need a more active labour market policy and one which covers many areas. Finally, people expect more specific answers, very specific answers, in fact, and not an umpteenth strategy!

 Yesterday, the media told us that the Opel plant in Antwerp will close. This is just one of many examples of jobs being lost in Europe. Next Thursday, the European industrial trade unions will be holding a day of demonstrations throughout Europe. They are calling for jobs and the future of Europe as an industrial base to be safeguarded. The trade union members want full employment, but they also want effective European policies and definitive answers today, not in five years’ time. Your work programme does not provide very definitive information in this respect. You have just referred to the guidelines and the Europe 2020 position paper. In my view, this is not specific enough. You should provide examples. What do you plan to do to re-establish our strategically important industrial sectors in Europe and what role is the Commission playing in making the automotive industry future-proof and in safeguarding jobs? Jutta Steinruck  (S&amp;D
).  
– (DE)
 Commissioner Špidla, Madam President, the Commission should protect European interests and on that point I agree with what previous speakers have said. The Commission should reconsider its approach. From tomorrow, General Motors will be trying to rake in EUR 2.7 billion worth of public aid across Europe, without contributing a single cent of their own. We have to make it clear that Europe, i.e. the Commission, will not make any money available if that means that further plants will be shut down or that production will relocate outside Europe. However, at the same time, Member States should not support General Motor’s plans to that effect and should not think only about saving their own plants. We should not allow workers to be played off against one another, nor should Member States allow themselves to be so, because any such divisions would result in further off-shoring. The European taxpayer and Opel’s other workers in Europe should not foot that bill. Nobody will understand that over there! People want to understand what the European Union is doing. Whatever plans General Motors might have for Europe, the Commission should ensure that they play to European rules. The European Works Council has proposed a solidarity-based solution and a sound financial rescue plan for Opel, whereby all the plants would remain in Europe and whereby adjustments would be made in all plants on the basis of solidarity. Management should not be allowed to ignore this plan, nor should Mr Reilly and his colleagues disregard the consultation process with the European Works Council or the rights of consultation and participation which we have secured for European workers. A solidarity-based European solution for Opel is possible, but the Commission must get involved. Jutta Steinruck  (S&amp;D

 Madam President, I have a comment to make on what our fellow Member has said about there not being enough German MEPs attending this debate. Although I am a German Social Democrat, I share your criticism of the Minister of North Rhine-Westphalia, who is a member of the CDU, having said that he was pleased that it was the plant in Antwerp, rather than the one in Bochum, that was being closed down. We, the German Social Democrats, are in favour of a European solution, in other words, the plan put forward by the European Works Council. Let me say this very clearly once again: I have no idea why the German Conservatives and Liberals have shirked this debate. Jutta Steinruck  (S&amp;D
). 
 – (DE)
 Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, this is actually about finding a common European solution, rather than about national egotism. Opel Europe has a significant role to play in industrial policy in Europe and this is not only about jobs at Opel, but also about jobs in many automotive supply companies in a number of European countries. The decision in favour of Magna – and the European Works Council has confirmed this for me – achieved a consensus in the European Works Council, too, and its members are working flat out on European solutions. The workers are ready to make sacrifices for this cause, and we expect the same from all the decision makers. Everyone needs to work together, and to do so quickly. Previous speakers have already talked about this. In the interests of the workers, it also makes sense, of course, for thousands of jobs truly to be temporarily stabilised with State aid. We will not grant validity to any competition arguments that have been put forward. We are dealing with people and with jobs, but also with whole regions. The path that we were put on under Germany’s auspices must now lead to the best possible result for all European workers, across all European sites. Kerstin Westphal,

Madam President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen. I can only say that patience is its own reward. The report on type approval for Category L vehicles has turned out well in the end. The work took longer, overall, than we all thought it would – certainly longer than we hoped it would – and there were a lot more pitfalls along the way than we would have liked. However, I would like, at this point, to thank the rapporteur, Mr van de Camp, most warmly for his excellent cooperation. Together we achieved a lot in our talks with the Member States. As rapporteur for my group, I commend this report to the House – even though it could have been better. By better I mean safer. For us Social Democrats, the emphasis right from the start was on the safety of vehicles and thus the safety of their drivers, above all those driving scooters and motorcycles. The figures for motorcycle accidents have remained constant for years. Basically the number of fatal accidents is declining in Europe – apart from those involving motorcycles. Cutting the number of motorcycle and scooter fatalities is something I feel passionate about. Fewer deaths on Europe’s roads was and is my goal. Each death is one death too many. In a regulation that brings so much benefit to the internal market, this issue must be addressed with vigour. I remain convinced that this can be achieved through effective anti-lock braking systems (ABS). I am equally convinced that they are cost-effective. It just is not true that ABS is too expensive. Anyway, we have secured a mandatory requirement that manufacturers must, as of 2016, fit all new motorcycles of 125 cc and over, and from 2017 all existing motorcycles of that capacity, with ABS.  Motor scooters may be fitted, at the choice of the vehicle manufacturer, with ABS or a combined brake system. In this respect, it must be said, unfortunately, that we have not managed to improve on the Commission’s proposal. I would have liked to have achieved a lot more here, but the Commission and Member States were – I choose my words carefully – very slow to move forward on the whole business. However, we secured the promise of a Commission report in 2019. The report is to include road accident figures from the Member States and will consider the mandatory fitting of ABS to motor scooters. It will be forwarded to Parliament and the Council. On the basis of the report, the Commission will then decide whether or not to make the fitting of ABS to motor scooters mandatory. As you can see, this remains very much a work in progress. Thus we shall seek to close the loophole in the law in 2019. I am sure the figures we receive will vindicate me. I am convinced that this is indeed a good day for two-wheeler riders in Europe, and that we shall see a drop in the accident figures in future. Kerstin Westphal,  
rapporteur.

 Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, demographic change is one of the most important themes in our times. For example, we know that every second girl born in Germany today will live to see their 100th birthday. My 13-year-old daughter was happy when she heard this news. However politicians must naturally also respond to this fact, drawing conclusions and establishing general political conditions. My report, which will be the subject of a vote tomorrow, deals with some of these conclusions and the associated general conditions. It does not deal with social issues such as pensions. This is quite simply beyond the remit of the Committee on Regional Development. What it does consider, however, is the question of what European cohesion policy can do and how we can organise future cohesion policy in order to respond to the pressing issues. I would like to draw attention to four areas mentioned in the report. Firstly: we need to tailor European cohesion policy more closely than ever to demographic change. Demographic change continues to play quite an important role in the Europe 2020 strategy and in the legislative proposals. Now, as we come to implement the strategy, we must ensure that the topic remains on the agenda. The second area relates to infrastructure: we need infrastructure suitable to the needs of older people in order to avoid social exclusion. This includes accessibility to public buildings, for example. This move would also benefit other groups, such as families with small children or people with disabilities. At the same time, we need to make areas affected by emigration more attractive, particularly to young families. The third area relates to older people, children and families. More and more older people live in the various regions of Europe. Regional policy must respond to this fact. For me, this also means promoting so-called multi-generational housing, as well as European Regional Development Fund (ERDF) and European Social Fund (ESF) support in the social and health care sectors. Also, when it comes to the prevention of emigration, I believe that well-qualified full-time day care for children plays a very important role. It is a pity that the majority in the committee were not in favour of providing free child care. I would have liked to see much more courage here. The fourth area of concern is employment. Our prime concern here must be to combat unemployment among women and young people. We have a cohort of young women who are the best-educated generation in Europe of all time. If these women are denied employment opportunities, then we could be accused of being responsible ourselves for creating the shortage of specialist professionals. It is also important that we should make much more use of the knowledge and experience of older people. Appropriate structures must also be established for this purpose in the regions. I believe we all agree that we need to take an active approach by shaping demographic change rather than just managing it. European regional policy can make a huge contribution here. I would like to thank all the members of the committee who have worked on this report. This has been a long journey and several people have grown old and even retired while the work went on. The result has been worth the effort, however. I think we have produced a good report and I hope that the majority will vote in favour at tomorrow’s plenary. Kerstin Westphal  (S&amp;D

 Mr President, Mr Hahn, Mr Andor, ladies and gentlemen, I do not need to emphasise how important cohesion and regional policy is for the process of living together and growing together in Europe. However, I also believe that in future, regional policy and cohesion policy must focus more closely on our cities. Cities are an important driving force behind development in Europe. At the same time, they are currently suffering from environmental, economic and social problems. This is why I have a particular question for Mr Hahn. What opportunities do you think there are for highlighting the urban dimension? To come to the point, Mr Hahn, you recently indicated during an event which took place in this House that you had a specific percentage of the regional funding in mind which would be reserved for highlighting the urban dimension. Is this still the case? If so, what percentage were you thinking of? Kerstin Westphal  (S&amp;D
),  
in writing. 
– On behalf of the S&amp;D Group, I want to express our general consent to this report. It is important that the European Parliament fights for greater transparency in regional policy, but we reject the so-called ‘naming and shaming’, as asked for in point 16 of this report. We certainly agree to a tougher line on communication and information requirements, but the goal of more transparency – which we also support – should not be achieved by the wrong means. We are afraid of having a ‘witch-hunt’ when naming and shaming is carried out. The European Commission should not be made a moral authority which achieves group discipline by naming, shaming or blaming. We also reject this approach as it could lead to a more complex situation and non-implementation in the Member States. Despite this concern, we agree – as stated above – with the general ideas of the report and think it is very helpful. Kerstin Westphal  (S&amp;D
).

 Mr President, I would like to come back to the report by Mr Cortés Lastra, which I think is a very good report. Indeed, the Cohesion policy is actually the best instrument for mobilising investment in growth and employment. However, I would like to highlight again the importance of towns and cities here, because they will play a key role in achieving the objectives of the EU 2020 strategy. Four out of five Europeans live in urban areas. Towns and cities are the driving force of economic growth in Europe. At the same time, they are experiencing many problems particularly acutely. Key words here are social integration, the environment and transport, for example, but also demographic change. Therefore, towns and cities have a particular role when it comes to actually improving the living conditions of citizens. In addition, Europe’s towns and cities are key players in the fields of innovation, research and education, and therefore play a fundamental role in the implementation of the Lisbon Strategy and the EU 2020 strategy. All of this should be taken into account during the implementation of these strategies and during the shaping of the future course of the Cohesion policy. Knut Fleckenstein  (S&amp;D
).

Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, in this year’s enlargement strategy, the Commission has defined the key issues very accurately. Our rapporteur has reiterated them very effectively. It is about the credibility of our policies, honesty towards the EU’s citizens and the citizens of the candidate countries, and clarity on the criteria, which must be fulfilled prior to accession. We cannot pursue policies which bypass public opinion in the EU Member States. Public opinion in many countries is sceptical towards further rounds of enlargement. It is therefore the task of policy-makers – not only the task of the Commission but our task too – to bring clarity to the accession process and to explain it more effectively at home. Any country which successfully completes the accession negotiations will have progressed through a lengthy reform process and will have incorporated many of our legal provisions into its system of governance. An improved enlargement process does not mean offering a firm timetable but creating more clarity for the steps along the road towards accession. That is why we must send out a clear signal. Firstly, we want to keep the EU’s door open to the European countries because an enlarged EU offers all of us security, democracy and prosperity. Secondly, any country embarking on the road towards accession should be able to count on support from all of us. Thirdly, however, the pace of progress towards accession will ultimately depend on how quickly the accession criteria can be fulfilled and implemented. We know from experience that ‘rebates’ are not helpful here. Let me give some advice to my German colleagues in the House and at home: we Germans should not always act as if we were expecting to have to pick up the tab at the end of the process! We have profited to such an extent from previous enlargements that I feel sure that we can look forward to the next stage in a calm and confident manner! Knut Fleckenstein  (S&amp;D

Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, WTO membership can definitely support the urgently needed modernisation of the Russian economy, through easing technology transfer and improving investment security – these are just two examples. It is just two years since Russia agreed on a partnership for modernisation with the EU for the same reasons; the declared aims of this partnership include the alignment of technical standards, the extension of investment opportunities in key sectors for innovation and growth and the general strengthening of trade relations – all these are improved by WTO accession. However, successful accession to the WTO may perhaps merely give Russia more of a voice in other international bodies. Russia will only benefit from membership of it actually implements the joint agreement on trade facilitation. A partnership with the EU for modernisation only makes sense if Russia complies with its WTO obligations. Cherry picking, WTO à la carte – there are so many pleasing expressions for what we can to some extent still see Russia doing, what Russia is doing with its membership at the moment. The EU advocated for a long time that Russia should at last be a member of the World Trade Organisation and we will prove a reliable partner to our Russian friends in the future, but this relationship cannot function in one direction only. Even the joint project, which has already taken so long, i.e. the joint partnership agreement, can now be facilitated through the WTO accession on either side, since the rules no longer have to be negotiated – they are established. However – there are two conditions: the Russians must really comply, and the EU cannot pile on more conditions. Knut Fleckenstein  (S&amp;D
).

 Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I would like to highlight two points. You probably cannot tell this from looking at me, but I am not a fan of punk music. We are now all familiar with one punk group and that is Pussy Riot. I see the situation slightly differently from Baroness Ashton, but the subject of whether this was a civil protest or simply hooliganism which caused deep offence to other people is open to discussion. We can perhaps even discuss what the penalty for this sort of behaviour should be. We all agree that a two-year sentence is far too long. However, what should concern us and, most importantly, what should concern the Russians in their own country is the clear indication that this trial is once again an example of the political system exerting influence on the judicial system. That is totally unacceptable. My second point concerns the NGO act, which, as has already been said, has deliberately vague wording so that it can be interpreted as required. We need to set clear boundaries. The best thing to do would be to put this act where it belongs, in other words, in the rubbish bin. However, ladies and gentlemen, there is one thing you cannot say to me, which is that we must now evaluate everything we do together with Russia. I am firmly convinced, and we discussed this 10 days ago with our Russian colleagues in St Petersburg, that the only sensible way forward is to continue to talk to them and to Russian civil society, in order to get things moving. I am not one of those who believe that a discussion of resolutions by less than 3% of the Members of the European Parliament has better prospects for success. Knut Fleckenstein  (S&amp;D
),  
Blue-card question.
 – (DE)
 Mr Posselt, do you also believe that the clear language spoken by this Parliament has not been as successful as we might have hoped and, therefore, that we need both approaches? We need to work together and to develop projects together, but we must also make our opinions clear in the hope that there will be progress. My second question is this. Would you be of the same opinion, as a devout Catholic, if all of this had happened in the Vatican or in your church in Munich? For you, that would probably have been the equivalent of the collapse of Western civilisation. Knut Fleckenstein  (S&amp;D

 – (DE)
 Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, the talks between Belgrade and Priština here in Brussels were an initial success. I would like to say that this took a lot of courage on the part of Prime Minister Thaçi and President Tadić. We should recognise their courage because this is the first step in the right direction and a requirement for further positive developments. Now it is our job to show the people of Kosovo that we are serious. This is why we are supporting Ms Malmström in her commitment to visa liberalisation and why we are supporting you, Mr Füle, concerning the feasibility study for a Stabilisation and Association Agreement. You can rely on our solidarity, if you take action in this area. However, there is one thing that we should make clear, which applied in the past and will still apply in the future. Both sides must be aware that they can only make progress towards joining the EU together and in parallel. Neither side will be able to achieve this at the expense of the other. We will not tolerate that. Knut Fleckenstein  (S&amp;D
). 
 – (DE)
 Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I am convinced that the progress to greater democracy in Russia is no longer stoppable. I am also convinced, however, that our Parliament, our groups, the parties behind these groups and the foundations could, and must, do more to help Russia as good friends and advisors. Since the Duma elections, there have been numerous demonstrations and the involvement of civil society has increased dramatically. It is not only politicians who have taken to the streets; there are also many citizens, consisting increasingly of middle class, well-educated people and people who have educated themselves further through travel. We need to step up our dialogue and increase our contact with these people and ensure that there is more people-to-people contact, including by dealing swiftly with the outstanding issues relating to visa-free travel. However, we should step up our parliamentary dialogue now, too. I know that some people think less dialogue is the right response to the elections. I think that is wrong. We need more talks with our colleagues from the State Duma in order to discuss and to persuade and to offer them our experience. In so doing, we should present our views clearly so that our colleagues there can also learn from our experience and avoid the mistakes that we have made, and continue to make. We will best achieve this through clear dialogue and by showing as little as possible of the superior attitude that we sometimes see in this House. The Partnership for Modernisation is a good instrument for this purpose. We surely all agree that economic and technological modernisation is not sufficient and that without modernisation of the law, politics and society, Russia, and therefore our joint partnership, cannot succeed.

 Mr President, Baroness Ashton, ladies and gentlemen, the presidential elections in Russia on 4 March will show whether the government in Moscow has learnt its lesson. They will make it clear whether the processes have been improved and whether we can hold out hope that there will be positive developments in this area. However, the many demonstrations that have taken place since the beginning of December make me very hopeful. They are an indication that civil society is gaining strength and, therefore, for me they are also a sign of hope. At the same time, the large-scale demonstration due to take place on Saturday also highlights the problem faced by the Russian opposition and the protest movement. The so-called systemic opposition parties, which are represented in the Duma, are to a large extent not regarded by the population as being a viable democratic alternative. The inclusion of the nationalists in the protest movement is, thank goodness, giving rise to heated debate. I believe that we need to show solidarity in particular with those who have joined the White Ring protest over recent days and weeks. These citizens come from a wide range of different areas of society and are taking action to protect their civil rights, without having an ideological axe to grind and, most importantly, without any kind of self-interest. They do not want to form a government. Instead, they want the right to freely elect a government. This makes the movement even more convincing. What Russia most urgently needs are state institutions and elected officials who have democratic legitimacy and the trust of their voters and who make a clear commitment to serving the interests of the voters and to combating corruption and other abuses of power. Therefore, we must give this movement our support now and make it increasingly clear in our discussions with our Russian partners that we are happy to cooperate with them, but that we also want to see joint progress being made towards more democracy. Those of us who are members of the EU-Russia delegation will definitely be discussing this when we visit Moscow in eight weeks and it would be good if the Commission could play an active role in supporting the delegation. Knut Fleckenstein,  
rapporteur.

 Madam President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, I would like to start by offering my sincere thanks to the shadow rapporteurs for their very open, excellent collaboration. It was not too difficult in this case, as we are all convinced of the good and very efficient work that the European Maritime Safety Agency (EMSA) has done in the last few years. There quickly emerged a relatively homogeneous picture of what we envisage the future work of this agency to be. We also all agreed that any kind of extension of competences must either have European added value or generate clear synergy effects in the Member States. Allow me to mention just a few aspects. On 20 April 2010, we experienced the worst oil disaster in human history in the Gulf of Mexico. On 10 August 2011, there was the oil spill at the Gannet Alpha platform in the North Sea. The report on oil pollution by the Oslo-Paris Commission reveals that, in 2008, there were more than 500 oil spills at oil and gas platforms in the North Sea. It was therefore right for the Directorate-General for Energy to table a legislative package in this regard to improve the regulation of oil platforms. This includes an independent third party who is to monitor the safety of the oil platforms. Together, we should open the door for EMSA here. What European body could perform this supervisory role better? I know that EMSA does not currently have the relevant expertise. However, that is a weak argument. There are large overlaps with the areas in which EMSA currently works, and it is considerably more efficient these days to extend the available resources rather than to create entirely new ones. If the Member States now say that they are prepared to extend EMSA’s mandate and state that EMSA is now not only responsible for shipping accidents, but is also to perform the clear up following oil spills caused by drilling rigs, this will perhaps reveal a modicum of common sense, but it will certainly not be a major breakthrough. The European Parliament must focus on preventive measures. Merely cleaning up after the event is not enough. Commissioner Oettinger said that numerous facts about accidents confirm that prevention is better than trying to put things right afterwards. This statement is perhaps not particularly helpful, but it is right nevertheless. I would like to address two more points that also seem to me to be important. We need European maritime transport without borders. We have already had many debates on this subject, but there is still too little being done and too slowly for us to achieve this objective. With the help of EMSA and its recording capabilities, we can also make progress in this area. My next point is that we all know how important it is to support maritime occupations in the European Union. We cannot and do not under any circumstances want to win the competition for the lowest personnel costs and the reduction of social standards. However, when it comes to the quality of the training and further training of the seafarers, then we can play a leading role, and EMSA can and must contribute its knowledge and expertise in this regard. In committee, the report received the support of a large majority. It is intended to make it clear that Parliament takes its proposals seriously. I am confident as regards the negotiations with the Council. However, this presupposes a serious readiness to negotiate. That is what I am asking for. Knut Fleckenstein,  
rapporteur.
 – (DE)
 Madam President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, I would just like to thank those involved once again for their cooperation and also those who have just spoken for their contributions to the debate. There are naturally a few things that have not received adequate mention in our debate, as there has not been enough time – apprehending environmental polluters for example, and you mentioned piracy. I would just like to make one thing clear once again, Mr van Dalen. This report does not call for a European coastguard. We are, however, asking to finally receive the expert opinion that we want – as decided by this Parliament a long time ago – on how this coastguard should be structured and what advantages and disadvantages it would have. Mr Gallagher mentioned that EMSA saves the Member States a lot of money. That is correct. Now the issue of a coastguard could be seen as an example of the fact that we will only really have these synergy effects if we do not merely set something up jointly but if, back in our Member States, we also remember what was decided in Brussels and reduce the national structures accordingly. Only then will we see the synergy effects. Where one or two transport ministers are concerned, I have the impression that they join in the decision-making process in Brussels but then forget to tell anyone back home that adjustments need to be made as a result. I am a German MEP so I know what I am talking about. Of course, we could not regulate everything. The gender issue is something we are taking seriously. Nevertheless, it is obviously difficult to regulate the gender issue in a satisfactory way in bodies to which 27 Member States each send one person. As regards competences – whether national or regional – we sometimes had the feeling in committee that this was a Spanish domestic discussion. It is all the same to me whether it is national or regional. The authorities must be the competent authorities, and that is what will make them the right points of contact. How the competence is determined is up to others at a local level. My final point is that EMSA contains an ‘S’ for ‘safety’, you are absolutely right about that. However, Ms Foster, if you believe that as far as oil platforms are concerned, there are particularly good regulations in place, then I would remind you once again of what I said earlier: 500 accidents on oil and gas drilling rigs in 2008 show that we really need to consider how we can improve this situation and perhaps also integrate this within an agency that already deals with similar problems. Knut Fleckenstein  (S&amp;D

 Madam President, Baroness Ashton, I can only endorse what Ms Oomen-Ruijten has said about the elections. We very much want to make it clear to the Russian President that his announcements must be followed by actions and that we will take him exactly at his word. I think that what Mr Swoboda has said is right. We should hold a major hearing for everyone involved, once the OSCE Office for Democratic Institutions and Human Rights (ODIHR) has submitted its report. Therefore, I think it is wrong to call for new elections now, before the report is available. I would just like to say one thing to Mr Kelam, but unfortunately he is no longer here. Perhaps it is simply an error in the interpreting. He said that the demonstrators in Moscow represent an opportunity for us. I do not believe that this is right. It is not an opportunity for us, but an opportunity for the people of Russia. We need to be careful about what we say. Elections will be an important topic of conversation at the summit, but this can also be a summit which gives confidence. There are two positive points which I would like to mention briefly. One is accession to the World Trade Organisation (WTO) after 18 years of negotiations. This not only clarifies the rules, but could also make a new agreement with us easier, hopefully in future prevent the unilateral trade restrictions that there have been in the past, and alleviate the repeated pressure caused by the Siberian overflight rights. The second and final point that I want to touch on briefly is the question of visas and free movement. We are pleased that a regulation will be put in place on the border traffic to and from Kaliningrad. That will really make the situation easier for people in Poland and in Kaliningrad in particular. The joint steps which the two countries aim to agree on and which have been carefully prepared will hopefully, with good will on both sides, lead to a regulation on visa-free travel at some point. We will be discussing modernisation, human rights and the development of a civil society and we want to achieve sensible, positive results. However, without personal contacts, none of this will succeed. Knut Fleckenstein,  
on behalf of the S&amp;D Group.

 Mr President, Baroness Ashton, ladies and gentlemen, I shall be brief, because the subject of Russia comes round every four weeks and I stand by the opinion that I expressed four weeks ago. Yes, we regret the fact that yet again, parties in Russia, most recently the liberal party, are not approved and therefore cannot stand for public election. I am convinced that no nation in the world will put up with this in the long term. I am also convinced that our Partnership for Modernisation could be implemented much more effectively if the Russian Government could allay concerns about democratic shortcomings and the rule of law with bold decisions. Until such time as that happens, we shall not let this subject rest, also because we believe that it is in the interest of our partner, in other words, Russia itself. For my part, I should also like to add that I am equally convinced that we can achieve a great deal more by stepping up our talks and our cooperation than by adopting monthly resolutions, however appropriate these may be. Human rights and democracy are indivisible. Our public contribution to this is important, our criticism of Russia is justified, but we would be even more credible if we were to identify the shortcomings within the EU with the same honesty and acuity and perhaps even more unanimously than before. As long as Members of this House maintain – as they did yesterday – that modern Hungary is a model democracy, then, what my fellow Member from the European People’s Party (Christian Democrats) said continues to apply: that the self-righteousness of some Members of this House is hair-raising. I agree with that. I am not saying this to please anyone in Moscow, but because I am firmly convinced that we can make a much more effective contribution than we are making at present. (The speaker agreed to take a blue-card question under Rule 149(8)) Knut Fleckenstein  (S&amp;D

 Mr Migalski, you are absolutely right. The two things cannot be compared. However, I believe that you enhance your credibility by dealing with the problems in your own backyard – quite irrespective of any criticism, including of Moscow. My second point is that, while we are perfectly entitled to criticise Moscow, the question must be how we can most effectively help bring about some kind of change. I am convinced that that will not be achieved through repeated resolutions. Knut Fleckenstein  (S&amp;D
). 
 – (DE)
 Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I would just like to mention two points because Mr Swoboda has already mentioned a number of points on behalf of our group. Russia is indeed at an important crossroads. Its internal political situation will be determined by the elections to the Duma in December and the question of who will continue the modernisation embarked upon as president from 2012. One can also put a positive slant on this. There could be no better opportunity to strengthen international confidence in Russia’s development. This is conditional upon there being fair elections, fair opportunities for registration and access to the media for the candidates, to ensure at least an element of equal opportunity. My second point concerns the Partnership for Modernisation between the EU and Russia. This opens up new opportunities for effective cooperation. We should therefore not miss the opportunity to support Russia vigorously in this modernisation – not just by investing in the modernisation of the economy, but also in its society. Governments put things down on paper and, as we all know, you can say what you like on paper. Citizens, however, become very restless if what is stated on paper is not implemented. Civil participation and the involvement of civil society, entrepreneurs, researchers, young people and artists are essential to a self-determined society of solidarity. We can only successfully support such modernisation, however, if people can come together easily in order to learn from each other and exchange experiences. For these reasons, the EU and Russia should finally reach agreement on the common steps that need to be taken to achieve visa-free travel and how these can be implemented, in order to achieve results as quickly as possible. We have been talking about people in the Kaliningrad region and thinking about facilitation. A month ago, this House decided that visa facilitation should be allowed for cultural purposes. We have been talking about whether perhaps particular consideration should be given to young people here. These are all good suggestions to get the ball rolling, but they are no substitute for an overall solution. I would therefore urge the Commission to step up the pace. You can count on our support in any case, including as regards some of the more hesitant certain Member States. (Applause) Knut Fleckenstein  (S&amp;D

 Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, through its report on the cultural dimensions of the EU’s external actions, Parliament clarifies its aspiration to also put our own stamps on this developing policy field. The fact – and I want to put this carefully – that I do not see a representative of the External Action Service here today shows how necessary this report is. The report quite rightly urges that, in future, cultural aspects should play a more significant role in external policy, into which they should be more systematically incorporated. For my group, it was important to call for a coherent strategy that more effectively coordinates existing EU external policy programmes with cultural components, thereby taking account of cultural diversity in the EU. Mrs Pack has already made reference to this, saying that the existing structures in the Member States and between them, such as the EUNIC network of national institutes for culture, must be incorporated and that civil society must be seen as part of European external cultural policy. The EU’s motto of ‘United in diversity’ should also come to bear on the image that the Union projects to the outside world. We should also make even better use of the new media as a communications platform to that end. As we do all this, we need to make sure that art and culture do not become means to an end in external policy. It is our cultural values that characterise our European Community. It is therefore important and right that this cultural diversity and identity should also be disseminated outside the Union by its policies. I feel sure that we can achieve much more in this way, including in the debate about human rights and democracy, than through many cases of sabre-rattling, sometimes with absolutely nothing to back it up, in this House. Knut Fleckenstein  (S&amp;D
). 
 – (DE)
 Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I regret the fact that this debate was put on the agenda at such short notice that the High Representative for Foreign Affairs and Security Policy was not able to be here. In recent months, Baroness Ashton has worked with the Council to improve internal EU coordination on cooperation with our strategic partners, including Russia. With regard to her efforts to achieve a coordinated position, I think it would have been sensible to involve her in this debate. None of the other strategic partners of the EU is as close to us as Russia, either geographically or in relation to our historic experiences. This is why we take great interest in the internal political developments in Russia. At this point, I would like to make specific mention of the work programme drawn up jointly by the coordinators of the Partnership for Modernisation, both in Russia and in the EU. This joint work programme for modernisation contains important measures which will provide active support for the development of the rule of law in Russia. This is the right way of ensuring that our partnership brings real benefits, in particular, for the citizens. The initiative to modernise Russia launched by the Russian President gives the country’s international partners the opportunity to begin a fruitful cooperation with Russia. We must make use of this opportunity. As my fellow Members have already said, if the modernisation process is to be sustainable, it must not only be based on technological developments. A modern Russian economy must be founded on the reliable principles of the rule of law. Only when citizens and business people can rely on the rule of law will they have the courage to introduce innovations and make investments. Let us take the hand that Russia has reached out to us and help the country to modernise. Knut Fleckenstein  (S&amp;D

 – (DE)
 Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I would simply like to make three brief points, on behalf also of some of my colleagues on the Committee on Transport and Tourism. These are critical points that I would ask the representatives of the Commission to bring up in their discussions. The first is that although it has already been passed, the travel promotion tax is an unacceptable unilateral decision by the US Government. We hope that you can persuade it to think again on this. Secondly, the exclusion of Romania, Poland, Bulgaria and Cyprus from the visa waiver programme is something that the European Parliament cannot endorse, and, in our opinion, it should not be allowed to continue. Thirdly, we welcome the joint efforts to elaborate international security standards and to develop smart security concepts, but unilateral stipulations such as compulsory container scanning are not a solution because they are one-sided and disproportionate. The costs are out of all proportion to the benefit and it is unreasonable to expect this of European ports and enterprises. Knut Fleckenstein,  
on behalf of the S&amp;D Group

 Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, firstly I would like to congratulate Mrs Meissner on her report and thank her for all her hard work. We share the approach taken by this report which puts the focus not on the sectoral structure of maritime policy in the individual Member States, but instead emphasises the importance of coordinating maritime policy within and across the Member States. If we look to the future, we will see the space available in our seas and oceans becoming more restricted. The oceans are transport routes, sources of raw materials and energy, suppliers of foodstuffs and water reservoirs. The economic exploitation of the oceans is growing and this brings an accompanying increase in the environmental impact on them. Conflicts of interest will arise and we will have to resolve them by means of effective coordination within and among countries. It is not possible to comment on every issue, but I would like to mention briefly the sulphur emission control areas. It was not my intention to make the limits less strict. When the Commission presents its study, we will be able to tell to what extent the limits will result in a shift from sea to road transport, in particular in the North Sea and the Baltic. Then we can discuss this issue further. However, the basic conditions for competition within the European Union between the North and the South must remain at the same level. This must also be one of the Commission’s objectives. There is one point which we are not entirely happy about. We have been talking for a long time about the strategic importance of the shipbuilding industry in Europe. We have also said that innovation is very important in this industry, because this is the only way that it can survive. We need a coordinated strategy for our policy on the shipbuilding industry. I believe that the call from the Member States to put funding aside for shipbuilding was also very important, but it has not been supported by the Liberals and the Conservatives. Ladies and gentlemen, how do you propose that we should support the shipbuilding industry in Europe? Coming out with platitudes and good wishes for the workers in the European shipyards, who are concerned about their jobs, is simply not enough. We Social Democrats expect better measures and better proposals in this area. Knut Fleckenstein  (S&amp;D
).

 Mr President, I would just like to interrupt the debate very briefly to inform you and my fellow Members that last night, three terrorists stormed the Chechen Parliament, killing several security officers and taking hostages. The terrorists were also killed. Parliament ought to express its condemnation of this act of terrorism in no uncertain terms, because terrorism can never be justified. Our sympathy goes out to the families. I wanted to mention this briefly, especially in view of the fact that we will be discussing the Northern Caucasus again this week. I apologise for the interruption. Knut Fleckenstein  (S&amp;D
). 
 – (DE)
 Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I am pleased that we will be able to adopt this report with a large majority tomorrow. There are two things that I regard as being particularly important. The first is ensuring that the objectives we have set ourselves for 2020 can be measured. We need measurable principles which will allow us to take stock after ten years or, even better, halfway through the period, so that we can identify whether we have achieved some of what we set out to do or whether things have not worked out and we need to make improvements. This applies in particular to CO2
 emissions in the transport sector. If all the other sectors are making good progress, as Mr Cramer has said, then we can rightly call on the transport industry to do the same. European transport policy is of particular importance when it comes to reducing CO2
 emissions. The second point concerns the implementation of efficient comodality. For me, this is the key to a sensible EU transport strategy. I say this, because efficient comodality can have a number of different meanings. If we do not base this theoretical concept on the right criteria, which can be put into practice, we will not achieve our objective. Therefore, I am once again calling on the Commission to ensure that the concept is implemented correctly down to the last detail, which means developing useful intermodal nodes and removing the bottlenecks in the transport of goods to and from important European trade gateways. This particularly applies to the links between major ports and airports and their hinterlands. My third point is that the proposed core Trans-European Network (TEN) must be based on the same criteria, so that there is an almost automatic modal shift towards an efficient and environmentally friendly European transport system. These are the factors that make up a sensible plan. Not just cost effectiveness, but also social compatibility, environmental protection and sustainability. Mr Grosch and Mrs Alvarez, thank you very much for all your hard work. Knut Fleckenstein  (S&amp;D
). 
 – (DE)
 Madam President, Baroness Ashton, ladies and gentlemen, the EU-Russia Summit has produced reasonable results, in particular, as far as specifying the details of the Partnership for Modernisation is concerned. I very much welcome the fact that dialogue between the civil societies has been seen as a priority in this partnership. As the chair of the European Parliament delegation for relations with Russia, I led a working group meeting in Perm a few days ago specifically on the subject of developing the civil society. We have once again seen how much progress has been made in Russia in recent years, but also how much still remains to be done and how much we can contribute to the discussions on the basis of our experiences, both good and otherwise. Exchange and movement are key concepts for me. There can be no Partnership for Modernisation without the movement of people. For this reason, I am rather disappointed that the EU has not really made much progress in the area of travel without visas. We must now set specific objectives which the EU and Russia can work together to achieve. This is not about meeting schedules and certainly not about following certain sequences of events. It is all about ensuring that we take a predictable approach to these issues, that the criteria are clearly defined and that everyone, including Russia, can be sure that when these conditions are fulfilled and when the specific problems are solved, visa liberalisation will be possible. Knut Fleckenstein,  
on behalf of the S&amp;D Group.

 Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, first of all, we very much welcome the fact that, in future, we will have a maritime strategy in the EU, even if we will have to wait a little longer for the vote. We assume that this report will be incorporated into the Future of Transport report and then into the White Paper. Through the European Maritime Transport Strategy 2018, we are creating the framework to make the European maritime economy more competitive at international level, and in this strategy we have determined, firstly, that we want this framework to be set up on the basis of ecological standards and, secondly, that we want sensible global social standards for high quality shipping. Let me briefly address three points. Firstly, shipping is an environmentally friendly transport sector and therefore, one of our aims was for this branch of the economy to play its part in combating climate change in future, too. I am very much in favour of us creating incentives like the green ports, even if we do not make any decisions today but rather assign the Commission and the Council the task of finding out what is possible in this regard. I believe it is just as important to maintain international competitiveness – including in respect of other modes of transport. It is therefore also right for the Commission, on the basis of our proposal, to once again carry out an impact assessment in respect of the sulphur emission control areas in the North Sea and the Baltic Sea because, if we want higher requirements here than elsewhere, we need to take international competition into account and ensure that, if possible, we do not cause the transport of containers to move back to the roads, which would be counterproductive. Allow me to mention one last thing that I feel is particularly important, namely the inclusion of the major European ports in the planning of the TEN networks. This is of such enormous importance to us because the ports are important intersections in the transport chains and they can only perform their role effectively if intermodality is facilitated and reinforced. There are numerous other points that I could mention here. Mr van Dalen, congratulations on this excellent report. We have all contributed a little to it and I would ask for your understanding for the fact that we do not want to spoil this excellent report by accepting your amendments. Knut Fleckenstein  (S&amp;D

 – (DE)
 Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, the previous speakers have already clearly highlighted many points and problems, such as the human rights situation. It is important for us to make these points clearly, as only then will we be able to have an open and frank debate. If Russia is currently once again seriously discussing introducing the death penalty according to the US model, we cannot neglect to express our opinion on this. I have two brief points to make. My first point relates to Russia’s accession to the WTO and my sincere request, including to the Council and the Commission, is to provide as much support as possible for this. Of course, Russia must play its part, too, but we are both relying on this and it would be good for both of us if developments in this regard were to move in a positive direction. The fact that Russia wants to join the WTO and not just enter into a customs union with Belarus and Kazakhstan is a step in the right direction. My second point is a sincere request for us not to lose sight of the development of our cooperation in the areas of science and research as well as in the area of civil society. We need a new impetus for cultural exchange as well as youth exchanges, not only in one direction, as Mr Gahler said, but in both directions. Every young person who takes part in this will develop an understanding for others and will become a messenger for a more positive development of our relations. I hope that we will talk more about these common interests and that these aspects will also assume greater importance. Matthias Groote,  
rapporteur.

Mr President, Commissioner, President-in-Office of the Council, ladies and gentlemen, it is a well-established and fine tradition that we adopt a joint resolution in advance of climate conferences and prepare the delegation. Yesterday, we held a final meeting which was attended by the Commissioner and also the President of this House. My colleagues with experience in these matters tell me this was a first! With his contribution, the President sent out a strong signal that the full backing of the House is ensured and that we are taking on an important role in relation to COP 18, in that we will be holding discussions with as many international representatives as possible there and will also exercising our powers of persuasion. That really is essential. We hope that after tomorrow, we will be able to take with us a strong resolution that offers clear solutions. We have a duty to provide answers, for climate change can only be combated and halted through international cooperation. The conference in Doha will take place from 26 November to 7 December, and I am keen to see which positions China will adopt and which positions the US will adopt now that the President has been returned to office for a second term. How will they position themselves, and how will we then respond to the issues raised, and so on?  We have just held an interesting debate about Europe’s financial future. This debate is relevant to us in Doha as well, for as is well-known, friendship stops where money begins. Where climate change is concerned, however, friendship begins in earnest. We must find answers to the question of how the fast-start period will continue to be financed after 2012. A great deal of money will be required here. However, it is important to emphasise, as always, that the deceptive aspect of climate change is that its effects are not felt immediately. Even if we were to adopt a decision tomorrow that CO2
 emissions will be reduced by 50 % immediately, the effects would not be felt until very much later. Climate change and the financial crisis therefore have one feature in common: they will both cost a great deal of money.  If we continue to prevaricate, also in the international arena, and do not manage to find a workable way forward in Doha, this will prove very costly for the international community and is likely to have extremely adverse effects for a great many people. It may even cost lives. Failure, therefore, is not an option. However, we should not demand too much, that much is clear. At previous conferences, we learned that we have to take small steps. However, the largest step that the industrialised nations must take is to deal with the future financing and safeguards for adaptation measures and climate action. Clearly, we remain committed to the 2° target. However, with a ‘business as usual’ approach, 3.5° or 4° is the more likely outcome, and no expert in the world can tell us the exact number of degrees at which we cause irreparable damage to the planet.  I am most grateful to the Commissioner. Last week, we held a lengthy debate on how we wish to proceed internally with our emissions trading scheme. However, there is movement at the international level as well, and this applies to various sectors. I welcome the fact that we appear to be on track, here in the EP, towards a solution for aviation, which I hope will be achieved as quickly as possible, ideally before the conference. However, aviation is an international business, and if there is the possibility of achieving a global agreement here, we should stop the clock, as the Commissioner has rightly pointed out, but of course only for a short time. In that case, it is essential to ensure that the international negotiations produce a genuinely workable arrangement, with a workable decision being taken by the International Civil Aviation Organisation (ICAO), resulting in an international agreement. Otherwise, the clocks will start ticking again in autumn next year and the legislation will proceed. I would also like to respond to the fellow Members who described this as ‘giving way’. Let me say this: ‘giving way’ looks very different. I believe this was a wise decision which this House should support. I believe it sends out a signal for the debates in Doha and shows, once again, that we are willing to compromise here. A further important point relates to climate diplomacy, which the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Food Safety included in the resolution. This means that we are following this issue at all levels, including the European External Action Service (EEAS), and it is always a topic of discussion at all the international meetings. The parliamentary delegation is very well prepared. I very much hope that everyone, including the Commission, will ensure that the parliamentary delegation is fully involved in all the daily briefings so that we have a lively exchange. Our role in Doha will be to convince as many people as possible in positions of responsibility outside the European Union that our ideas are the right ones, and advocate for a global agreement, so that a second commitment period can begin. That is crucial in order to combat climate change and achieve successes. Matthias Groote  (S&amp;D

Mr President, the timing of today’s session leaves something to be desired. I have never experienced us being over an hour late before. In this regard, blue cards should indeed be used freely, but should also not be misused.  With regard to fracking, the debate reminds me a little of that relating to nuclear power – yes or no. I must say, however, that just because something is technically possible, that does not mean it has to be done. The protection of health and the environment must therefore take absolute priority over any immature technologies, and that is what I see when it comes to fracking. My greatest reservations concern the impact on the environment. What we are lacking is a sensible regulatory framework. We have various policy areas: Member States are responsible for the energy mix, but we are responsible for environmental policy. We have gaps in the water framework legislation. We have no mining law. I believe it is appropriate and timely for the Commission to think about how we can close these gaps, to create legal certainty and to ensure maximum protection for health and the environment. This – as I see it, anyway – is not the case with regard to fracking! A potential energy supply of the future cannot, however, be created at the cost of the environment or health. Furthermore, if you look at how many accidents and risks there are in the United States with the 50 000 existing well-bores, I must say that we should give careful consideration to how we get involved in this technology and what the protective framework for this future technology should be. Matthias Groote  (S&amp;D

Mr President, last Wednesday, the Nordseewerke shipyard in Emden had to file for bankruptcy because, to its surprise, a guarantee by the Lower Saxon Land Government was not extended. That undertaking, with 700 skilled jobs, is in the process of transforming from a shipyard to a supplier of offshore wind energy. And it is now thought that this undertaking can be saved by a large loan and that the jobs can also be saved, for the 700 SIAG and Nordseewerke workers have already had to accept substantial cuts in their pay. That is why I ask the Commission to take a favourable and also an early look at this procedure, to ensure that these 700 jobs are not put at risk, because they are needed in order to organise the energy revolution and sustainable energy on the seas of Europe. Please do not let the workers there suffer from the Land government’s poor crisis management. Matthias Groote  (S&amp;D

 Mr President, air quality is an important topic in the European Union, particularly in the coming year, which is the Year of Air. We should take heed of this and work to ensure that progress is made in this area. However, we also have to take into account the fact that maritime transport is currently facing one of its most severe crises. I have major concerns regarding the technology that is to be used to provide clean air. In this area, we must make sure – and that includes in the financial perspective – that alternatives are pointed out. As my fellow Member has just said, LNG is a very good alternative in the Sulphur Emission Control Areas (SECAs). However, for this we need research and development. It is also an economic recovery plan for our shipyards, particularly in the case of scrubber technology, which has not got that far yet. I sometimes get the feeling that some of my fellow Members believe that the required technology is just sitting on the shelf waiting to be used. It is not. I would therefore like to see greater focus on promoting technology, so that we really can have clean air in our ports and port cities. Please would you also pay heed to who foots the bill at the end of the day. Matthias Groote  (S&amp;D

 Mr President, the best kind of energy is energy that is not used in the first place. We are not talking here about saving energy, but about using energy more efficiently. There is one aspect of this where I would like us to have gone further, and that is in the public sector. There is huge potential here, a huge backlog of investments among our local authorities. I would have liked to have seen Parliament being more ambitious in this regard. We have pushed through this procedure, partly unnecessarily. One Member – one of the shadow rapporteurs – has mentioned it already; I even thought he wanted to vote against the whole compromise. If it is all so terrible, why did he then not push for a second reading? I would have liked the community to take such an important matter to second reading, so that the whole package could be discussed with the chambers and guilds. Greater transparency in this area would really have done us good. That is what I would like to see happen next time. The rapporteurs have made their decision, but I would like to remind Members that two readings are actually the rule in this House. In this parliamentary term, it has become the exception. We should take that to heart and think about it sometime. Matthias Groote  (S&amp;D

 Mr President, we debated the preparations for the Rio+20 conference intensively in our respective bodies within the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Food Safety. It must be said however, that, in the final analysis, the result achieved in Rio is fairly unimpressive. Mr Prodi expressed our disappointment in a nutshell, calling it Rio minus 20! Some NGOs described the result the same way. What has been achieved in the conference is really very little indeed. Firstly, we need to consider whether there is much point holding conferences in this format. We have been through Copenhagen, which was a disaster, and now we have had Rio+20: we are moving from one disappointment to the next. I think that the upgrading of the UN Environment Programme, putting it on an almost equal footing with the WHO, is the right approach, as it will give this organisation more authority and more enforcement powers than was previously the case. This is a very important point. We are going to witness the world’s population grow to 9 billion. We are heading for a catastrophe if things keep going like this. If more and more people live in industrialised nations and want access to energy and if we do not take radical steps to avert this, we shall encounter enormous problems. That is why we need a new development strategy. There has been no public debate on this issue, even in advance of Rio. When I consider what we voted on yesterday – ACTA – and the number of e-mails and letters, etc. we received on this issue, then I believe that we also need to move towards a sustainable planet in the digital community too. After all, this world is the only one we have got. We can play our part here by changing our strategy and bringing more people along with us, and then perhaps the Angela Merkels of this world will travel to the next summit and really put their heads together to produce concrete results. Matthias Groote  (S&amp;D

Mr President, I would also like to express my sincere thanks to the shadow rapporteurs and the rapporteur. This report was adopted by the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Food Safety with an absolute majority of 62 votes in favour, no votes against and no abstentions. This shows that we are actually very much at one with regard to the compromises. Of course, we must give the greatest priority in this legislative process to the provision of high level consumer protection for the younger members of society, in other words children, who need special consideration. Gluten intolerance is a problem, particularly in nurseries. If we look around us – I myself have two children in this age group – we will be aware of the allergies and intolerances that arise, which is why I believe that we have chosen the right approach. We should continue to discuss this in the second reading, also involving the Council and Commission. I believe that we will then also achieve positive results. Matthias Groote  (S&amp;D
).

 Mr President, Seveso, Enschede, Toulouse – these places are synonymous with major disasters that result not just in environmental disaster, but also in loss of life and the destruction of private property. That is why we must do everything we can to reduce the risk, as well as the likelihood, of such accidents being repeated. How do we do that? Firstly, we must allow even unscheduled inspections, and it must not be simply routine. The people who live close to such industrial establishments must be very well informed of what is going on there, what happens there. In the event of an incident, we must make sure that the situation is clarified promptly. This is very important, because it can save human lives. I think the Council has not done itself any favours here. I also think the Council should be here for this debate in Parliament. Apparently, however, other things are more important. I think the Council might have saved face if it had explained why this legislation has been watered down. That is what I would have liked to see. However, strong legislation in this area will also create confidence. This confidence is needed when the Member States plan large infrastructure projects. At such times, there are always major reservations among the population. Strong legislation here, such as we have achieved today, creates confidence; and that is only possible where there is the greatest possible degree of transparency. It also requires authorities to be better networked with each other, to cooperate more with each other; we also need more communication, and dealing with such large, dangerous establishments must never become routine. We must not allow that to happen. Matthias Groote  (S&amp;D

Blue-card question

 A blue card, because we have now heard a great many critical voices. I know that Mr Seeber has dealt with the procedure in Parliament very well, having taken this over from János Áder. My question is simply: we are now concluding this at first reading, as we do for as much as 65% of our environmental legislation. My question to the rapporteur is whether we might not perhaps have been able to achieve greater transparency, even though the Council took a blocking attitude, if we had taken it to a second reading? This is a fundamental issue. Richard, I realise that you took this over. However, I would like to hear the current rapporteur’s view on this. Matthias Groote  (S&amp;D

 Mr President, Commissioner, rapporteur, shadow rapporteur, the spirit is willing, but the flesh is weak. That is what you could say about resource conservation. Everyone wants to move in the right direction, but how do we get there? Voluntary measures – as we have seen time and time again, in the automotive industry, in other areas – have been a resounding failure. Resource efficiency and the conservation of resources are an element of foreign policy, security policy, health policy, environmental policy, economic policy, agricultural policy – they affect all areas. Looking at the empty Council benches, I can only say that I am astonished that the Council is not here today, but perhaps things will take a bit longer, because they are missing something today – namely, the presentation and debate on a very, very good report by Mr Gerbrandy. This topic is by no means dealt with yet, and this matter will decide whether Europe lives in prosperity in future and what our environment in Europe will look like. It is now a matter of finding the instruments. The internalisation of external costs – there is no way around it: this principle must be introduced. Anyone who pollutes water or air must pay for it. At the moment, we pay for it via our health insurance or through other areas – we are paying for it with our taxes, Ms Gardini. This has to be internalised, and here we need to be courageous for once, because only then will we deal with the future challenges that we face. A growing world population – not in Europe, we will get smaller in the future – is a huge challenge, and therefore this report that Mr Gerbrandy has produced is a good starting point for considering new political strategies, and that applies to the Commission, too. We have to think in terms of life cycles – instead of simply regulating what comes out of the exhaust, we also need to look at the factory where the car is manufactured. Is that sustainable, does it conserve resources? We must think in terms of complete cycles and be courageous about this and not stick with the status quo
 – because if we do, we will pay very, very dearly for it. (Applause) Matthias Groote  (S&amp;D

Madam President, firstly, I would like to congratulate Mr Gerbrandy. This is a very good report and it gives us guidelines as to how we should act in forthcoming legislative procedures and during major reform processes. The litmus test will come when we discuss agricultural reform. Many of the speeches today have already made this clear. This is where we will have the opportunity to do more to promote biodiversity and to show our other partners, for example, at the Rio+20 conference, that we take this subject seriously. The Heads of State or Government agreed in 2001 that biodiversity must be protected. Unfortunately, we have failed to achieve this objective. The window of opportunity is gradually closing and it is time for us to act. The problem will not be resolved solely by this strategy. The whole issue must be incorporated into the reform of fisheries and agriculture policy and given a more concrete form. Matthias Groote  (S&amp;D
).

 Mr President, it is important that resource efficiency is also included in the 7th Environment Action Programme (EAP), which is what we have been discussing today. I hope that we will vote in plenary in the same way as we voted in the committee and that the Rio+20 conference will be a great success. Following the discussions with the environment ministers this week, I am in a very positive mood. We should design the 7th EAP accordingly and include the concrete decisions which we hope will be made in Rio, in other words, the international dimension. As far as doing business sustainably is concerned, we need to introduce an end-to-end approach, for example, in car manufacturing. We must consider the car from production right through to recycling. To achieve this, we need a legislative framework. The 7th EAP is a good location for this framework, which can then be applied when the relevant legislation is revised. Matthias Groote  (S&amp;D
).

 Mr President, we are discussing the changeover to a low-emissions economy. We have heard a number of people today tell us that we should continue as before. Mr Davies’ report contains an important point: if we continue as before, this will cost 5% of gross domestic product in the future. A full 5% of gross domestic product if we continue as before! Accordingly, the contents of the report represent a start. Naturally we are only responsible for 12% of emissions. However, if someone does not make a start, no one will. There will be a battle for resources and the lower our emissions in the future, the fewer raw materials we will consume. There will also be a radical economic impact if we fail to take evasive action, investing in renewable energies and reducing emissions from traffic. We have made a start here. This is a difficult path, both within the EU and internationally, which is why we need more diplomatic activity around climate issues. The European External Action Service needs to play its part in ensuring more is done with regard to climate-related diplomacy. We resolved here to include aviation in the Emissions Trading System. At present this is encountering international resistance – to put things diplomatically. Nonetheless, we are on the right track. If the US, Russia and India develop a similar system, then we will of course be willing to cooperate with them and to show them the hand of friendship. Nonetheless, someone has to make a start. That is what we have done. It will also be evident in economic terms that we made a start in good time. This is a good report and everyone in the Chamber today bears some responsibility in making this report a success. We cannot afford for the report to fail, like its predecessor, the Eickhout report. That would be a completely destructive signal to the citizens of Europe and the world’s public at large. Hence my call to all my fellow Members: each of us must move a little from our positions if this report is to be a success. Matthias Groote,

 Mr President, I am grateful to the Commissioner for the opportunity to debate this important topic today. In my country, Germany, 900 holdings are affected by the Schmallenberg virus and the numbers are growing. Naturally there are also signs of fear in the public debate in relation to the agricultural sector, ranging from loss of income to complete loss of livelihood, as well as public health concerns. After all, it is not possible to offer a 100% guarantee that this virus will not affect humans. The European Food Safety Authority has already announced that it wishes to work closely with the European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control in order to keep a close eye on the impact on public health. I believe that this is very important. A monitoring procedure does exist and has been simulated once by EFSA. We have just heard that eight Member States have been affected by this disease so far, and our fears are that the outbreak will spread as the flying insect population increases in spring and summer. A number of different scenarios have been identified. Can the Commission indicate precisely what steps it will take to combat the situations revealed in the simulation? Perhaps you are still at the analysis stage? This is a very important point. It is also important that the general public should see that steps are being taken to control this disease. I am aware that this is something new, and that we do not have specific means for combating this disease. Nonetheless, I would ask what steps is the Commission planning, or has it already taken to ensure that this disease does not spread to all 27 Member States? Eight countries are affected so far and we do not want to see the disease spread to all 27 Member States. Matthias Groote  (S&amp;D

 Madam President, Mr Duff has presented us with a visionary and – as he said himself – radical proposal for the reform of the electoral system. I believe that that is a good thing; we need proposals and we need more Europe in European politics. However, the reality currently looks rather different: 18 fellow Members are still waiting to be able to come here to Parliament and we are already talking about expanding Parliament by another 25 Members. I think it is good that this report, most of which I support, will be debated once again in the Committee on Constitutional Affairs and that we will then adopt this Duff report here with a broad majority the third time around, because we need a uniform electoral system. I would like to share many of Mr Duff’s visions with him. Hopefully, we will adopt the final report in the second half of this year and then also implement it. However, I believe that we need a broad majority, not just a slight majority, because then we will really make ourselves heard with this proposal. Matthias Groote,

 Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, firstly I would like to thank the rapporteur and all those involved in this process because tomorrow, after the vote, a long period of hard work will finally come to a conclusion. This is a good day for Europe, for the European Parliament as an institution, and for the Commission because we have succeeded in getting a common transparency register off the ground. This an important step along the way, but more work needs to be done. I would like to address two points. The first is that the register is not really mandatory. This needs to be stated openly at this point. I have a question for the Commissioner in this regard: the Commission has always claimed that the appropriate legal framework for this does not exist. Is the Commission ready to establish such a legal framework, so that we will have a mandatory register after the revision? I was very pleased by the statement from the Council indicating that it does not foresee any difficulty in joining our register, as Mr Weber has just pointed out. I am hopeful that the Council will follow through on this, because the register will really only be complete if all three institutions of the European Union have a common register and if this register is also mandatory. As a group, we favour the amendment brought forward by another group requiring that the money spent on lobbying should also be listed in the transparency register; we intend supporting this amendment. As far as the various national lobby groups are concerned, it has been clearly stated that these will not be included in the register. I would like to thank all my fellow Members for their willingness to compromise on this matter. It really would have been a black mark for such an agreement if national lobby groups were treated in the same way as industry lobbyists or other professional associations. Matthias Groote  (S&amp;D

Madam President, I would like to thank Mr Duff for bringing up the issue of the legislative footprint. Do you believe that a legislative footprint, the extent of which still has to be defined, might also restrict the work of the European Parliament? Also: how far-reaching do you expect the impact of the legislative footprint to be? Matthias Groote,  
on behalf of the S&amp;D Group.
 – (DE)
 Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I would like to start by expressing my gratitude for the way in which we have been able to work together so constructively. We have reached a good compromise today from an environmental and an economic perspective. Even though we could, in my opinion, have gone further with regard to the limit, the legislation that we are adopting today is still the strictest in the world for light commercial vehicles. We must not forget that. Mrs Hedegaard has already said that, outside the Emissions Trading System, these small sector-specific pieces of legislation which we are introducing are very important in allowing us to achieve the goals that we have set ourselves. If vehicles use less fuel, this brings added value not only for the climate but also for air quality. With a limit of 147 grams, which is the equivalent of 5.6 litres of diesel, vehicles will produce less pollution. This means that the air quality in our cities will improve. We are taking an important step forward today. My group is voting in favour of this compromise package because it includes an important point which states that we must evaluate in 2014 at the latest whether the targets that we are adopting today have been met or exceeded and whether we need to make adjustments in this area. This was a fundamental requirement for our group. I have had long discussions with my colleague, Mr Pirillo, about the nature of this compromise and that was one of the basic prerequisites of the compromise package. Some comments have already been made about the first reading. We should make sure in future that we reach fewer first-reading agreements. In this case, it is acceptable because the negotiations ultimately only concerned 2 grams. We did not need to introduce that into the second reading. However, if we adopt everything during the first reading, Parliament will be depriving itself of its rights. There is one further point I would like to mention and that is the test cycle. It will be very important for us to have a standardised test cycle in future which will hopefully come into force throughout the world at some point and which will represent reality. Our current test cycles are not realistic and we need to make improvements in this area. International negotiations are under way and I hope that they can be brought to successful conclusion, because this will mean that the legislation will reflect the actual driving cycles. I would like to thank everyone concerned once again. Today is a good day for the European Union’s climate and environmental policy. Matthias Groote  (S&amp;D
).

Madam President, firstly I would like to thank everyone who has made this possible and, in particular, the former vice-president Sylvia-Yvonne Kaufmann, who did much of the preliminary work during the previous parliamentary term to ensure that the day would come when the European citizens’ initiative would become reality. Sometimes the citizens of the EU feel as if Europe and its institutions are very remote. This instrument, the European citizens’ initiative, will bring the institutions closer to the citizens. This is an excellent instrument which will strengthen democracy, involve people more and enable them to take the initiative. I believe that two things will be very important over the next few months. One is creating access, including digital access, to the citizens’ initiative over the Internet in a way which makes it easy to use but is also secure. The second is that if a citizens’ initiative is successful, it should be followed by a legal act. My question to the Commission is therefore as follows: How will we decide in future which initiatives will result in a legal act and which simply in a hearing? Perhaps you could explain this, Mr Šefčovič. I would also like to thank you once again for your work and for the work done by the Council. Matthias Groote  (S&amp;D

 I voted in favour of the report on the restriction of the use of certain hazardous substances in electrical and electronic equipment (RoHS), because the extension of the area of application to cover all electronic equipment represents a definite improvement. However, I find the fact that there are so many exceptions problematic. In particular in the area of renewable energies, photovoltaic modules, which consist in part of cadmium telluride compounds, are not covered by this directive. This substance is not only harmful to health, it is also hazardous and therefore really ought to be placed within the scope of the RoHS Directive. The danger that, as a result, photovoltaic installations would have to completely disappear from roofs would not arise. Rather, there are numerous cadmium telluride-free alternatives on the market. I therefore disagree in this regard with the decision of the majority in Parliament and the Council. Matthias Groote  (S&amp;D

Madam President, the democratic participation of employees in business is one of the cornerstones of social policy in the European Union. For a month now, workers at the Atlas plants in Ganderkesee, Delmenhorst and Vechta have been striking day and night for precisely these rights. Workers are fighting to secure a collective wage agreement that will enable good, secure jobs to be preserved. Unfortunately, the management has refused point blank to negotiate with the Industrial Union of Metalworkers and the works council. During the course of the industrial dispute, employees have been extremely intimidated and pressurised by management. I wish to call on the management, specifically Mr Filipov, to open discussions and to return to the negotiating table. Democratic participation cannot be allowed to stop at the factory gates. A hire-and-fire system engenders fear and sows the seeds of social unrest. There should be no place for such systems in Europe, as they are damaging to our democracy. Matthias Groote  (S&amp;D

 I voted against the Gallo report because I cannot support measures that have even remotest chance of resulting in people having their Internet access blocked or in the loss of the neutrality of the Internet. Moreover, the report makes no distinction between commercial and non-commercial file sharing, thereby criminalising private Internet users. Furthermore, the report does not contain a definition of the word ‘piracy’, which could counteract such hasty criminalisation. In contrast, the report makes recourse to demands from the very controversial ACTA agreement and to the call for the acceleration of the negotiations. I cannot support such a report.

Madam President, Commissioner, we have gathered here today at this late hour shortly before midnight to debate the subject of climate change. It is a subject that has moved into the background somewhat. We have had a financial and economic crisis – in fact, we are still in it – but nonetheless, this subject is an important one. That is also why my fellow Members have asked what line the Commission intends to take at the forthcoming ICAO negotiations. As Mr Liese has just outlined, here in Parliament, we have long grappled with reaching a compromise on the inclusion of aviation in the emissions trading system. We have conducted delicate negotiations with the Council. I feel that we also need to make this clear to the outside world – indeed internationally. As far as ICAO is concerned, and as far as reducing CO2
 emissions from aviation is concerned, my feeling is that so far, a lot of time has been invested in this, but with minimal results. We therefore need to defend our proposal on the international stage in the same way as it was defended here in Parliament, where it was adopted with a large majority. The European system will come into effect in 2012 and we have included third countries in it. That means that if an aircraft takes off in Washington and lands in the European Union, then it will fall within the emissions trading system of the European Union. Climate change is a global problem, and consequently, it is a problem that must be tackled globally. If we are serious about doing so, then we need to develop fiscal instruments. We have imposed duties on small vehicles, such as cars and lorries. Unfortunately, we are not in a position to develop uniform tax rates in Europe. I am therefore under no illusions that there is any possibility of developing an international CO2
 tax. Instead, the second best solution is therefore emissions trading, ideally globally, with rules covering third countries. These rules on third countries must also be defended tooth and nail by the European Commission and by the Council, which unfortunately, is not present at this late hour. The US is an international player. The Obama administration initially set its sights high where climate legislation is concerned. To date, however, this has not been followed up by action. The ball is now in the US’s court as regards getting climate legislation under way and harmonising and fine-tuning it internationally. This is very important. The UN climate conference in Copenhagen was a flop, as we all know. It was not crowned with success. I fear that ICAO and Annex 16 of the ICAO Agreement, which regulates environmental measures, will also be a flop. Therefore, my question to the Commission is as follows: if no agreement is reached this time regarding the inclusion of aviation in emissions trading, is the Commission actually prepared to continue negotiating at ICAO level? Is there a Plan B in this event? How will the European Commission and also the Council react in this event? Matthias Groote and Bernhard Rapkay  (S&amp;D

 The German Social Democratic (SPD) delegation in the European Parliament is in favour of combating international terrorism and providing permanent protection for personal data with the highest possible degree of determination and effectiveness. In view of the importance of data protection, the SPD delegation did not make its decision lightly. After long and careful consideration, however, we are now able to vote in favour of the agreement: the Social Democrats have succeeded in providing for the establishment of permanent European monitoring in connection with the extraction of the data directly on the ground in the US Treasury Department – including the facility to stop the extraction of data. For us, the top priority was limiting the transfer of bulk data. SEPA data are not covered by the agreement; most transfers are not affected at all. The five-year data retention period is intended to be reviewed annually, whereby any data that is not needed is to be deleted sooner than this. In addition, an annual review of compliance with all data protection standards, with the involvement of data protection supervisors, is provided for. Even though we would have preferred the monitoring role and the transfer of data to be given to a judicial authority, Europol must carry out its mandate for approving the data transfer, provided for in the agreement, under the strict scrutiny of the EU. Although Europol has a reliable data protection system, it needs to be brought into line with the Treaty of Lisbon so that it can perform its duties under full democratic scrutiny.

 Mr President, it was not possible for me to vote ‘No’ in the vote because the voting machine only displayed something once I had pressed the ‘Yes’ button followed by the ‘Abstention’ button. Please would you check once again how the machine is collecting and counting the votes, because in my opinion, it was not conclusive. I was not the only one who found this; a number of other Members had the same experience. They were unable to press the ‘Abstention’ button or the ‘No’ button, but instead had to vote ‘Yes’ first. It makes this voting process rather hazardous. Please would you therefore check again how the votes were counted. Matthias Groote  (S&amp;D

Madam President, first of all I should like to thank the rapporteur, Mr Méndez de Vigo. I see no need to convene a convention. It is a matter of detail that needs to be clarified. Since 1979, the European Parliament has been elected in a direct and secret ballot and that is the way it should continue to be done in future, too. We and the Council would be well advised to deal with this problem as quickly as possible at an intergovernmental conference, because out of the 18 Members, 16 are in a state of suspense, which is rather intolerable. The ball is therefore back in the Council’s court. I would ask the Council not to give in on this point because one Member State has failed to find clear rules on account of it expecting the Treaty of Lisbon to enter into force sooner. I am pleased that we now have this Treaty in place, but we now have our homework to do. The Méndez de Vigo report is a good basis for strengthening this process. However, the Council would be well advised not to succumb to the temptation to accept Members being sent here from a national parliament. That would set a precedent and I am not happy to accept that. Therefore, the rapporteur has my full support, with the proviso that no Members be sent here from national parliaments. Matthias Groote  (S&amp;D

 Madam President, Commissioner, Mr Carlgren, ladies and gentlemen, the subject of climate change will keep us occupied much longer than the financial and economic crisis. There are parallels – both cost lots of money, and Copenhagen will be about reaching an agreement on the financial tools for the third world and the developing countries. The Copenhagen conference must succeed, and we can play our part in achieving that. Yesterday, we did a good job, we adopted the resolution in the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Food Safety by a large majority, and I think that the resolution will achieve a large majority here in Parliament, and in so doing, we will change the political climate as Copenhagen approaches. There is often a psychological side to it, and we should all play our part in that. I do still have one specific concern. In the European Parliament, we have worked to get aviation included in emissions trading, and in the end we succeeded. I therefore call on the Commission and the Council to ensure that this subject is pursued consistently in Copenhagen. We must achieve international agreement to the effect that shipping, and also aviation, are incorporated into the successor treaty to the Kyoto Protocol. This is because these two transport sectors are growing to a disproportionate degree and are therefore contributing in a disproportionate way to global warming. We should not exceed the 2 degree Celsius mark. That, in fact, is where the parallels between the financial crisis and climate change cease. If we go over this mark, we will have done irreparable damage to our planet and that means that it is damage that we will not be able to reverse. Matthias Groote  (S&amp;D

 Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, I very much liked what the Commissioner described here today with regard to the Desertec project. This project has huge potential and its appeal indeed lies in the fact that it is made up of many separate small projects. This will create jobs and will prepare the way for the environmentally sound industrial policy that we are striving for. I have a question for the Commission. When you were talking about the Desertec project, I had the feeling that the handbrake was on to some extent. What concrete measures are planned with regard to network infrastructure, which is a massive problem in connection with the development of renewable energy? The idea is, of course, to transmit the electricity to Europe via high voltage direct current lines from the deserts. What supporting measures can the European Commission take with regard to this? Is something already being considered in this regard? What can we expect from the next Commission in this area? Matthias Groote  (S&amp;D

 Madam President, Commissioners, ladies and gentlemen, this is, of course, not the first time that we have debated the subject of Opel and the car industry. I am pleased that the rescue succeeded. There were other proposals on the table, such as a structured insolvency. In the supply industry – and I have just come from Bavaria, where I visited a supply company – people are very urgently dependent on orders. Things have got out of control. If Opel, too, had been driven to insolvency, things would have been very, very bad and the consequences would have been devastating. We have just heard the Commission’s conclusions. There was a car industry summit, in which the Commission took part, but we actually heard nothing after the summit. Today we have heard where the problem may lie. what is not possible. That must change in future – we need to hear from the Commission what is possible, so as to forestall nationalistic debates. The Commission needs to mediate more effectively so that we pursue a common European industrial policy. That is also what I hope for from the next Commission. Norbert Glante,

 Mr President, Commissioner, I would like to apologise. The Parliament building’s lifts were very busy. Perhaps the manufacturers should think about including a priority override function. That is why I am a little late. Commissioner, I am much obliged to you for answering these pressing questions. Forgive me if I repeat myself a little, but I simply want to emphasise a point – I believe that the GMES (Global Monitoring for Environment and Security) programme is one of the two leading initiatives in the European Union’s space policy and is of key importance for the monitoring of the Earth. This, in turn, is an indispensable instrument in the fight against climate change, environmental pollution, disaster prevention and security, sustainable development, mobility and crisis management. GMES was established as a Union programme and will receive funding of about EUR 3.2 billion from the budget until 2013. The lack of a workable financial plan for long-term, solid financial support would probably mean that the costs will rise in the long term. The programme and the associated supply of data could be temporarily suspended or even abandoned entirely. In the final analysis, this could mean that the investments previously made will have been in vain. Europe could lose its independence and technological edge in relation to this important space infrastructure. What is at issue? We are talking about a sum of EUR 5.8 billion for the period 2014 to 2020, admittedly a very large amount of money, but one that offers a very substantial economic benefit. Despite the current budgetary difficulties in many Member States, GMES must be sufficiently financed in the budget and through the financial perspective. Mr Barnier, you wrote us a letter recently. If I might quote you: ‘Europe should not be satisfied with defensive answers to the crisis – however important this may be – Europe must also open up the prospect of new growth for its citizens!’ This idea could be expressed very succinctly. It is possible to drive oneself to destruction through excessive savings. This principle applies in a different context to an important Member State of the European Union. If GMES is to be run on an intergovernmental basis in future outside the budget, so that Parliament would no longer have a say in the project, then, in my opinion, the European space strategy would be doomed before it even began. This is why we are calling for a legislative proposal from the Commission for the long-term administration, financing and implementation of GMES and the embedding of the budget in medium-term financial planning. The Danish Presidency announced conclusions for the Competitiveness Council on 21 February and then cancelled them again because there was no majority in the Council. Some Member States question whether the Council Working Party on Space should be responsible for this project, which I find particularly surprising. Unfortunately, this development in the Council has given rise to two camps. One camp, a group of Member States that fund GMES through the budget, has also written to you. A second group wants to follow the proposal tabled by the Commission. If this stalemate continues, I fear that GMES may fail and that an enormous opportunity will have been lost. This is quite apart from the fact that many millions of euro already spent on the project will have been spent for nothing. The greatest risk, however, is that we will set a precedent, and that the Member States will use this to justify activities outside of the Treaty of Lisbon. I thought we had put these times behind us. I have three demands. Firstly, I hope that we, the European Parliament, will be courageous enough to continue to finance the major projects of the EU, such as GMES, but also Galileo and ITER, through the budget and to establish separate budget lines with sufficient reserves for this purpose. Secondly, I hope and demand that the Commission tables this legislative proposal as soon as possible. Thirdly, I call on the Council to push through reasonable and sufficient funding within the budget and to take the necessary decision. Norbert Glante,  
rapporteur.

 Mr President, I want to keep this brief. I know Members are not always pleased when the rapporteur speaks again before the vote. I simply wanted to thank all those involved and, in this context, I hope that this signal can soon be put to use so that there are enough satellites in orbit, and that the Member States come up with sufficient money for the future budget and the financial perspective so that the Galileo navigation satellite system is actually put into operation. Many thanks once again; I hope we have a bright future ahead of us. Norbert Neuser  (S&amp;D

 Mr President, Baroness Ashton, you spoke about how important it is to bring about peace in the Middle East. You said that the Middle East Quartet is playing a positive role and that the EU should support Jordan and the Quartet. The Israeli Government claims that it is in favour of a responsible peace process and a two-state solution, but the reality looks rather different. The Gaza Strip is still an open-air prison. The EU and the United Nations are constantly providing more money to feed the people in Gaza and the Israeli army has destroyed aid projects set up by the EU in occupied Palestinian territory in recent years which cost EUR 50 million. The aim of these aid projects was to provide better living conditions for the Palestinians and they included schools, infrastructure and education projects. We owe it to our taxpayers in the EU to make it clear to the Israelis that this situation has to change and that Israel’s settlement policy must finally come to an end. Norbert Neuser,

 Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, the beginning of 2012 is a timely occasion for the report on universal energy access, as the United Nations General Assembly has designated 2012 as the International Year of Sustainable Energy for All. To me and to all my fellow Members who worked with me on this report in committee, two facts are particularly important. The first is that we want renewable energy. The second is that we want everyone to have access to these new sources of energy. Consequently, these sources of energy must be affordable by everyone. In the Committee on Development, we worked together very constructively, including with NGOs. In this connection, particular mention must be made of the London-based organisation, Practical Action, and of Sweden’s Stockholm Environment Institute. Our secretariat also provided us with vigorous support in finding ways in which we can forge ahead with universal access to renewable energy. Allow me to clarify once more what we are talking about here. At present, 1.3 billion people live without electricity. A total of 2.7 billion people use biomass to cook, on improvised stoves. The vast majority of these live in rural areas, mainly in sub-Saharan Africa and India. To give just one example: 20% of the population of Kenya has access to the grid, but only 5% of the rural population. Access to energy brings not only light and power, but also – and above all – cooking facilities and heating. Yet access to energy is still not a Millennium Development Goal. Without access to it, however, it will be difficult to achieve our Millennium Development Goals. That is why we call in the report for renewable energy to be included in the post-2015 MDGs. It is hard to see how schools, training facilities, health centres and hospitals could exist or function without electricity. Cooking and heating with biomass causes millions of deaths each year in shacks, as a result of harmful smoke. Many of Africa’s governments have therefore banned the use of coal for cooking and heating, for climate and health reasons. In practice, however, those responsible have to look the other way when coal is produced and sold. We very much welcome the fact that, in its Agenda for Change, the Commission has included energy as a guiding priority. Allow me, therefore, to summarise our key demands in the report once more. We call on the EU and the Member States to support the UN goals of universal access to energy by 2030 and to align their policies accordingly. We call on the Commission to focus on small, local renewable energy projects, because only then will it be possible to reach the majority of the population. More money should be made available for this. The European Investment Bank and the other European development banks are not geared towards small, local energy projects. That has to change; universal energy access should be prominently represented in the Rio+20 process. Finally, universal energy access should be included as a Millennium Development Goal post-2015.

 Madam President, Baroness Ashton, the European Union is involved in a number of missions in Afghanistan on the basis of United Nations resolutions. Too many young soldiers from Europe have lost their lives in Afghanistan. A large number have been seriously injured or are suffering from the mental stress caused by military service. Thousands of civilian aid workers from Europe risk their lives every day to help to bring about a better future in Afghanistan. All of them and all of us have a right to know how Europe’s commitment in Afghanistan can be bought to successful and lasting conclusion and how long we will continue to have a military presence in the country. What needs to be changed or improved and what are the objectives of the new EU strategy for Afghanistan? We need to make greater efforts in the area of civil reconstruction. We must at last make progress with retraining the Afghan police force and judiciary. We know that there will not be a military solution and, therefore, we must increase our efforts to bring about a political solution to the conflict, by means of the EU and a common foreign policy. We must show determination and push forward with the internal reconciliation process in Afghanistan and include moderate members of the Taliban. We need to put in place specific initiatives, in particular at a regional level, to stabilise the situation. This involves, in particular, effective means of combating drug cultivation and trafficking. Our strategy includes good proposals. We call on the Afghan Government to demonstrate that it has the will to introduce a better system of governance which is free from corruption. However, the new EU strategy can only be successful if it no longer plays a passive role, but actively involves the neighbouring countries. Baroness Ashton, we are putting our hopes on you, we are relying on you and you have our full support. Norbert Neuser  (S&amp;D

 Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, the signs look very promising for the EU-Africa summit. The summit will revolve entirely around an equal partnership for a better common future. Two months after the Millennium Development Goals summit in New York, we have the unique opportunity to take further specific, binding steps in the fight against poverty in Africa. We are, of course, following all of China’s extensive activities on the African continent to safeguard its own supply of raw materials with great concern. It is very much reminiscent of the behaviour of colonial states. The European Union must, therefore, press for a regulation that promotes the common good of, and social progress in, the African countries. That will create work that is sustainable. I therefore expressly welcome the Commission’s proposal to employ effective controls in the context of raw materials management. Together with the African partners, we need to support a structural policy that promotes growth and climate protection in order for the African people to escape from the poverty trap. We support the Commission’s proposals for social cohesion, because they will help to create jobs. We must put the people of Africa in a position where they can achieve the goal of earning a living wage through their own work. Finally, I would like to provide a summary of the following priorities. Firstly, we need to strengthen the African Union and its representations in all international bodies – the Security Council, G20 and the Pan-African Parliament. The Millennium Goals must be achieved in Africa by 2015 by means of further initiatives. We must ensure that the social standards stipulated by the International Labour Organisation (ILO) are laid down and made binding in any economic and trade agreements between the EU and Africa. Norbert Neuser  (S&amp;D

 Madam President, Commissioner, I welcome the clear words chosen by Mr Piebalgs. It is important for the European Parliament to show clearly where it stands and also to condemn the brutality that has taken place there. It has taken us a long time to hold the debate on Western Sahara in the European Parliament, and I think that we have been too hesitant in our actions and that we act only after there have been fatalities there. I am pleased that we will be able to adopt a resolution tomorrow with all parties, which will perhaps not go as far as one or other of the groups would like, but it represents a broad consensus and is a clear signal to Morocco and to the population of Western Sahara that the European Parliament stands by its fundamental values. As chair of the Intergroup, I would like to offer my sincere thanks to all of its members, who have ensured that Western Sahara has remained, and will continue to remain, on the agenda. I am certain that, together with Mr Piebalgs and Baroness Ashton, we must remain committed to Western Sahara. Norbert Neuser  (S&amp;D

 Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, achievement of the Millennium Development Goals by 2015 is crucially dependent on how much money the rich industrialised nations make available for combating hunger and poverty, reducing child and maternal mortality and combating malaria and AIDS. Our conclusion is sobering. Our promises will not be met. Prior to the financial crisis, we in Europe, as rich industrialised nations, had promised the poorest countries USD 50 billion for this year, 2010. It will be significantly less than that: around USD 36 billion. Even the agreed twelve-point action plan, according to which the wealthy countries want to give 0.7% of their gross national income in development aid, will not be fulfilled. Some countries are setting a good example, but my country, Germany, does not look good. We ought to follow the example of other countries like Sweden, Luxembourg, Belgium, Ireland, the United Kingdom and even Spain. Peter Simon,  
deputising for the rapporteur Mojca Kleva Kekuš

 Mr[nbsp ]President, our colleague, Mojca Kleva Kekuš, who is the co-rapporteur on this file, became a mother two months ago so she cannot be here with us today. I wish her and her little daughter all the best. She did a lot of good work on this dossier, so allow me now to present her words and ideas. A year ago, with the change in international standards, Parliament received a package of Commission proposals for updating and improving European legislation on combating money laundering more effectively. At a time when technology and the means available to criminals are constantly evolving, it is crucial that our legislation should keep pace with the changing realities. We now have before us an updated regulation, which will enhance the transparency of fund transfers of all types: domestic and cross-border. The regulation lays down rules for our banks and other payment-service providers regarding information on payers and payees which they need to collect and transfer throughout the entire payment chain. This update will make it easier for law enforcement authorities to track funds transferred by criminals and terrorists. The new rules will help to identify not only the payers but also the receivers of laundered money. The new regulation focuses more closely on the effectiveness of regimes to counter money laundering and terrorist financing, and on ensuring greater clarity and consistency of rules across the Member States. It is also broader in scope, with a view to addressing new threats. The rapporteur, Ms[nbsp ]Kleva Kekuš, is also pleased that, thanks to Parliament’s involvement, the regulation is now more effective in ensuring compliance with European data-protection requirements, guaranteeing that all the safeguards protecting individual rights in relation to personal data will actually be applied. What remains crucial in making the fight against money laundering effective, however, is the work on enforcement and implementation of the new rules. To combat this problem effectively we need two things at the same time: a coordinated response from law enforcement bodies in the Member States and a standard procedure for financial institutions and payment-service providers. The new rules now centre on a risk-based approach, which should strengthen the capabilities and roles of payment-service providers in identifying transfers that smell fishy. To conclude, the danger of money laundering is also closely linked with the problems of tax evasion and tax havens. This Parliament has, on numerous occasions, called for concrete and effective action to eliminate the scandalous tax gap. The improvement of these rules on fund transfers will serve as one small piece of the puzzle. The rapporteur, Ms[nbsp ]Kleva Kekuš, believes that, thanks to good cooperation and hard work on the part of the other co-rapporteur and all the shadows, the text in front of us is something that Parliament can be proud of. She thanks everyone for their contribution. Peter Simon  (S&amp;D

Mr President, Mr Louca, you have emphasised the importance of this House in relation to the continued development of economic and monetary union. I therefore allow myself to refer to paragraph 8 of the report that we are adopting today. With this paragraph this House calls on the Council to finally bring to a conclusion the legislative procedures relating to the realisation of economic and monetary union that are being blocked by the Council. Nine months ago this House adopted a key part of the banking union legislation, that relating to deposit guarantees, at first reading. Since then it has been up to the Council to respond and find a common position. For nine months the Council has been sleeping on this. For nine months the Council has been inactive, and you, Mr Louca, as the President-in-Office of the Council, have taken no action – absolutely no action at all – in relation to the European Parliament in four and a half months to move this legislative procedure forward! We have promised European taxpayers that future crises will not be paid for by them, but by the banks themselves. If we now endeavour to implement supervision quickly, we will be making use of the European Stability Mechanism. Also taxpayers’ money! A reliable deposit guarantee scheme, a reliable fund for the recovery and resolution of banks – these are funds that relieve the burden on taxpayers. Devote yourself to these funds with the same zeal! Make exactly the same progress with them! You will be judged on this by European taxpayers, but also by this House. Peter Simon  (S&amp;D
). 
 – (DE) 
Mr President, Commissioner, I extend warm thanks for your cooperation on one of the important elements in the banking union project, deposit guarantee schemes. You have quite rightly pointed out that the four pillars alongside supervision are of equal importance. Deposit guarantee schemes and crisis funds are two of these four pillars. This morning, Commission President Barroso stated that we could not have a situation where, in future, citizens would still have to pick up the tab for the mistakes of the banks. As you know, you have significant support in this House for the best possible financing of deposit guarantee schemes and crisis management. However, you know as well as I do that our common opponent is sitting in the Council. You know as well as I do that the deposit guarantee scheme that we adopted with a large, cross-party majority seven months ago with a worthwhile level of funding that would bring stability to the area has been given the green light by this House and sent forward for implementation. For the last seven months, the governments of the Member States have done nothing to meet us half way, nothing to ensure the future stability of the systems. I would like to ask at this juncture how you think we can rescue this situation. One thing is clear: Parliament will not allow plans to be drawn up for chronically underfunded guarantee schemes that are not worthy of the name. How can we work together to persuade the Council to keep its promises, so that our citizens are no longer asked to provide backing for banks that should be wound up or to pay out on deposits, but that the banks themselves should provide their own protections in future by contributing to corresponding funds? Peter Simon,  
rapporteur.
 – (DE)
 Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, tomorrow we are to vote on the new regulation on the deposit guarantee scheme at first reading. This is remarkable on several counts. Firstly, on a procedural level, because, as part of the new regulation of the financial markets, we have thus far managed to reach an agreement between the Council and Parliament at first reading, where both sides at least had a solution that they agreed they could live with. That is not the case here. Agreement between the Council and Parliament has proved impossible. The other remarkable thing is that this proved impossible at a point where the new financial market regulations are most tangible to the people of Europe, because it is their fate at stake, their savings books and their current accounts – in other words, their money. The European Commission made a proposal that initially seemed a little too inflexible in Parliament’s view when it came to the way in which guarantee schemes were to be organised. As rapporteur, I am very pleased that, thanks to the excellent support, cooperation and constant dialogue with the shadow rapporteurs, I have finally succeeded in producing a draft that takes account of this. This means that in future, the principles promised by politicians in all Member States to their people will be embraced in Europe and that, in the event of future bank crises and bank failures, the taxpayer will not be required to pick up the tab, but rather the banks will have saved the necessary resources in a fund during the good times, or at least the less bad times, to enable them to pay depositors, current account holders and savers in the event of a crisis involving the collapse of a bank. In addition to suggesting such a stable fund, we also came up with a solution for the periods within which ordinary citizens should get their money back. I think that the period of one week that we suggest is within a timeframe where people will still manage to get by and will be able to go about their daily business without needing additional cash. We did not think that longer periods without access to finances would be reasonable. We continue to believe that we need to ensure that the different risk profiles of the banks in Europe should be taken into account when payments are made into a guarantee fund. Riskier banks should be required to pay in more than banks that have a lower risk because of their business models. All of these principles were brought together into an overall draft here in Parliament, finding broad majority support in the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs, in a broad coalition of parties, from the Left, through the Socialists, the Greens and the Liberals to the Conservatives. When we came to negotiate with the Member States, this made it all the more difficult for us to understand why they were unwilling to provide the necessary resources for a guarantee fund, to be provided by the banks in order to establish sufficient stability, why it proved impossible to achieve a faster payout for depositors, and why a consumer-friendly solution could not be found, even after eight months of negotiations. We therefore agreed, by means of a first reading, to give a clear signal in favour of consumer protection in Europe. We are prepared to go to a swift second reading with the Council. We wish to thank the Commission for its efforts in brokering a deal. However, we believe that tomorrow, we will have to show the European public what we think is appropriate in relation to depositor protection in Europe. Peter Simon,  
rapporteur.

 Mr President, Commissioner, I can only return these expressions of thanks in equal measure. Like you, I am convinced that there is a positive prospect of success in the coming weeks and months under the Danish Presidency, provided all those involved, by which I mean quite explicitly the Council, enter into constructive negotiations. Constructive negotiations also mean being willing actually to provide certain minimum standards in these guarantee schemes, as emphasised verbally on frequent occasions to the public. Then I believe that we will have no problem and that we will start to see light at the end of the tunnel. I would like to thank the rapporteurs and the shadow rapporteurs for their kind words and for their support to date. I believe that we will also be able to continue working together in this positive vein in the coming months and would like to add my voice to that of Mr Barnier in relation to what we have heard from Ms Ford and Ms Swinburne. I think I could not have put it better myself at this point. I would therefore like to limit my answer to a single point, namely, to the comment made by Mr Stoyanov in relation to the question of a four week payout period versus a seven day payout period. None of us want to make promises that we cannot keep. We therefore need to make it clear that the schemes can pay out within the promised deadlines. National legislation requires British banks to take all the necessary steps to facilitate this. They have already been able to do that. If British banks can do this in seven days, then I believe banks in your country, and mine too, will be able to do the same. We will allow them sufficient time to be able to make money available as quickly as possible in the interests of the public. I believe that this is a point that we will need to discuss further in our forthcoming negotiations with the Council. I would again like to thank all my colleagues and hope that we shall produce a result under the Danish Presidency. Peter Simon,  
rapporteur.

 Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, public services are a fundamental pillar of our European social model and not only play a key role for the individual citizen, but are also of enormous importance for the wellbeing of society at large. For this reason, the following question should be uppermost in our minds when we come to reform the EU State aid rules on services of general economic interest. What conditions are needed to ensure the highest possible service quality and, on the other hand, to guarantee universal access for all levels within the population? The key to the provision and organisation of such high-quality public services is certainty among service providers and public authorities in relation to the general legal conditions, on the one hand, and greater proportionality in the regulations, on the other, so that more attention is paid to the diversity of the various kinds of public service and so that administrative effort is reduced. Thus, the EU State aid rules can only be reformed if the special function of public services is taken into account and if the subsidiarity principle is strictly observed. In addition, a legal framework for public services should be established for a sufficient degree of legal certainty. For us in the Group of the Progressive Alliance of Socialists and Democrats in the European Parliament, the legal basis for this would be Article 14 of the Treaty of Lisbon. However, as we know, opinion in the European Parliament has been divided on this issue for many years. Nonetheless, we believe that this report has succeeded in its objective of finding a compromise that could be accepted by almost all sides. The administrative effort involved in managing compensatory payments to those providing public services is currently too high. This is particularly true for small authorities and service providers. The increase we have called for in the thresholds for exemption from mandatory notification of the European Commission when claiming compensatory payments would provide initial relief. The State aid rules must be designed so that the administrative effort expended by the local authorities and service providers is proportionate to the potential impact on the internal European market and on competition. The special de minimis
 arrangements we propose provide an important basis for this, involving a general exception to the regulations for purely local services and social services. To ensure that we cater more precisely to the special role of social services, we would call for a clear definition and protection of their function and character. In addition, our report also clearly rejects the proposal from the European Commission that efficiency criteria should be introduced for services of general interest as a prerequisite for establishing their compatibility with EU competition rules. The European Commission is going beyond its remit here, as it is simply responsible for controlling State aid. On the other hand, the definition of economic conditions is solely a matter for the Member States and can only be regulated on a European level with the cooperation of the European Parliament. In this context, I would like to close by thanking my colleagues, the shadow rapporteurs, for excellent cross-party cooperation in the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs. The clear vote in favour of my report at committee level is evidence of this results-based, solutions-oriented cooperation. I am therefore confident that in tomorrow’s plenary vote, we shall also succeed in sending out a clear signal from the European Parliament to the European Commission demanding sustainable, future-proofed general conditions in the area of public services. Peter Simon  (S&amp;D

 Madam President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, right across Europe, our cities and communities have to struggle with problem districts. Right across Europe, we try to solve this problem by bringing these disadvantaged areas and the people living in them up to the level of normal life in the rest of our towns and cities. If, however, we now lay down criteria in the field of social housing, as the Commission is doing here, if we lay down criteria that explicitly – as some Members have already said – preclude a mixing of the population in these areas, that will undermine all the efforts made by the competent parties on the ground for decades. It will also undermine ventures that the European Union has promoted with its Community initiatives Urban and Urban II. If, here, we restrict the criteria according to which social housing can be subsidised in such a way that actually only the poorest of the poor, the most disadvantaged of the disadvantaged, receive a subsidy and can be helped within the framework of social housing, we will actually be putting up obstacles to this segment of the population mixing in disadvantaged districts, something that is, in fact, urgently needed. This will lead to more social exclusion of precisely these population groups and will only increase these problems in our cities. With that in mind, a broad definition and broad interpretation of the principle of subsidiarity are the order of the day, and I would be grateful to the Commission if it could briefly express a position in this regard. Petra Kammerevert,  
on behalf of the S&amp;D Group.

 Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, I, too, would like to offer my sincere thanks to Ms Geringer de Oedenberg for the results of her negotiations with the Council. I know that it was difficult to also get the numerous good ideas that we had in Parliament through the tough negotiations with the Council. Certainly, with the directive, we have now found a viable route to granting works of literature orphan work status and preserving this cultural heritage for the future while making it accessible. However, I do still have some minor doubts about whether we have really found an efficient solution for audiovisual works. Across the EU, a cultural asset has accumulated in the archives, especially of broadcasters after 1945, that is of inestimable value. Preserving this cultural heritage for the future, too, poses an enormous challenge on both a technical and financial level. The number of rights holders for audiovisual works is frequently higher than for written works. The diligent search that, under the directive, will also be necessary for audiovisual works takes a form that is therefore intensive in terms of costs, time and personnel. There is a great cultural policy interest in preserving our audiovisual heritage, especially in this Internet age. We now need to carefully observe whether we have succeeded, through this directive, in noticeably reducing the number of audiovisual works in the European Union that are unusable in practical situations due to the rights being unclear. The review clause offers us a good opportunity here. In any case, we need to prevent audiovisual material in the archives going to waste as unrecoverable because it proves too costly to clear up who holds the rights. It goes without saying that, for orphan works, too, rights holders must be given reasonable remuneration. The involvement of collecting societies and other rights declaration systems here could help to remove uncertainties about rights, allow originators to come into their own, and thus also to release cultural treasures. I would have liked to have seen a little greater progress at this juncture, but the first step has been taken, and I believe we will work on this further over the forthcoming years. Petra Kammerevert  (S&amp;D

 Mr President, we must get rid of ACTA and I am pleased that the debate here in Parliament is moving in precisely this direction. ACTA is an attack on fundamental rights, such as the protection of privacy, freedom of information and communication and the right to informational self-determination. It is the whole host of vague legal terms which have opened the door to this. We are faced with the threat that legal protection and legal procedures will no longer be available. We are right to be concerned that providers will be forced to monitor the Internet, put web blocks in place and filter content. Ultimately, this could lead to law enforcement being privatised and the providers being turned into deputy sheriffs. The protection of individuals’ copyright must not, under any circumstances, lead to the freedom of information and communication being undermined. It is true that we need a modern copyright law which has a sensible balance between the interests of the originators and of the users. I would like the Commission finally to submit a proposal for this. ACTA will not help in this respect at all. Instead, it is forcing us to move in a very specific direction. This is why we must say ‘No’ to ACTA tomorrow. Petra Kammerevert  (S&amp;D

Madam President, I would like to bring a little reality to the illusion that has just been so elegantly produced because, from a culture and media policy point of view, the Council’s Common Position is, in fact, a disappointment and unsatisfactory. Frequencies are a scarce public good with considerable cultural and media policy significance. As long as, for example, radio needs frequencies to broadcast its services, these are of particular importance for the freedom of the media and of expression in Europe. The Committee on Culture and Education has put forward a series of proposals for how this can reasonably be taken into consideration. Alongside clear wordings on the special role of radio and the consideration that it needs to be given, we warned that we need to open the door now to the second digital dividend. We called for clear compensation rules so that it is clarified that switchover-related costs, for example for the new procurement of technology in theatres, will be assumed and that provision must be made for compensation for investments that made the digital dividend possible. There is nothing left of all this, apart from the brief reference to the Telecoms Package and a few permissive provisions for the Member States. I now expect the Commission and the Member States to at least demonstrate in their practical actions that they are aware of their responsibilities, that their dealings with this public good will not be solely in pursuit of economic benefit and that they are aware of its importance for media diversity and for the cultural interests of our society. Petra Kammerevert  (S&amp;D
). 
 – (DE)
 Mr President, an open Internet and the guarantee of non-discriminatory access for everyone are essential prerequisites for the freedom of communication, the freedom of information, media pluralism and diversity of opinion. We are therefore sending an important and appropriate signal to the Commission and also to the Member States that we want the ‘best effort’ principle as well as fundamental transparency regulations to be laid down. However, I would have liked us to call on the Commission today to clearly define net neutrality and to enshrine it in law. If we wait any longer, we run the risk that network operators will create a version of reality that will be very difficult to put right later on. I would also have liked to have seen a very clear ban on the control of the content of data packets. I would have liked the back door that this resolution leaves open to be closed today, and from the discussion, I sense that many fellow Members agree with me here. I believe that we should continue to work on this. Petra Kammerevert,  
rapporteur for the opinion of the Committee on Culture and Education

 Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, sexual abuse and sexual violence against children and young people as well as images of this are indeed among the worst possible crimes that anyone could commit against young people. Our highest priority must be to protect the victims, to prosecute the perpetrators and to punish them in a procedure that follows the rule of law. It is therefore good that, together, we have found a way to tackle this crime throughout the EU and to obtain a common basis for this. In the Committee on Culture and Education, in addition to the issues of prevention, effective prosecution, information and more instruction in the use of media, one principle was particularly important to us and that was the principle of ‘deletion rather than blocking’. I am therefore pleased that, after a long struggle, we have succeeded in stipulating the deletion of websites depicting sexual violence against children and young people. The Commission proposed making it mandatory for all Member State to block these websites. However, it is no help to any child at all simply to draw a curtain, so to speak. Internet blocks are ineffective, imprecise, easy to circumvent and do not help to combat sexual abuse. In contrast, they create a censorship infrastructure, an instrument for controlling communication streams and are thus a threat to fundamental rights. In Germany, this has now been implemented. I very much hope that this example will also be followed in other Member States and that they will not use the option of blocking, as stated in the directive. Petra Kammerevert,  
rapporteur for the opinion of the Committee on Culture and Education.

 Madam President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, political initiatives for developing fast Internet connections across the board are, in principle, to be welcomed. However, the spectrum is a scarce resource and, above all, it is a public good. It was therefore a particular concern of the Committee on Culture and Education that it be made clear that the spectrum is, and remains, essential for the fulfilment of a wide range of societal, cultural and social functions. For this reason, it was particularly important to us that the requirements of the telecoms package for safeguarding media pluralism and cultural diversity were not thrown out by the back door. Both public and private broadcasting are essential guarantors of media pluralism and diversity of opinion in Europe. We must ensure that they can continue to fulfil their vital functions unimpeded in future, too. The Committee on Culture and Education had therefore proposed that the 790 band not be opened in the first instance, but unfortunately, the Committee on Industry, Research and Energy did not follow our suggestion. Although it is mentioned in several places that the interests of broadcasting are to be taken into consideration, the Committee on Culture and Education would have liked there to have been much clearer wording in this regard. It was particularly important to us that, before spectrum allocation, clear regulations be laid down to prevent theatres and anyone using wireless microphones, for example, from being saddled with the cost of paying for a frequency change or for new technology. We are all called on to continue to ensure a fair balance of interests for all parties concerned. I hope that we will succeed in doing so in future, too. Petra Kammerevert  (S&amp;D

 Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, first of all, I would once again like to offer my sincere thanks to Mrs Trüpel for the truly excellent report that we are debating today. I believe that it is a splendid project that will be making Europe’s diverse cultural heritage available to the people of Europe and throughout the world in a digital online library. However, it still requires further joint efforts on our part to actually make this project a success. A significant prerequisite for this is, in the view of my group, the free – and that means also, as far as possible, cost-free – access to our cultural heritage via Europeana. In the joint discussions, we have reached a good compromise, which protects the interests of authors of protected works on the one hand while, at the same time, providing the necessary free accessibility, and I would very much like the Commission to also take account of and adopt these proposals in future. Another prerequisite is that the Member States become increasingly aware of their responsibility. For my own country, this means that it is not acceptable for Goethe to be available in Polish and French, but not in the original German. In this regard, we must all jointly call on the Member States more strongly to once again provide the appropriate financial resources to make Europeana a real success on this level as well. Udo Bullmann  (S&amp;D

Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, with or without a summit, Europe is still in recession. There is a lack of growth stimulus and a shortage of jobs. Mr Barroso and Mr Van Rompuy, you will have to launch some fresh initiatives before your term in office comes to end, otherwise there will be no end to this crisis in Europe. A summit, no matter how intensive the debate, cannot change anything. Europe’s young people have no jobs.  Mr Barroso, you have instruments at your disposal. Mr Andor and the Commission could utilise the available instruments. Why are we not making cuts within the framework that we already have, within the framework of the commitments made in the European Semester, tying the Member States into this process and starting straight away? Why are we not focusing on the young unemployed based on a specific annual percentage proposed by the Commission? Why can we do all kinds of things on a binding basis but we apparently cannot combat youth unemployment this way? The European Parliament is waiting for you to take the initiative.  We need more economic policy competences at the European level, that is absolutely right. The basic question is this: who is doing the regulating here, and what are they regulating? Every time the German Finance Minister, Mr Schäuble, comes and talks to us, he says that he would like to have a strong Finance Commissioner. We say, fine, let us give the job to Mr Rehn. That is the Mr Rehn who is possibly listening now to what this House has to say. Mr Rehn, it would be wonderful if you were given more competencies. However, let us make a deal, and let us be quite clear about it: you would then negotiate your mandate with the European Parliament. Life would be very different then. You would not have to ring round all of the European capitals to find out what they wanted at that particular moment. You would not have to negotiate any bilateral agreements with people who have no idea what it is all about. No, you hammer out your mandate with this House. Europe has all the means at its disposal and all the techniques it needs. We should be strengthening the European Union in its present form. We do not need another Europe. We do not need any new institutions. We need to strengthen the existing institutions, and that means strengthening the European Parliament. That is the only way to move out of the crisis. Udo Bullmann  (S&amp;D
). 
 – (DE)
 Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, indeed, the summit has turned around the debate. However, Mr Van Rompuy, the Member States have not yet dared to make the leap. Indeed, it is a major breakthrough to say that we want to make the European Stability Mechanism more active. That is only right and proper. If we do not, we will not really be able to halt the crisis. However, it is also entirely clear to me why the first Member States are already backing off again, why the first heroes of their troops are already disappearing back into the bushes. Why? It is because they forgot to clarify how the stability mechanism would be financed so as to be able to afford this. That takes us to the problem at the heart of this debate. Europe faces a challenge. We will only overcome the crisis if we are able to make a great qualitative leap: more Europe, better ways of working and more joint action. However, we cannot make a run-up to this great leap while at the same time slamming on the brakes. That is what is constantly demonstrated by Member States. I can also say, as regards the second topic, that it is right to say that we want to create a programme for growth. The growth programme is essential. You have opportunities to do so, Mr Van Rompuy, as does Mr Barroso. Simply show us the figures, however, for how much this growth programme can generate. Will it be 0.1%, 0.2%, 0.6% of gross national income? What will it cost to implement the rules of the fiscal pact, which are still too rigid? Perhaps 1%, 1.5%? What is the bill? We need to do more in this direction if it is to work. Udo Bullmann  (S&amp;D

 Mr President, I have one question for the Council and the Commission. I would like to say to the representatives of the Council Presidency: you know very well that the level of public investment in countries like Germany is currently zero. The situation is not much better elsewhere. This means that public property in Europe is falling into disrepair. Wherever the troika is not forcing states to sell this property below its real value, it is becoming dilapidated. What is your response to this? I have not heard you say anything. In the past, Mr Monti’s name was on everyone’s lips and he was frequently quoted when he talked about the internal market. Today, Mr Monti is saying how important it is for us to invest in our national economies and none of you have mentioned his name. Neither the Council nor the Commission have made any comment on his proposals. I would very much like to know why. I believe that there is a reason why we are not making progress. Your explanations that, on the one hand, we need to save and, on the other, that we must stimulate growth are all correct. Unfortunately, however, they do not explain why something is happening. Instead, they explain why nothing is happening. There is a reason why this is the case, which is that the people who have the upper hand in the Commission and in the Council believe that the best way of climbing a mountain is to put on the brakes on the way up. This runs counter to the laws of physics, just as your economic proposals run counter to the laws of mathematics. I expect you to make changes, because if you do not take up a clear position, you will not help Europe to make progress. Udo Bullmann  (S&amp;D
).

 Mr President, Commissioners, ladies and gentlemen, sometimes, I ask myself what you actually take away from these debates with us after sitting here so patiently. Mr Barroso has gone, so it is too late to ask him. The Council is not here either, so the question is superfluous. However, as you are responsible for various areas of the Commission, I can ask you: what will you actually take away from this debate with the European Parliament on an unbelievably serious issue – one that will decide the fate of our populations in the Member States? I will tell you what I am taking away from it: I have a problem. Whenever your services give you reports of how we are not making any progress because growth continues to be in decline, of how employment is in the doldrums, then you get someone to write something about employment and how it can be increased through relatively non-binding measures. I have read it all a hundred times before. Over the past twelve years, I must have read what is written here a hundred times. However, those who commit this stuff to paper are sitting in your departments, Commissioner Rehn. What they actually believe is something different. They believe that we need to chase the countries of southern Europe through a structural recession. Those are the hard facts of the Stability and Growth Pact, those are the hard facts of the fiscal pact, and those are the hard facts of the erroneous expenditure policy. Until you resolve this contradiction and actually commit to paper some concrete measures for raising levels of investment again, the people will not understand you. I do not understand you either. (The speaker agreed to take a blue-card question under Rule 149(8)) Udo Bullmann  (S&amp;D

Blue-card answer.

 Mr President, firstly, I would like to say to the questioner that the countries she mentions only have no problems on the surface. If you actually read the data on the Netherlands, you will see that growth is in decline there too. When Germans read the statistics, they actually know very well that they are very dependent on them. Things may appear to be going better again in the south, but this is only fleeting. On no account should we think that Germany can maintain its export rates in the long term without a functioning euro area. So my answer is yes; we need to arrive at a constellation in which demand in southern Europe is also boosted again. We need to create new jobs and sensible investment projects, and we need to use all the means at our disposal to ensure that we are not organising a recession that lasts 10 or 20 years. Udo Bullmann  (S&amp;D
). 
 – (DE)
 Mr President, the Council Presidency has told us that on 15 May, it will work towards a European mandate allowing the Commission to negotiate. I think that is a good thing. Rightly so. We will then be able to see how far the European Commission gets in its negotiations with Switzerland and others. It is also right, however, when honourable Members say that we should go for enhanced cooperation in areas where they can help us further. Yet you should ask sometime – you do, after all, have an audience for what you are doing – you should ask the German Government and the French Government why they have not been doing that for a long time already. Why is it that in their home countries, they always come out with fine words, but never actually take the initiative. That would be something. Please would you also publicly answer the question as to why the US is apparently far more successful in its bilateral efforts and is able to exert pressure far more successfully – on Switzerland, for example – than the German Government, rather than simply saying that what they are doing is fine. In the interests of our citizens, ask what the US is doing differently to European countries, so that we can make some practical progress at last. Udo Bullmann  (S&amp;D
).

 Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, this is the reality of economic development. The Italian economy began to grow at the beginning of the year and in Spain, the signs of growth are even clearer. The situation in Portugal is no better. There are even problems in the Netherlands and industrial order books are shrinking in Germany. Mr Barroso said before he left that we had had a useful discussion this morning. I am currently trying to work out what he meant by that. Mr Barroso and Mr Van Rompuy said ‘growth and employment’ around 10 to 15 times this morning, it is true. Has that changed anything or will it change anything? No! Repeating empty phrases will not result in any changes taking place. Therefore, I would like to know what is new about the way in which the European Council, the Member States and the Commission are dealing with the problem. Mr Barroso gave us one hint when he said that structural reforms must also involve social cohesion. It would be good if you could explain what you mean by that, because we have been arguing about it for quite some time. What do you mean by this? Do you agree with the idea proposed by Mr Swoboda and the Group of the Progressive Alliance of Socialists and Democrats in the European Parliament that all young people must have prospects for the future, but it is just a question of how we ensure this is the case? Do you want minimum wages in all European Member States which adapt dynamically to productivity and growth? Is that what you want? Then you say that growth is essential. Until now, your services have always denied that this had anything to do with investment, because you said that this only concerned structural reforms. This is why the memorandum of understanding in each individual case relating to this issue is so modest. Where is the investment channel that we argued about during the discussions on the ‘six-pack’? If you have nothing to say about investments, then you also have nothing to say about growth. The time for empty phrases has passed. We are waiting for an answer. (Applause) Udo Bullmann  (S&amp;D
),

 The Members of the European Parliament who belong to the Social Democratic Party of Germany (SPD) would very much have welcomed the introduction by the EU of compulsory contracts at the level of the Member States. However, the Council and the Commission were categorically opposed to this proposal. Nevertheless, the compromise that has been reached allows milk producers throughout Europe to join together in producer organisations. It is of crucial importance for us to ensure that milk producers are put in a stronger position in their negotiations with dairies and retailers. Alongside compulsory contracts, we also strongly supported larger size limits for associations of producer organisations, because that would have further improved the negotiating position of milk producers in Europe. It became clear in this part of the trialogue negotiations that the Council would not have been prepared to accept this, even in the course of a further reading. The opportunity to join together in producer organisations is not a new one for German milk producers because this option is already open to them at a national level as a result of the German Market Structure Act. Given that it was not possible to achieve a better result in the face of opposition from the Council and the Commission, it was all the more important for us to ensure that the interests of small and medium-sized milk producers are taken into consideration in the forthcoming reform of the common agricultural policy (CAP). Conditions must be laid down in the CAP which enable these businesses to continue producing milk even in less favourable regions. This is the only way that we can meet our main requirement, which is to guarantee the existence of a sustainable and multifunctional agricultural industry throughout the whole of Europe.

 Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, let us take a quick look at the harsh economic reality. On the day of the summit, the markets rated Portuguese debt securities for 10-year bonds at 17% interest and for five-year bonds at 20% interest. So much for the question as to the extent to which the summit has helped to calm the economic situation, or the question of to what degree the new intergovernmental treaty has pacified activity on the market. If anyone asks himself where the disquiet is coming from, then perhaps the answer is from the economic data and from the feeling that what we have done is not enough. President Schulz, I would like to thank you expressly for the courage and clarity with which you participated in this summit on behalf of this House in order to say that we will indeed defend the Community method and we certainly want consolidation, but we also need to invest so that Europe’s economies can flourish. I believe that this is a line that this House will be able to agree on, and we will be able to continue to develop a common economic policy. Udo Bullmann  (S&amp;D
). 
 – (DE) 
Madam President, as the coordinator for the Group of the Progressive Alliance of Socialists and Democrats in the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs, I can confirm that Mr Schwab has tabled an excellent proposal that can be supported by all sides of the House, and would encourage others to follow our lead in supporting it. Udo Bullmann  (S&amp;D
). 
 – (DE)
 Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, what does the result of the summit bring us? With regard to the automatic sanctions, I would simply like you to explain, gentlemen, what happens when a country has more than 3% debt in future and you want to apply automatic sanctions, but the country says that Article 126 and the current Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union apply. What will happen then? Then our finest hour, which Mr Lambsdorff has spoken about, will turn out not to have been so fine after all. It is a fake which is not worth the paper it is written on, because it does not change the real situation. In legal terms, what have you actually done? As far as the economy goes, research institutes are saying that in the next two years, perhaps four of the 17 euro area countries will be in a position to achieve the structural deficit target that you have imposed. Possibly by 2015, but only if we can avoid a recession. However, if we take your route, without a growth initiative, we will find ourselves in the midst of a recession. It is a mistake to believe that we can achieve these targets without additional programmes for growth. How will we do it? What have you decided? Without the European Parliament, you will not be able to get out of the mess that you have got yourselves into. Take the opportunity to sit down at the table with the European Parliament and then you will still have a chance. Otherwise, you will find that there are no cards left on the table. (Applause) Udo Bullmann  (S&amp;D

 Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, we all trust that Mr Daul is right when he says that we are hopefully beginning to see the light at the end of the tunnel in this crisis. The litmus test for this question, however, is not to be found in today’s newspaper headlines, but rather in the economic developments of the coming weeks and months. Paragraph 3 of the resolution states: ‘The European Union must improve its prospects for growth and employment.’ This is absolutely correct. A question last night’s document did not answer, however, is the issue of what is to be done in order to improve the prospects for growth and employment. Much later, in paragraph 25, there is an indication of the intent to work out an appropriate strategy. I hope that this will happen. One thing is clear, however, President of the Commission and President-in-Office of the Council: a strategy of cuts without investment will not see us through this crisis. We are already in a state of stagnation and the threat of recession is not far away. Mr Barroso, this will come at a high cost for the people you have referred to, who are at the receiving end of this series of bad decisions, and who will find themselves with no jobs and no income. That is the reason for my question today: When, Mr Van Rompuy, do you intend coming to this House with these proposals so that they can be approved by Parliament? After all, you said yourself that it is a matter for this House to discuss economic policy with you. We must assume responsibility here in a situation where you are obviously ready to curtail the responsibilities of the national parliaments. That is our present task. We would like to hear your answer. Udo Bullmann  (S&amp;D
). 
 – (DE)
 Mr President, President of the Commission, Commissioner, President-in-Office of the Council, there are two questions that remain unanswered in this debate. The first is that, when we read what the World Bank says, when we read what Ms Lagarde at the International Monetary Fund says, it would seem that we are on the brink of a recession. The growth engines have failed. Where are the investments? That is the urgent question for the European Union. I would like to ask you: you refer to the Stability and Growth Pact – where are the investments? You wanted to cut everything do with investments. So, where are the investments? Where can we cooperate so that we can move forward in Europe once again? We Social Democrats are willing to help in finding a strategy that will allow us to move forward. The second question is this: how can we enter into a common bond market? Here, too, you can be sure of our support. Please put forward proposals. Help to convince those in the Council who are still not convinced. We will help you do this, and we would seek the support of the majority in this House. Udo Bullmann  (S&amp;D
).  
– (DE)
 Mr President, I should like to begin my comments with a question to Commissioner Rehn and to Mr Kármán of the Council. Both have spoken of an outstanding matter in the argument between the parliamentary majority and the Council. This week I noted that the Council had opposed text in the report by Mrs Ferreira, the rapporteur for the Group of the Progressive Alliance of Socialists and Democrats in the European Parliament, concerning the symmetrical approach. Are you able to tell me that this problem has been resolved, because the Council voted in favour of the rapporteur? In actual fact, you would then still have a problem between the majority here and the Council – or did you forget to mention that? If so, I should like to know that too, because then I would think that you consider it unimportant. I should like the two of you to explain this to me at the end of this debate. Listening to the two conservative groups in this House, and also to the liberals, I get the impression that if we adopt what they have tabled here then the world will be put to rights. Unfortunately, that is not the case. The world would subsequently be worse, not better – because they have turned an opportunity to create a more common economic policy in Europe into an austerity package. That is a bad thing, because it represents a policy that dates from the last century, because it represents an outdated approach which merely takes sanctions regimes from political techniques and not incentives, or smart taxation, or balanced approaches such as have been represented by us. Various sides of the House have made sufficient pragmatic proposals to allow a balanced package to be tabled. If Mrs Wortmann-Kool wants to claim that it would be blocked by the greens and the social democrats, that is of course simply nonsense. Exactly the opposite is true. To the Members of this House from the Group of the European People’s Party (Christian Democrats) – who run after either the Commission or the Council – I would state that we are not here to let things through on the nod, but rather to think for ourselves. That is what the voters expect of us. I must therefore point out to you that at present you cannot tell whether a Member State is buying defence hardware, fighter aircraft or investing in its education system of tomorrow. You are not in a position to make a qualitative assessment of its budgetary policy. We do, in fact, want to equip you to do so. We wanted a smarter pact which provides greater opportunity for the Commission to have an influence. I cannot understand why Commissioner Rehn is not agreeing to this – more opportunities for influence and a modern economic policy which makes reference to the EU2020 objectives in the interests of our citizens. You have derailed it, and that is a pity. Consequently, this package is by no means balanced. We will continue to fight for a better economic package. We owe this to our electorate. In truth, the answer has to be ‘more Europe’, not ‘less Europe’. It has to be the right Europe, however – not the wrong package. Udo Bullmann  (S&amp;D
). 
 – (DE)
 Mr President, Mr Langen, I just want to make sure that you are familiar with our ideas. I am therefore asking you whether you are aware of what we proposed to your colleague, Mrs Wortmann-Kool, which was firstly that we strengthen the pact by including closer monitoring of selected objectives proposed by Mr Rehn from the EU2020 package, such as research and development and the fight against poverty. This would also include investment in modernising energy supply systems. Udo Bullmann  (S&amp;D
). 
 – (DE) 
Madam President, the Council and Commission are quite right when they suggest that the public budgets in Europe need to be consolidated. However, if we look at how this works and how it will continue to work in the future, then it is evident that the wrong people are being affected. Schools are being closed, teachers are losing their jobs, researchers are finding themselves out on the street and public investments are being cut or left to stagnate. I would like to ask Mr Van Rompuy and Mr Barroso: Is this your intention? Of course you will say that this is not what you want and that other areas are to be cut back. My question then is: Where are the cuts to be made? My key question is as follows: If you believe that the cuts should be made elsewhere, then why is it that the draft that you propose for decision making in the ‘six-pack’ for economic governance makes no distinction as to whether a country purchases tanks or weapons of war or invests in an ailing national economy, or whether it makes an investment in the future? Or perhaps whether it invests in a modern energy supply system and in the education and training of its children? Romano Prodi once famously said that these drafts are stupid. His words are still true because this distinction between good and bad investments cannot be made. Our only choice is to improve these drafts, because Europe cannot be governed sensibly if such distinctions are beyond us. My last question is: Where is the income to be found that will enable us to move forward out of the crisis? After all, we cannot just save our way out of the problem. Mr Barroso, we await your proposal on the financial transaction tax in Europe, something that this House has backed with a large majority. Give Europe a chance and avoid wasting any more time with pious words. Udo Bullmann,  
on behalf of the S&amp;D Group. 
– (DE)
 Mr President, I am sorry, Mr Šemeta, but what you are presenting is not enough. It is months since Parliament gave you the job of investigating what action we can take, including in respect of a financial transaction tax; we gave you the job here in this House. You have not done this. What we know of your position – which has been presented in writing by the Commission on more than one occasion – is something different. You want us to tax the small financial service providers: those that still maintain branches, that care about their customers, that care about medium-sized businesses, that ensure business credit is still available. The parties you do not want to tax are the speculators: those who shift millions and billions around the globe with their high frequency trading, thereby ensuring that our economy is unpredictable – unpredictable even to good entrepreneurs and good investors who want to create decent jobs for the future. Your position is therefore unsatisfactory and consequently, this House must find its own voice. I am sorry to say that Mr Gauzès – whom I otherwise hold in very high esteem – is wrong on this occasion. He is wrong because he is watering down the position adopted by this House previously in the Berès report. Anyone who votes in favour of Mr Gauzès’s proposal will be ensuring that the Commission does what it wants to do anyway – namely, proposes no financial transaction tax. That will be the result of agreeing with Mr Gauzès. That is why it would be wrong to agree with him in this instance. Anyone who wants to give this House a voice, who wants to win back trust, who wants to ensure that the citizens of Europe can once again look to our institutions with hope and a belief that we are doing something to deal with the crises must, in this instance, vote in favour of the alternative motion tabled by the Group of the Progressive Alliance of Socialists and Democrats in the European Parliament and must vote in favour of Amendment 2, which has been endorsed by more than 120 Members of this House from all the major groups. Thank you for your support. Udo Bullmann  (S&amp;D

 Mr President, on behalf of my group I would like to table an oral amendment to strengthen equal opportunities and the aspect of gender policy in the Europe 2020 Strategy. I will read the text out in English – new paragraph 10 a:   ‘Insists that gender equality is a key target for achievement of the ambitions of EU 2020. Calls therefore for the full participation of women in the labour market and the full inclusion of female workers in vocational training. Calls also for an agenda to eradicate the pay gap that exists between women and men.’ (Applause) Udo Bullmann,  
on behalf of the S&amp;D Group. 
– (DE)
 Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, Commissioner, President-in-Office of the Council, I have listened closely to what you have said, I have read the Annual Growth Survey, I have read the Ecofin conclusions and now I am absolutely clear about one thing: the European Union is not only experiencing an economic crisis, it is also experiencing a political crisis. What you are recommending to us is nothing new. Ask your staff to show you the documents from the last ten years. The same thing can be seen in all of them, namely that public expenditure is too high, and the only mechanism for adjustment to new times relates to wages and they are always too high. I have not seen any other recommendations. Whether it is raining or snowing, whether we are in a crisis or a boom – it is always the same ideology, but it has nothing whatsoever to do with empirical economic reality. Allow me to suggest something to you: send those people who write these things for you, who carry out the economic analyses in the Council and the Commission, to the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs sometime. We want to get to know your economic models. We want to discuss with them whether they do not see that Europe is on the brink of recession. Remove the German export rates and the German growth rates for example and then you will see what I am talking about. I will then ask you why there is not a single word about investments – when we have lowest level of investment so far, which we ourselves can no longer afford – why there is not a single word about improvements in revenue and nothing about following the cycles or about the fact that we must finally learn to grow together or how we will get out of the crisis. There is nothing about any of these things in your documents. You missed the start of this year, and you will have to make a great effort to meet the expectations of citizens in Europe. However, let me tell you something: if this is the spirit in which you intend to take a decision in March concerning the cconomic governance package and the reform of the Stability and Growth Pact, my group will be unable to be involved in this. Udo Bullmann,  
on behalf of the S&amp;D Group.

Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, why are we here? Mr Barnier said that we are here because the European Parliament has succeeded in establishing European supervisory authorities that are worthy of the name. That was not part of the Council’s programme. It was not part of the Member States’ programme. The Commission, too, had doubts about how long we would actually persevere with regard to the establishment of this new institution. The Council will understand – it will have to understand – and the Commission will, too – possibly even of its own accord – why we are concerned. No, this European Parliament – and this is a statement that I find applies to all party groups, not just to us as Social Democrats – will not allow national games to be played that undermine the powers of these new supervisory authorities. That is why we are interested in the appointment of staff, of course. We have rights in this regard – we have to be consulted. There are one or two things that in fact give us cause for concern. We receive lists of individuals and we receive lists, which when we look at we cannot actually tell whether a gender criterion has been applied. We are given proposals for candidates, which when we consider – and I say this with all due respect to the people concerned – we do not see anyone that we believe could not do a decent job. These are clearly good people who have already shown in their jobs that they can do their work well, but the people that have been presented to us are not people who, on the basis of any authority that they may have demonstrated in their past work, can actually say to the national supervisory authorities where they would stand in the event of a conflict. Where there is European supervision, national momentum comes to a standstill. That surprises and annoys us, and it must call us into action. No, these procedures are unsatisfactory, and I ask myself why, for example, we cannot take the same approach as we are taking with regard to those responsible for OLAF, where you are of course interested in the opinion of this House. Why can we not do that? We still have another opportunity with regard to the executive directors. You can still demonstrate that you are interested in the opinion of the European Parliament. You still have another opportunity. I would urge you both – President-in-Office of the Council and former fellow Member Mrs Győri and Commissioner Barnier, to take this opportunity. You can take on board the objections of this House. You can tell us very clearly how you want to work with us in future. You can tell us very clearly what goals you will support in the 2013 reform and how you will equip the institutions. You will also be able to make it very clear whether you are interested in our opinion in respect of those members of staff that are still to be appointed. I therefore ask you in all earnestness in the interests of Europe to provide these rules quickly. Udo Bullmann  (S&amp;D

 Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, in critical situations, Europe has always found a way out of a crisis. Not because different interests have been played off against one another, but because we have combined our interests, which has allowed us to take new paths. I would have liked to ask Mr Barroso a question, but unfortunately he is no longer here. There will, of course, soon be important press conferences on the subject of how we can rescue Europe using the lowest common denominator, but Mr Rehn may be able to pass my question on. I do not understand why we are not taking the following route. Eurobonds are a sensible solution. Mr Schulz has said that on behalf of our group and, in Germany, where this is a critical issue, my party is saying the same thing. The German Government in particular has reservations and there are also reservations in other countries which are paying less interest. Why do we not proceed as follows? We are saying that these problems can be solved. We are now planning to launch eurobonds, but we are putting together a sensible package. What do we need to enable Europe to act? How can we put money into the coffers? How can we create more taxation potential for a sensible, long-term economy? We are launching eurobonds and we are linking this launch with the introduction of the financial transaction tax in the European Union. This package could result in a win-win situation, which would enable everyone to benefit. Ask Mrs Merkel at the European summit if she is prepared to do this. Why is it not possible? Why does the Commission not make a proposal of this kind? It would help everyone and enable a major new project for Europe to emerge from the crisis. I am waiting for the Commission to make this proposal. You must stop trying to talk your way out of it. It is time for you to act in the interest of the citizens of Europe and in the interest of the Member States, so that we can find our way back to a sensible path of growth. Our fate is in your hands, but you must have the courage to take the initiative now. Udo Bullmann,

 Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, in her speech this morning, Mrs Harms posed the question of why the spark is no longer being passed from the summits to the people and why new courage and new confidence is not emanating from the summit discussions. As I listened to you this morning and also just now, Mr Barroso, and to Mr Van Rompuy or the Council, too, I got an idea of why the spark is not being passed on. The spark is not even passing into the Chamber here – just look around you. Of course, it is important for more Members to be here. Why are they not here? It is wrong for them not to be here. However, they are not really hearing anything new anyway. You are telling us things that have already been said in the newspapers many times and you are not providing answers to the very pointed questions that have been asked. What is happening with regard to the financial transaction tax? Mr Schulz has asked about this many times. Where is the answer? It is not on the agenda of the G20 summit in Seoul. I would like an explanation. I would also like to know why the European Council, the Belgian Presidency, said that it is in favour of this, but why the European Council at its last three summits merely said that it recommended a feasibility study at global level but not at European level. Why ever not? Does the Council not see the dead end into which you are directing this matter? I will ask you once again, Mr Barroso: when will Mr Šemeta comply with the demand made by this Parliament at the beginning of this year, namely that we want a feasibility study for Europe, too? If you present an opinion on this subject, this Chamber will actually be full and we will listen to you. However, do not avoid the issue any longer. For Europe alone we are talking about EUR 200 billion per year. Ask the Members who belong to the Committee on Budgets what trivial, small amounts they are currently arguing about with the Council. With an initiative we would make progress. We need to breathe life into the roles, then the spark will once again be passed on. That is what we expect from you. Udo Bullmann  (S&amp;D

 Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, as I listen to this debate, I have to admit that it reminds me very much of the debate on the Services Directive. I will tell you why. In that case, too, my fellow Members from the Group of the Greens/European Free Alliance and the Confederal Group of the European United Left – Nordic Green Left declared that there was a regulation on the table in this House that was not perfect, not complete, and yet for years now, they have been grateful for the fact that the Group of the Progressive Alliance of Socialists and Democrats in the European Parliament managed to push it through in this House. That is the truth about this regulation that we will vote on tomorrow. In fact, the improvement made on what the Council and Commission proposed can essentially be attributed to Mr Goebbels and Mrs Regner, who fought for improvements here against the opposition, with the support and excellent cooperation of Mr Gauzès, for which I would like to thank him. In my country, Germany, what we have agreed here for the private equity industry will bring about real improvements for workers and for small and medium-sized enterprises, which no longer need to be afraid of simply being eaten up by the black sheep of the equity industry that do not abide by any standards. These days, when we read and listen to the press telling us that the funds industry is moving its focus away from the Caribbean and towards Europe because it is important to long-term investors that there are good products in which to invest, that supports the work of this Parliament rather than running counter to it. However, before we talk too much about dynamism here, I have to say that my group has been calling for a regulation since 2002. Perhaps there has been evidence of dynamism, but only in the last few weeks. I would like to thank the President-in-Office of the Council and the Commissioner, as you have personally supplied this dynamism. Please tell your colleagues in the Council that, with this method of sluggishness, of ‘yes, but’ and the refusal to put through better regulations in Europe, we will not succeed in getting the next pieces of legislation on derivatives or short selling through. This situation has to change. That is an appeal from this Parliament. Udo Bullmann  (S&amp;D

 Mr President, Mr Chastel, Commissioner, this could actually have been a time of great answers, but in hindsight, it does not look like it. What is on the table for the so-called reform of the Stability and Growth Pact is no great answer; once again, it is the lowest common denominator – the small morsel that could actually be agreed upon. I congratulate the Commission. You are still at the table – the Member States are not quite going it alone. I also congratulate the Council. Success has been achieved, France and Germany have an agreement – we do not know whether it is a good one or a bad one, but at least they are no longer stuck in the quagmire. What does all this mean? It means that next year, if the growth figures collapse again, we will stand up in front of everyone and have no answer to the economic situation. Where is the section, the legal statute, in which you propose how we can together learn to drag ourselves out of the debt crisis? That is where my group feels there is a gap and that is the debate that we are going to have in this House. Yes, we agree with those Members who want greater commitment to reform. That is something that we want too. However, we then need to discuss the substance. If you are not prepared to provide a more solid foundation for the actual orientation of our budgetary policy, then we can see no reason to continue discussing EU 2020. It is already a paper tiger – we can throw it in the waste paper basket today if you will not debate the substance of it with us more forcefully. We want to make a difference. Yes, it makes a difference whether we invest in limping bureaucracy or in the energy sources and jobs of the future. Where is the point in your proposals where we can make this difference? That is what we are waiting for. This debate has yet to take place. That will be the decisive thing for us. Moreover, we will not accept a catalogue of indicators that is based on the legislation. This Parliament will not have the wool pulled over its eyes. We want to debate whether employment and unemployment are an important feature of budgetary development or not, and we want to do so before the legislation is passed. Udo Bullmann,  
on behalf of the S&amp;D Group.

 Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, let me just point one thing out before I start. The Basel Committee is a group of more or less intelligent central bankers and overseers, but it is certainly no infallible council of wise men and it is definitely not the law. This House is the legislative body – Commissioner, you know that, and we know that you do – and this legislative body will pay close attention to what is put on the table and, where it makes sense, to what is put on the table here, too. Clearly, we do want the rules on capital requirements to be tightened up. How could we not want that, in the wake of the economic crisis in which we still find ourselves? 20 to 30% of the gross national product of our national economies are in pawn as the rescue package for the banks. The people expect us, of course, to make respectable banking rules so that we do not find ourselves in a crisis like this one again. Clearly, we want there to be counter-cyclical elements in this banking safeguard like those, for example, that have already been proving their worth in Spain for years. Although there, too, they had to be implemented in the face of opposition, they are paying off today because they were implemented at an appropriately early point and they did not make the banking system worse; they made it more robust. There are key issues, though, and I am truly grateful to the rapporteur, Mr Karas, for having put these key issues at the heart of his own-initiative report, which we find ourselves absolutely and totally able to support. The first of these is that, yes, indeed, we do need an impact study, specifically a complex impact study that makes it clear what the impact is, for one thing, on the financial sector in all its parts but also, of course, in particular, what the impact is on the real economy. What is the impact on the issue of what the future actually holds for loan financing conditions for small and medium-sized enterprises? The second issue is that we need the certainty that this time, unlike in the past, the agreements will also be implemented in other territories. We need to know that before we legislate, as otherwise there will be a new asymmetry for which we cannot be responsible. The third issue is that there can be no discrimination in terms of legal forms. Those forms among the diversity of the European banking system that particularly proved themselves during the financial crisis – and that means those banks that looked after the small and medium-sized business sector and those banks that were focusing on private customers and thus did not elicit cross-border risks – must not be penalised for the solidarity of their establishment. The proposal on the table at the moment does not do enough to ensure this. We therefore believe that the proposals need to now be improved and that we need to consider how we can tackle this issue in practical terms. Public banking overall is of major value, provided it can be run on a sensible basis. We do also need to ask – and I am thinking here about silent partnership reserves – how this will actually be effected in future, if we buy the regulations as they are envisaged in Basel. This cannot be the last word, nor is it the final version that we will accept. The capital instruments need to be measured in order to see the extent to which they ensure consistent quality without false provisos, are available to absorb losses, are durable and flexible in terms of payment, as the rapporteur also argues in his report. It is a reasonable starting position for us to take. We want the leverage effects to be limited and reasonable allowance to be made for the different risk profiles. We will examine your proposal, therefore, Commissioner, and we hope for the best of cooperation with Parliament. Udo Bullmann,  
on behalf of the S&amp;D Group.

Madam President, Mr Reynders, Commissioner, congratulations on your supervision. Parliament has worked hard on this issue and you have also played your part, which is why the results are so good. We must always look to new tasks and, unfortunately, I must point out that good results are still a long way off in other areas. Let me just say that the regulation of hedge fund managers is still nowhere near a breakthrough. At this point, I would call on both sides, both the Council and the Commission, to get cracking. After all, without your efforts, the regulations will not be of much use. We need equal rights for all. Managers outside the European Union must always be subject to the same conditions as their European counterparts. Otherwise, we are putting Europe at a disadvantage. It is not our aim to put a whole industry behind bars. However, if we do not achieve meaningful improvements that will prevent the black sheep from plundering well-functioning businesses, we are not going to have good regulation. I want to issue this warning: you should not imagine that you will score an easy victory by simply playing the various Members of this House off against each other. If you fail to introduce effective regulation, the whole of Europe will know who it was who went down on bended knee before the lobbyists and that knowledge will give these discussions a different character. A word about the financial transaction tax: My view of this is diametrically opposed to that of the Group of the European People’s Party (Christian Democrats). Europe is waiting for answers. You will have to provide these answers. Do not come back from the G20 summit and tell us: ‘Unfortunately we have achieved nothing, so now there is nothing we can do.’ On the contrary, we need to take action in Europe, which is why we need to plan and implement some decisive measures together with the people in Europe. Remember one thing during your negotiations at the G20 summit: we need a response from you, otherwise there is going to have to be a European response. Udo Bullmann  (S&amp;D

Madam President, as the coordinator for the Group of the Progressive Alliance of Socialists and Democrats in the European Parliament, I would like to make a comment on Amendment 6. I would like to call on my group to vote in favour of Amendment 6, in contrast to what appears on our voting recommendations. This is a mistake in the list. We should vote for Amendment 6 and this is likely to clarify the way in which we will vote now in a decisive situation. Udo Bullmann  (S&amp;D

 Mr President, Mr López Garrido, ladies and gentlemen, I would like to ask you to pass on a message to the other members of the Council. The time for the policy of excuses is over. It is important that you do not decide tomorrow that Parliament should adopt the supervisory package and the hedge funds package more quickly as part of the regulation of the financial markets, while the Council – and I do not mean you personally, Mr López Garrido, but I want to encourage you to help us – simultaneously puts on the brakes and prevents us from finding solutions. The trialogue of the Council, the Commission and Parliament is meeting in this House at the same time to discuss the issue of regulating hedge funds. We have proposed appropriate regulations, which prevent the finance industry from gobbling up industrial firms using speculative funds and bringing the real economy to its knees. However, the Council is blocking these regulations. Please tell the Heads of State or Government that the time for the policy of excuses is long gone. It is no longer acceptable for them to give big speeches at home about the regulations that Europe can introduce and then to chicken out when their officials begin working at a European level. The time for this is past and we can no longer afford to behave in this way in the context of the economic crisis. I would like to ask you the same question, Mr Barroso. It does not matter whether you are mentioning the word ‘growth’ here for the 49th, 52nd or 64th time. It is much more important for you to explain why it is that, as the Economic and Financial Affairs Council (Ecofin) stated the day before yesterday, the Member States of the European Union will have to make huge cuts amounting to 3.5% of their gross national product, but you are not telling us how you will use this money to prevent a dreadful catastrophe on the labour market. In this situation, we must learn to grow together. However, you need to explain how this will happen. Otherwise, the Europe 2020 strategy will not be worth the paper it is written on. We need real answers instead of fictitious answers and excuses in order to ensure that the institutions which you represent are part of the solution and not part of the problem. Udo Bullmann  (S&amp;D

 Mr President, Mr López Garrido, ladies and gentlemen, I have a very specific question which will allow us to emerge from the position of powerlessness and confusion that the crisis has left us in, with no one knowing how the crisis arose and how we can find our way out of it. Mr Schulz has referred to the highly critical speculative products and credit default insurance and to the damaging practice of short selling, which brought Greece to the brink of disaster and could represent a major problem for Portugal and many other countries. Mr López Garrido, you have frequently attended the Economic and Financial Affairs Council (Ecofin) in recent months, why was it not possible for the Member States to take concerted action to ban these products? I have been asking this question in the capital of my own country over recent weeks and months and it has taken you months, in fact until yesterday evening, to introduce a ban on the damaging practice of short selling. I ask myself why we have to wait until things have gone wrong before making use of the appropriate legislative measures, which are already in place, to protect the people and the economies of Europe. I believe it has something to do with the Council’s dreadful, discouraging slowness to act, which you have referred to. I will make a deal with you. We in the European Parliament are presenting concrete proposals. In the context of regulating the supervisory bodies and the discussion about hedge funds, we have proposed that we should take appropriate measures on a European level and we will make the same resolution on derivatives, if you, Mr Langen, do what you are always saying. We are calling on you urgently to ensure that the Council finally begins to work with us to put in place legislation so that we in Europe are able to act and no longer have to wait for ever for the Council to make a move. We need to have the tools at our disposal in Europe to enable us to make progress. Please help to make sure that this happens in the Council. However, the decisive point is that the Council must take action on the legislation. Udo Bullmann  (S&amp;D
).

 Madam President, Mr Hökmark, I think we have been in different parliaments in recent years, because the parliament I have experienced is different to yours! I have experienced a parliament in which some say we must look more closely into ratings agencies, hedge funds and private equity corporations. We must regulate them, we must carry out checks on the critical players in the financial markets and the critical products to ensure that we are not veering towards an international fiasco. I have also heard others saying ‘hands off’: the market will regulate itself, we do not need all that. Or as Mr McCreevy said – whenever politics interferes, the result is always worse. We have seen the results. The international fiasco is the cause of the overindebtedness of the Member States of the European Union. However, we cannot stand here today and say that it was wrong to focus our growth policy on employment and economic activity. It is irrelevant to the debate, just as it is irrelevant to the debate when Mr Langen says that Chancellor Merkel understood the European Treaty. No, she did not understand it at all. What is worse, she is probably in a position to subordinate the European Treaty and its aims for Europe to her fear of losing an important regional election in North Rhine-Westphalia. These are not the leadership skills that we need in the European Union. We have told the Commission here that EU 2020 is too watered down. There is no meat in it. Please provide some evidence that you are able to acquire new funds. Please fight for a financial transactions tax. Please fight for more economic activity and greater growth prospects in the European Union, to give small and medium-sized enterprises and the workers a chance. Right now, however, we almost sympathise with you for having to save the European Union with governments such as we have at present – governments such as that represented by Chancellor Merkel. Stay strong and create European instruments! That is our main message for the summit, because only then can people hope that we will provide the right answers. Udo Bullmann,

Mr President, Commissioner, I would like to chip in with a few questions on what Mr Scicluna has stated on behalf of the Committee. Commissioner, if there are 70, 80, 90 or 100 times as many financial transactions in the world as gross national product, and if this development is becoming ever more dynamic, would you then say speculative elements are, for the greater part, linked to this explosion of financial products? If so, how do you then plan to curb them, or what might contribute to curbing them? If short-term financial transactions increase more and more relative to gross national product in the world, do you then share our view that we must strengthen the long-term approach in the real economy, where people work, earn money and manufacture products that we can consume and that we can use. If you share this opinion, by what way and means do you believe will we then be able to achieve this? Commissioner, if the tax on financial transactions can make a contribution to this – that is what we want to look into – what would the timeframe be for negotiating this with international partners? We have the impression that the financial instruments that were created in the world are being used right now to speculate against the euro area and against the euro and to act against the weakest Member States. Is it not high time now that we dealt with this and define a European approach? Commissioner, there is one thing I cannot understand, namely why we are urging Member States to raise value added tax by three or four or more percentage points, when a transaction tax of 0.01 or 0.05 percentage points will supposedly ruin competition and weaken Europe’s position. I cannot believe that. Take action. That is what Parliament wishes. Udo Bullmann,

Mr President, Commissioner, the Single Euro Payments Area is an important, indeed central, instrument of the European single market. It is thanks to Mr Gauzès that we have got it off the ground. My group is fully behind it and would like to see it working well. I personally also have nothing against us setting a deadline for the migration, and here to me it is not so much a question of whether it takes three, four or five months as the fact that it then actually works. Whether it actually works depends on two things. Firstly the appeal to industry that it must be end-user friendly. These days, we cannot afford any rumours, any secret resistance, any hankering after the old system. Therefore, it must be functioning properly, also in respect of those who ultimately have to use it. Secondly, it must, of course, also work for the benefit of the economy. Here I would like to mention one point, which is still a bone of contention, namely the matter of how direct debits will be calculated. Here, the economy does not yet seem to be in a position to propose a sensible model. There are still snags, there are still sticking points and if the economy is not in a position to present a common model that works within the European Union, then the Commission – as stipulated in this proposal for a resolution – must present a concrete proposal within a certain period of time, let us say before the end of the year. It should not be the case that we confront the economy and demand a deadline for the migration, but do not take the initiative to remove the resistance that the payment service providers are obviously not in the position to overcome single-handedly. We need a community initiative here, so the whole thing can work. That is our approach to the discussion. Udo Bullmann  (S&amp;D

 Madam President, President of the European Council, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, I would like to briefly address two points. Firstly, do we already have a Europe 2020 strategy that promises success? No, as yet, we do not. I will tell you why. If, in the Commission and the Member States, you say that we will first carry out a rapid consolidation of the budgets and then deal with the economy and employment, then this is a miscalculation. If you do not believe us, read the statement issued by the International Monetary Fund yesterday. Private sector demand is a long way from recovery. We are concerned about public investment. If you do not pursue an integrated strategy with specific employment goals at the centre, we will have no chance of dealing with the crisis. Secondly, do we have an answer to the debt crisis in the countries that are under the most pressure? No, as yet we do not. More than one country has made mistakes. However, if you read the data carefully and listen to the analysts, then you know that at least half of the Greek excesses are the fault of speculators – the speculators that, for five years, the Commission did not want to regulate – the hedge funds. Now we are finally doing that, but what does it actually mean in practice? We need a European monetary fund, a fund to help these countries. We need to be able to offer credit at sensible rates not only outside the euro area, but within it, too, with conditions attached. However, we need to establish a European policy to solve the crisis – and we need to do so now. Udo Bullmann,  
on behalf of the S&amp;D Group.

Madam President, Mr Almunia, during this transition period in particular, I thank you for your commitment to your previous mandate and I wish you luck in your new role. I would also like to extend this wish to your successor, Mr Rehn. I wish him courage and luck for the important tasks he is taking on. There are three things we can learn from the present situation. The first is that what Mr Barroso has presented to us as Europe 2020 is lacking in substance. It is a long way from being sufficient to create the coherence in the European Union that we urgently need in order to prevent the situation that we are currently facing from occurring again in the future. This strategy needs substance, and I hope that the scheduled milestones in the next few weeks will provide the opportunity to improve on it. We urgently need better coordination of economic policy. The Spanish Presidency is right to emphasise this. The Presidency should not allow itself to be intimidated in this regard. The second thing we can learn from the current situation is that some Member States are, of course, in need of modernisation and the figures are surely correct in this regard. However, there is a need for modernisation in more than one country. There are also countries that have to do more, because they are able to do more. I have no doubt that the new Greek Finance Minister, Mr Papakonstantinou, will do an excellent job and I do not know any sincere politicians who would dispute that. He deserves our trust and we should give him our support. The third thing we can learn is that the European Union must be armed. If the markets put the euro area to the test, then Europe must be a position to respond to this and it must be possible for the response to be unconventional. If there is further speculation against individual countries, we must be in a position to make credit available under average European rating terms. That will need to be organised. We can find support for this kind of action in the Treaty of Lisbon. I would say to the Council and the Commission: be prepared for the need to negotiate. Udo Bullmann  (S&amp;D

 Mr President, even as we today congratulate Mrs Alvarez, Mr Domenici and our other fellow members on their excellent reports, even as we congratulate Commissioner Kovács on his committed work and wish him all the best with his future work, and even as we express the hope that he will pass on to his successor the passion with which he has fought for a common tax policy, we must also then mention Member States, those Member States who continue to hesitate in taking action that is more than necessary in this crisis situation, action which will finally usher in better cooperation. It is quite shocking that we still have not made any breakthrough on the question of the tax base. Anyone who thinks that they will be able to defend their sovereignty in this way will lose it, just as they will lose their tax revenue. Therefore, the main message of these reports is that we must forge better cooperation in Europe. Only that will lead to progress! Udo Bullmann,  
on behalf of the S&amp;D Group. 
– (DE) 
Mr President, President-in-Office of the Council, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, first and foremost, there can be no ‘as you were’ in the current economic situation. That will only allow us to make a slow recovery and we shall see a further dramatic increase in unemployment figures, including here in Europe. You must therefore be bold. That is the most important message this Parliament can give the Pittsburgh delegates. Be bold! Mr Almunia, I have listened to a refreshing speech from you, on which I should like to congratulate you. Now you need to start putting it into practice. It is good to start with the bonus systems, but it is not enough. We need a gear shift wherever short-term speculators are at an advantage on the international financial market, because the rules are wrong, over those who wish to make long-term investments in jobs, in products of excellence and in the long-term success of their company. It is right to say that no risky players, no risky financial centre can remain without reasonable regulation, which is why we need regulation of the offshore centres from which dubious products are flooding the entire world. That is the most important task that we must now set ourselves. Nor should you be frightened of discussing fiscal policy – it is not prohibited. A global transaction tax which benefits long-term investors would take us forward in this discussion as a whole. We need strong, improved coordination of our international, as well as our European, economic policy. It is right to think about an exit strategy, but it is even more important at the moment that we work out how we can give more solid support to the economy and improve the coordination of our economic policy. Udo Bullmann,  
on behalf of the S&amp;D Group.

 Mr President, Commissioners, ladies and gentlemen, in this situation, where, after a struggle that has gone on for months, the way is finally open to a solution in which, of the in excess of 50 000 directly-affected jobs, probably – at least according to what the new investors are telling us – around 40 000 can be saved, not counting the many jobs amongst suppliers and in dependent local businesses, it is now time to address the workforce of General Motors in Europe. It was their dispute, they – Klaus Franz as the Chairman of the Full Works Council and all the others – became the face of Opel Europe, from a new technology group that has earned its opportunity, and in such a situation, our policy must help. What is it that we are discussing? We are discussing how General Motors in the US staggered on for months. It came within a whisker – and we know this for certain, ladies and gentlemen – of failing. What, then, could have been more reasonable than to have seized the initiative, moved forwards and said, ‘OK then. We have to jump in here and give people a chance. We must give not just the production sites, but also the future technologies, a chance so that Europe can remain a good place to produce cars.’ I can fully identify with the outlook that Commissioner Špidla set out for the European car industry. Let us make it real! Let us create an industrial policy framework with world-leading environmental standards so that employees and car makers in Europe can develop within them right here. We managed it before with coal and steel. Why should we not also now succeed in doing it for the industry of mobility and the future? Grab the ball! The Commission has a lot of room to act here, and it can launch a lot of initiatives. Commissioner Kroes, according to my information, of the 4.5 billion that form part of the deal that has to be reached, you have already approved 1.5 billion so that the wheels keep turning. Naturally, you must check the law and the legislation – what is the alternative? Of course, all necessary steps must be taken to bring about a fair distribution of burdens in the future negotiations. I implore you, however, to conduct your checks quickly, to consistently come to a conclusion but, given what is at stake, it is absolutely vital that this opportunity not be destroyed. It must not fail on trivialities. Instead, we must also note the significance of the situation and we must achieve a European solution, in the public interest, that benefits everyone.

Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, with our report on small-scale fishing, we are underlining the fact that we are sensitive to the needs of traditional and artisanal fishermen and listen to their concerns. Traditional fishing produces more jobs and less CO2
 per kilo of catch than industrial fishing. The small-scale fishing lobby, however, is weaker. That is why we must be vigilant and ensure that it is not put at a disadvantage in the allocation of quotas, for example. We will also be voting tomorrow on Parliament’s position on the external dimension of the Common Fisheries Policy. This report is intended to form the basis for our future decisions, for example on fisheries agreements. I am pleased that with one exception, all groups were able to agree on a text.  A minority has now drafted a resolution which I hope will be rejected by a majority of the House. The comments that have been made about shark-finning give me cause for optimism. Here, the PPE appears to be endorsing the majority opinion, albeit at the last minute. Shark-finning must be banned in the EU at long last, without any legal loopholes. Ulrike Rodust  (S&amp;D

 Mr President, Mr Cioloş, ladies and gentlemen, we are in the middle of reforming the common agricultural policy and Parliament, in its new role of colegislator, will tomorrow adopt the first regulation from the reform package on the application of direct payments for the transitional year 2013. This is a positive development and an important moment. I would particularly like to thank the rapporteur, Mr Capoulas Santos, for his very good work which, most importantly, was completed quickly. This regulation must come into force on 1 January 2014 to ensure that there are no financing problems during the transition from the current regulation to the next reformed regulation on direct payments. Therefore, it was particularly important for Parliament and the Council to reach an agreement quickly. Continuity in financing is a decisive factor for the Member States. This is why it is so important that the transitional regulation for 2013 comes into force at the right time. The current regulation on direct payments remains valid in 2013, but some of the financial provisions in the regulation only apply until 2012. I welcome the solution identified by Parliament and the Council, and particularly the transfer from Pillar 1 to Pillar 2. Ulrike Rodust  (S&amp;D

 Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I welcome the fact that we are drawing attention to the animal disease caused by the Schmallenberg virus today through this oral question, as it shows that we take this issue seriously. Many farmers have been waiting desperately for this moment. As you have already heard, 944 holdings have already been hit by the Schmallenberg virus in Germany alone. This has caused huge problems for these farms. Because of its proximity to the coast and the protection of its dykes, my own region of Schleswig-Holstein has a large number of sheep farmers. Many sheep have been infected with this virus. The virus threatens the survival of many farming businesses, particularly at present in the lambing season. The number of cases continues to rise. Both sheep and beef farmers are suffering from the effects of this virus in Schleswig-Holstein. In the last week alone, the number of cases in my region has risen from 106 farms with infected animals last week to 116 farms this week. Even though the virus does not pose a threat to humans, farming businesses are suffering serious financial losses due to deformities and still-births. I would also like to draw your attention to the suffering of the animals. I believe that this is also something unacceptable. We urgently need a vaccine. I would be interested to know what progress has been made by researchers in this regard and whether the Commission is supporting Member States in the search for a vaccine. Perhaps we should also consider whether it is possible to help the farms that have been financially hit by the virus in some other way. What options are open to the Commission here and what steps have already been taken? Please act quickly and keep us informed of developments. Our farmers are counting on you, and on us.

 Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, what are we dealing with here today? We are trying to adopt multi-annual plans for our fishing stocks in order to bring an end to overfishing in our seas. Multi-annual plans are the key tool in our fisheries policy. The fish in question today, the Atlantic horse mackerel, is just one example of many. We aim to produce management plans for all commercially fished species. Almost exactly 16 months ago, we were here in the House and Parliament adopted its position on this multi-annual plan. We have had the attempt to negotiate with the Council. Unfortunately nothing came of the talks, as the fisheries ministers within the Union apparently would like to work without involving Parliament when it comes to important issues. Over the past 16 months, the Council has not budged an inch. It has demonstrated complete obstinacy, a quality that is not a bad one to have in politics, but in this case it is scandalous. The Council has ensured that there are absolutely no new long-term management plans in place. It is as if the tug of war between the institutions were more important than a sensible policy for our fishermen, for our environment and for our citizens. If we want people to be satisfied with the European Union, we must deliver results. In the area of fisheries policy, we have not done that for two years now. In the past, European fisheries policy was in the sole hands of the Council of Ministers. Unfortunately, the result was a disaster. That the ministers should now have the idea of continuing to make policy without Parliament’s involvement seems, against that backdrop, to be something of a bad joke! If we were to actually negotiate with one another about the reform of the common fisheries policy the citizens of the European Union would also observe who was going into bat for a progressive policy and who was putting the brakes on. Ministers, please take a look at yourselves and then manoeuvre yourselves out of this dead end as soon as possible. Ulrike Rodust  (S&amp;D

 Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, I welcome the approach taken in the regulation on contractual relations in the milk sector of strengthening the negotiating position of milk producers and ensuring fairer prices. It is important that we do not leave the milk producers high and dry once the milk quotas are abolished. Small and medium-sized family businesses, in particular, rely on the fact that they are supported by the European Union and not left unprotected at the mercy of the milk purchasers and retailers. I would have liked for us to have introduced mandatory contracts at Member State level. However, the Council and the Commission fought tooth and nail against the idea. It is a shame that the Council is not here now. I believe that the compromise that has now been reached is acceptable, but it does not go far enough. Therefore, we must ensure that the interests of small and medium-sized milk producers, in particular, are taken into consideration in the upcoming reform of the common agricultural policy. My main concern will continue to be fighting for a sustainable and multi-functional agriculture that covers the whole of Europe. Ulrike Rodust  (S&amp;D

 Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I am very pleased to see this topic addressed in plenary and I would like to offer my thanks to Mr Bové. It really is a very important issue that we are debating today, be it for producers, processors, for trade or for consumers. Production costs for farmers have risen sharply over recent years. Farmers can primarily feel the increasing overheads when it comes to energy bills and agricultural inputs. The heavy concentration of food retailing, above all, makes it more difficult for producers to obtain good prices for their products. Although the mark-up between the primary and the end product is sometimes considerable, not much of that reaches producers, as some of the margin is lost to each of the various processing steps. Politicians can intervene in competition policy, but we must be careful when doing so, and, in certain areas, we have to trust to market forces. I consider it important to let consumers know that buying regional products from their producers or makers supports both the farmers and the local economy. That is where I see our role. We should intervene in this connection, be it with money or with political instruments. I believe strengthening regionalism provides a tool to do this. In the reform of the common agricultural policy, we need to make other tools available. For me as a Social Democrat, it is important that access to wholesome food at reasonable prices should be guaranteed for all, while, at the same time, farmers must be able to receive a fair and reasonable income for their work. This demand requires us not to shirk our responsibility, and indeed to live up to it. Every time we act, we need to ask ourselves if we are living up to these demands. If not, the result will be social unrest in the long run. Farmers and consumers are in the same boat. Let us ensure that that boat never sinks. Ulrike Rodust,

 Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, this House has now been dealing with the fisheries agreement between the European Union and Morocco for over a year, and I am sure that tomorrow’s vote will not be the end of it. This agreement has become a highly emotive issue. The whole of Parliament is talking about the agreement; the debate has been a matter of controversy within all the groups in recent days and weeks. This is a fisheries agreement that needs careful analysis. What is the result of such analysis? Those of us who are members of the Committee on Fisheries are agreed that this agreement is not ecologically sustainable, because it contributes to overfishing. I regret to say that this has rather been forgotten in the debate so far, but nonetheless it is a key point. In view of the catastrophic state of the world’s seas, the European Union should not be allowed to overfish its own waters, much less waters belonging to third countries. This protocol also has no economic merit. There is no win-win situation for us. In addition, there remains the Western Sahara question. I am sure we are agreed that the agreement must be in accordance with international law. The current protocol on which we are going to vote has all these shortcomings. For this reason, it is not possible to vote in favour of it. We are now being consoled with the idea that it will all change in the future. I hope that is so, and that our resolution will help the Council and the Commission to get things right in the negotiations with Morocco. The only convincing reason for voting in favour is that the protocol is about to expire and the Commission has asked us not to bring about a break in it, because that would make the new negotiations more difficult. It assures us that all our demands will be incorporated into the new protocol. Not only is that something I am expecting, but indeed I am relying on it being the case. Ulrike Rodust  (S&amp;D

 Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, illegal fishing poses a serious threat to our fish stocks and to all honest fishermen, who are being swindled out of part of their income. At this point, I would like to take the unusual step of praising the Council of Ministers, which succeeded in agreeing an IUU regulation before the Treaty of Lisbon came into force, in other words, without our cooperation. That was an important step forward. However, Ms Lövin’s excellent report makes it clear that there is still a lot of work to do. Illegal fishing is a typical example of problems that are so big that the European Union cannot deal with them on its own. We need global solutions. The fact is that global solutions require effective global institutions. As the rapporteur on reform of the common fisheries policy, I would like to close with the following remark: the best protection against illegal fishing is afforded by fishermen who know the rules and who are convinced that these make sense. This must be our guiding principle in pursuing new reforms. Ulrike Rodust  (S&amp;D

 Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I would like to make one thing clear in advance. As a Social Democrat, it is important to me to help needy people. However, for me the focus is primarily on creating jobs, in order to enable people to take care of themselves. In my opinion, the food aid programme for needy people in its current form is not the right way of helping people to help themselves. I see this as charity, which is damaging to people’s dignity. It seems relatively clear to me that buying food and distributing it free of charge to needy people is not agricultural policy. It falls within the realms of social policy. Under the terms of the current legal basis, social policy is a matter for the Member States. In Germany there is a system of food banks. Volunteer helpers collect food which can no longer be used by supermarkets, for example. Given the fact that 89 million tonnes of food goes to landfill every year in Europe, initiatives of this kind make sense, but they are also charitable in nature. Let us create sensible infrastructures to ensure that people do not have to rely on charity. This means, for example, allowing them to be independent by providing good jobs and good pensions. Ulrike Rodust  (S&amp;D

 Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, I would like to thank the rapporteur and I am pleased that the report bears unmistakably socialist, social democratic hallmarks. We want a sustainable, ecological and social agricultural policy. We want greening and we want it in the first pillar. Cross-compliance and the agro-environmental measures of the system to date are not enough to achieve support for the whole of society, but that is precisely what we need. Our primary objective must be to ensure high-quality and sustainable food production in Europe and for our rural areas to be active and vital. We absolutely have to stop the increasing land abandonment, because we need people. People to look after the agricultural sector, as well as the areas upstream and downstream. The rumours emanating from the Commission concerning plans for massive cuts in rural development in the next multiannual financial framework are not acceptable. We must continue to work for a strong second pillar in the common agricultural policy (CAP), for rural areas and for Europe. I would like to issue a general warning to anyone intending to cut agricultural funding. If this is done, there will be no reform. Everything will then stay the same as it is. That will be quite inexplicable to the citizens of Europe. Ulrike Rodust  (S&amp;D

 Mr President, Commissioner, I come from the region of Europe where the outbreak of the EHEC pathogen is at its raging worst. This aggressive bacteria seems unstoppable. Between mid-May and noon yesterday, 1 733 people were infected, while 23 patients died a torturous death. The situation in the clinics is extremely fraught. Intensive care beds are running out, and blood plasma is needed urgently. No end is in sight. The people of my home area fear new cases every day. For me, it is a question of courage and a sense of responsibility to warn about every even potential carrier of this bacterium. Various foodstuffs have been analysed, but it has not been found. My understanding of high grade foodstuffs is that they are healthy and that they are placed on the market subject to monitoring. I am presuming that glaring errors have been made in this regard, and once again, we are finding out that there are loopholes. However, to claim, in this situation, that the cause is known, without having well-founded laboratory research to back it up, is negligent in the extreme. In all the understandable panic, there must not, under any circumstances, be a witch-hunt, as that would drive many hard-working farmers throughout Europe to the wall. It therefore needs to be clear to everyone that we in the European Union need to show solidarity with one another and stand ready to provide mutual assistance in the event of emergencies. In other words, all the medical experts must sit down together, and economic assistance needs to be provided to those who innocently find themselves facing financial disaster. Ulrike Rodust  (S&amp;D

 Madam President, Mr Andor, ladies and gentlemen, we must do everything we can to counteract the spread of antibiotic resistance. We are in complete agreement on this. This involves the responsible use of antibiotics in human medicine and in animal husbandry. The European Union must take determined action. We must not allow 25 000 people to go on dying from infections caused by resistant bacteria every year in the European Union alone. Antibiotics must not be used routinely or preventively. We must ensure that antibiotics are used responsibly in all the Member States. It is of the utmost importance that every possible effort is made to keep livestock healthy from the rearing stage onwards, until they are fully grown. Ensuring that animals are healthy is the best means of avoiding infection and the use of antibiotics. The way the animals are fed is decisive in this respect, but the husbandry is also important. We should also be open to the use of alternative methods, such as homeopathy and phytotherapy, in livestock husbandry. We need more research and more information in Europe about these alternative approaches. Ulrike Rodust  (S&amp;D

Madam President, open borders are an important symbol for Europe. I would like to draw your attention to another problem. I come from Northern Germany, which is why the German-Danish border is of particular importance for me. The right-wing populist Danish People’s Party is trying to force the Danish Government to reintroduce border controls. What is the reason for this? It is a fear of people from Romania and Bulgaria. This is scandalous. The right-wing populists are rapidly growing in numbers and represent a real danger for Europe. Of course we must have protections against untrammelled criminality and our security authorities have already found effective alternatives to passport controls. It makes me very sad that one of our major European achievements is to be put at risk. The EU success in promoting peace and freedom is without historical parallel but is now under high-level attack. I would call on the Danish Government not to allow itself to be dictated to by the right-wing populists. Ulrike Rodust,

 Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, European fisheries are in a state of deep crisis, as my fellow Members have said. Fishermen in all European seas complain about the painful drop in income, which may be severe enough to threaten their existence. Yet, why is the income of our fishermen decreasing? As far as I can see, there are three reasons for this. Firstly, there is the decline in fish stocks; secondly, the general fall in prices in precisely the area where fish stocks are healthy and supply is too high; and thirdly – and this is what we are concerned about today – operating costs are higher as a result of rising crude oil prices. We politicians need to step in here. We must do what we can to help. I would stress that we can only do what we can. The motion for a resolution tabled by the Group of the European People’s Party (Christian Democrats) promises more than we can deliver. It demands an increase of 100% in the de minimis
 aid ceiling from EUR 30 000 to EUR 60 000, which is to be used to fund fuel subsidies. However, fuel subsidies are something that many Member States really cannot afford. Therefore, most fishermen would not be helped by this at all. Moreover, the other two problems would still remain: firstly, overfishing would actually increase and, secondly, it would not solve the problem of market prices. Where financial support for fisheries is concerned, I can see a much greater problem. The Member States do not use the resources of the European Fisheries Fund, although the European Union pays 50%. Something urgently needs to change in this regard in the interests of our fishermen. Ladies and gentlemen, let us work together to produce a differentiated text by Thursday and jointly come up with a sensible, sustainable and less showy fisheries policy. Ulrike Rodust,

 Mr President, Commissioner Damanaki, ladies and gentlemen, once again we find a whole package of fisheries policies on the agenda. In my capacity as coordinator, I am pleased to see that we have reached a compromise with the Council and Commission on two regulations. I refer to the Grelier report on technical measures and the Ferreira report on the second financial instrument. We shall also be able to vote in favour of the fisheries agreement with the Union of the Comoros, although I do not wish to hide the fact that I would like to see a fundamental realignment of the partnership agreements within the framework of the reform of the common fisheries policy. However, there are real problems between the institutions in relation to Greenland, where Parliament’s powers are not respected. I am gradually losing patience with the fact that the level of cooperation between the institutions is still so poor. This is something that I have raised time and time again already. I am raising the issue again today. The problem with the management plans must be resolved as a matter of urgency. I would appeal to the Hungarian Presidency of the Council to actively press for a solution. The fact that there is no representative from the Council here today is a clear sign of the Council’s lack of respect for Parliament. I find this incredible. One final remark about the Grelier report. I am aware that some of my fellow Members are frustrated because it was not possible to incorporate the amendments they wanted. However, I find it very regrettable that our fishermen are forced to work with out-of-date technical measures. The fault in this case lies with the Council, which has been unable to agree to a new regulation. As a Parliament we have a great deal of responsibility, which is why we need to act responsibly and extend the existing regulation without amendments. Ulrike Rodust  (S&amp;D

Madam President, food prices have reached new record highs. The volatility of food prices has increased in recent years for various reasons. There is, therefore, great cause for concern. Climate change is causing extreme weather conditions and in some countries whole crops have been destroyed. In addition, there is increasing speculation on food, the danger of which cannot be overestimated – you only have to look at the financial crisis. Moreover, there is increasingly often competition between providing food for the poor and running the cars of the rich. We need to find solutions so that farmers have sufficient incentive to produce food and that only areas that are not used for food production are used for the production of the likes of biofuels. For me as a Social Democrat it is important that everyone has access to wholesome food at reasonable prices and at the same time that farmers are able to receive a reasonable income for their work. Ulrike Rodust,  
on behalf of the S&amp;D Group.

Madam President, Commissioner, I am rather surprised by your remarks. My perception of the press – at least in Germany – is somewhat different. It makes me extremely angry, too, that again and again, we are faced with scandals in the area of food safety. We cannot allow this to happen. I am aware that regulations and laws alone cannot prevent criminal activities in this area. However, we must do everything we can to make it as difficult as possible for those responsible. The Commission must call on the Member States to urgently review the level of their penalties in this area. The wilful and negligent handling of food and feed must not be punished with trivial penalties. Often, the fine is so low compared with the profit that it is paid out of the petty cash. It is also extremely important to increase the number of state inspectors. The current example in Germany demonstrates very well that the principle of self-checking has major shortcomings. I would like to point out that the polluter pays principle needs to be applied consistently throughout the whole chain – from trough to table. After all, the safety of our food begins with what we feed to our animals. Innocent people should not have to suffer the consequences of the criminal behaviour of others. As yet, it is not clear who will pay for the losses suffered by farmers as a result of the dioxin scandal. One thing is certain: it will not be the polluters that have gone bankrupt, as there is absolutely no money left there. This is unacceptable. In this regard, a European fund should be considered that all feedstuff manufacturers would have to pay into. The problems that keep occurring in connection with food safety continue to make one thing clear: for the whole process chain, for both food as well as feed, we need to ensure complete traceability. The EU regulation and national legislation need to be improved in this regard. Ulrike Rodust  (S&amp;D

 Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, as coordinator for the Committee on Fisheries, I find the fisheries aspect of this interim agreement particularly interesting. In this regard, there were a few controversial issues at the start with regard to the relaxation of the rules of origin for Papua New Guinea. I support the Commission’s idea of using this relaxation to stimulate the economy of one of the poorest countries in the world. I am convinced that this is also something that should be of concern to those of us involved in fisheries policy. At the same time, I can understand the concerns of the European industry, but I cannot honestly imagine that the relaxations granted will lead to Papua New Guinea becoming a serious competitor of our canning industry. However, we need to be vigilant, because it will clearly not help anyone if we relocate half our canning industry to the Pacific region. In this regard, I have to say, however, that during the debate on this agreement, we have been presented with very contradictory information regarding the question of the extent to which investments are being made in Papua New Guinea and which states are profiting indirectly from the relaxation of the rules of origin. I would therefore urgently call on the Commission to closely monitor the application of this derogation and to submit a report to Parliament in a timely manner on the impact on Papua New Guinea’s development and on the European canning industry. If this arrangement does not have the desired effect in Papua New Guinea and entails unacceptable losses for European companies, we will have to make a different decision when we come to negotiate the final agreement. Please keep us informed of developments. Ulrike Rodust  (S&amp;D

 Mr President, Commissioner, at this point, I would like once again to point out that a decision has already been made to ban the practice of battery farming in cages. The Member States and the egg producers have had plenty of time to implement the directive for the abandonment of conventional battery practices. The time has not run out quite yet – there are still twelve months to go before the practice is to be completely banned. I believe that we must ensure that battery farming is completely banned by 1 January 2012. It must be possible to threaten the Member States who have not succeeded in implementing the directive by then with legal action, such as financial penalties. We also need to ensure that eggs which originate from farming practices that do not comply with European law are not sold in the internal European market. Ulrike Rodust  (S&amp;D

 I would like to draw the attention of the Council to a problem which is threatening to paralyse the cooperation between the two institutions on the subject of fisheries policy. This is about the regulations for long-term management plans. These regulations lie at the heart of the common fisheries policy. The Council and a majority of the Member States do not accept that the Treaty of Lisbon has given the European Parliament the right of codecision on these regulations. The ministers are acting in opposition to the Council and the Council’s legal service, in opposition to the opinion of the Commission and in opposition, of course, to the will of the European Parliament. The Council currently has two management plans which cannot be adopted. The Commission cannot submit further plans, which are urgently needed in the interests of our fishermen and our seas and which have long since been completed and are lying in a drawer. This situation is unacceptable. I am calling on the Belgian Presidency and the future Hungarian Presidency to start negotiations with Parliament immediately, so that we can find a solution. We are ready to begin discussions. Thank you very much. Ulrike Rodust  (S&amp;D

 Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, I support the compromise reached for the resolution. As coordinator for the Group of the Progressive Alliance of Socialists and Democrats in the European Parliament in the Committee on Fisheries, I am also interested in the fisheries agreement with Morocco. It is good that we are calling for the resolution for international law to be respected in connection with the exploitation of resources in Western Sahara. Unfortunately, most Members of this House are not aware that there is an opinion issued by Parliament’s legal service which states that the current fisheries agreement with Morocco contravenes international law if it is not demonstrated that the people of Western Sahara benefit from the agreement. There is currently no demonstration of this and the European Commission has therefore put negotiations concerning renewal of the agreement on hold. I very much hope that a diplomatic solution can be found here. However, it has to be clear to us that we cannot ignore international law on account of economic interests. Ulrike Rodust  (S&amp;D

 Madam President, Mr Cioloş, ladies and gentlemen, bees play a decisive role in our ecosystem. On the one hand, they are important for the preservation of biodiversity and, on the other, biodiversity is important for the preservation of the bees, not only because this is the International Year of Biodiversity, but also because they contribute to our own survival. As part of the reform of the common agricultural policy, we should focus, among other things, on preventing monocultures and increasing the use of wide crop rotation. I do not want to talk about plant protection products and pesticides today. I think that it is important to promote and develop research in this area and to improve the coordination between different research projects in the individual Member States in order to ensure that we have healthy bees. Whatever happens, we should continue to support the beekeeping sector beyond 2013 and also make sure that in future, we have both enough bees and enough beekeepers to care for them.

 Mr President, Mrs Damanaki, I am very pleased that this week, we are able to adopt four important regulations on fisheries policy, and that we have been able to reach agreement among ourselves as well as with the Council and Commission on the reports concerning aquaculture and technical measures in the Baltic Sea. Unfortunately, the same cannot be said for the two regulations on long-term management plans. The right formula for management of sardine stocks has always been subject to considerable argument among the committee. I believe that the submission to plenary looks very good and I am pleased that it seems that the Group of the European People’s Party (Christian Democrats) has also now realised this, as it has tabled no more amendments. I assume that you will be voting in favour tomorrow. We have a much more serious problem where the Council is concerned, however. Contrary to the advice of their own legal experts, the majority of the Member States are refusing to accept the European Parliament’s right of codecision – a full year after the entry into force of the Treaty of Lisbon! I consider that outrageous. I have therefore suggested to the chair of our committee that a joint letter be written to the European fisheries ministers. I would be pleased if we could reach agreement in the coming days so that together, we can demonstrate how determined Parliament is. We will not allow ourselves to be fobbed off by the Council so easily. Ulrike Rodust,

 Mr President, Commissioner Damanaki, ladies and gentlemen, I am pleased that we are able to adopt a regulation that represents one more small step towards our shared goal of sustainable fisheries. The regional fisheries organisations are extraordinarily important institutions for good management worldwide. Unfortunately, the negotiations are often difficult and progress much too slow for impatient people such as me. We must therefore do all we can to strengthen the regional fisheries organisations. I will now comment on the specific outcome of the NEAFC report. I believe that the new port state control ruling in the NEAFC and the new measures to prevent illegal fisheries are very much to be welcomed. Nonetheless, we had to conduct intensive negotiations with the Council and Commission on matters that seem extremely technical at first glance, but which are important for our future work. I think we have found a compromise that is acceptable to all parties in the matter of delegated acts. We also succeeded in reaching agreement on how future NEAFC decisions are to be transposed into EU law. It is no secret, however, that the Commission is not very happy with the result achieved here. I can understand that. We cannot allow it to take years for the European Union to implement NEAFC decisions. In this respect, Council and Parliament must together prove that we are able to conclude a codecision procedure quickly where necessary. Finally, I would like to say something about a matter that is very current: the dispute with Iceland over mackerel fishing. We already have the NEAFC, which governs the international waters of the North-East Atlantic. In the case of migratory species such as mackerel, however, we also need an agreement that applies in territorial waters. As you know, that is still a sticking point. I feel it is extremely regrettable that, despite the cooperation working in the main, there is so much dispute over this. How about giving the regional fisheries organisations authority for coastal waters – at least for migratory species? It would be a radical step, of course, but undoubtedly one worth considering.

 Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, we should vote in favour of this report on the animal experiments directive. In its negotiations with the Commission and the Council, Parliament has achieved a great deal: namely replacement, reduction and refinement. It is true that from an animal welfare perspective, we are still doing too little. However, the Council was not prepared to do more and has made it clear that there would be no new directive if we did not accept these results. This does not mean that we cannot continue to make progress in this area in future. Animal welfare and research must be given high priority in our policies. I would be very happy if we were able to stop animal experiments completely today. Unfortunately, we are a long way from achieving this goal and, therefore, we must ensure that we provide animals with as much protection as possible. The compromise that has been negotiated offers a far better foundation for doing this. The only important thing is to make sure that all the Member States implement the new directive consistently. I would like to thank the rapporteur and all the shadow rapporteurs warmly for their hard work. Ulrike Rodust  (S&amp;D

I thank the rapporteur. Many ideas from my group have been worked into the report before us, and now we have a very good result. Our primary goal must be to ensure high-quality food production in Europe. In the discussion on the organisation of agrarian reform, there was frequent talk of compensation of public goods. In my opinion, this debate goes in the right direction. Only if the citizens of the EU are convinced that efforts are really being made and money is not simply being paid out across the board will the common agricultural policy get the recognition that it deserves. The development of rural areas plays an ever greater role. In order to prevent the obliteration and desertification of our agriculture, we must develop further instruments that will stop the rural exodus. Active rural areas are an attractive living environment not just for farmers, but also for people who do not want to live in cities. We should approve the report as it stands with a large majority in plenary in order to send a clear outward signal. Ulrike Rodust  (S&amp;D

 Mr President, Mrs Damanaki, European fisheries policy is facing enormous challenges. Our fishermen have to cope with diminishing stocks and at the same time have to deal with competition on the global market that is not always fair. We urgently need to introduce radical reforms in order to put an end to overfishing in European waters and to ensure the survival of European fisheries. I agree with Commissioner Damanaki that we should not ask too much of our fishermen by on the one hand demanding that they make radical reforms while on the other liberalising trade. Doing both of these things at the same time will place too high a burden on our fishermen. The best way to increase competitiveness is to allow fish stocks to recover. Another way to enable European fisheries to survive would be through better marketing. Under certain circumstances, European consumers are prepared to pay more for European fish if they are better informed about its origin. Ulrike Rodust  (S&amp;D

 Mr President, I have not asked for the floor to raise a point of order, but I would like to ask you, Mr President, and my fellow Members to be aware of the following: there is a problem with the translation here. I have tabled an amendment to the Lyon report, recital Ae: ‘whereas the CAP must be geared to the maintenance and development of multifunctional, sustainable agriculture throughout Europe.’ Unfortunately, the word ‘extensive’ has been used in the translations. However, the word ‘flächendeckend’ in the German translation has a completely different meaning. It means ‘in all of the regions of Europe’. There should be agriculture (‘flächendeckend’ agriculture) even throughout mountainous regions. ‘Extensive’ means something entirely different. Ulrike Rodust  (S&amp;D

Madam President, I would like to thank Mrs Damanaki and Mr Oettinger. Their words give us hope. Although the Gulf of Mexico is a long way away, the disaster may affect our animal life too, fish in particular. If the oil from the Gulf is driven into the open Atlantic, it could affect the spawning grounds of the European eel, for example, which was already threatened with extinction prior to the oil catastrophe. This is not a natural event, but rather an unbelievable disaster triggered by human error. For this reason, we must do all we can to ensure something like this never happens again. We are responsible for the safety of European oil platforms. We need to put our laws to the test because European environmental liability provisions are not enforceable in the event of oil catastrophes on the high seas. There are over 400 oil platforms in the North Sea alone. In view of the fact that the European Union has 320 000 km of maritime coast, it is essential that we should move away from oil and towards a future based on renewable energies. I call on the Commission to propose concrete solutions and to act quickly. Ulrike Rodust  (S&amp;D

 Madam President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, the so-called compromise proposal that will be tabled next week in Agadir is, in my view, completely unacceptable. A resumption of commercial whaling is something that the majority of the European public will not understand. I call on the Commission and the Member States to speak out at the meeting in Morocco against the reintroduction of commercial whaling. Of course, on paper the compromise does not, at first sight, look so bad. Its supporters say that it will permit even fewer whales to be hunted than is currently the case. The compromise proposal provides for the introduction of quotas. Let me tell you something from my own experience of quotas in fisheries policy. Quotas, particularly when they apply worldwide, are systematically circumvented. Just look at bluefin tuna. Here quotas are laid down year after year that are systematically exceeded many times over. There is another reason why the European Union should oppose this compromise. It provides for quotas only for those countries that currently – and I would say ‘semi-legally’ – carry out whaling. That would reward the systematic violation of the rules. We should not accept this under any circumstances. Supporters of whaling are hard-nosed in their methods. Japan has allegedly even collected votes from poorer Member States. That is yet another reason why the European Union needs to be united in its rejection of the reintroduction of commercial whaling.

 Madam President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, firstly, I would like to offer my sincere thanks to my fellow Member Mr Milana, who has managed to produce a first-class report. In view of the dramatic overfishing of our seas and the continually growing demand for fish products, alternatives to wild catches are needed now more than ever. However, aquaculture is only an alternative if ecological interests do not get ignored. For me, ecologically-sound aquaculture means, for example, that efforts need to be made to reduce the proportion of fish meal in the feed. Ultimately, we will help our seas very little if we catch 4 kilograms of wild fish in order to produce 1 kilogram of farmed fish. It is also important to avoid a negative impact on surrounding waters. In this regard, much needs to be done in the area of research. At the same time, we must ensure that fish farming does not degenerate into a form of animal cruelty as a result of high stocking densities. In this regard, I would particularly like to stress the fact that we urgently need to establish a maritime development plan. The coexistence of different interests such as aquaculture, fisheries, tourism and, not least, nature conservation must be organised well. All of this has been admirably expressed in our report. Incidentally, a stronger European aquaculture is also valuable from the point of view of employment policy, as it can create jobs in our often disadvantaged coastal regions. Ulrike Rodust  (S&amp;D

 Mr President, the catch documentation programme adopted by the International Commission for the Conservation of Atlantic Tunas (ICCAT) and confirmed by us today is a step in the right direction, but it comes too late. It must not be the case that we only take drastic measures once stocks of a threatened species are decimated to 6%. Illegal fishing is a particular problem here. I still very much regret the fact that the European Union did not succeed in obtaining a better outcome in the CITES negotiation. The ICCAT and other regional fisheries organisations must act with more foresight in future. It is therefore important that we as the European Parliament get more involved in these bodies to counterbalance the short-sighted national interests. The public interest in the sustainable management of fish stocks is becoming ever greater. It is important to convert this into a responsible policy. Mrs Damanaki, I can assure you that the Group of the Progressive Alliance of Socialists and Democrats in the European Parliament will support you in any activity that helps to maintain bluefin tuna stocks and to safeguard the livelihoods of the fishermen.

 Mr President, Mr Cioloş, I have in front of me an analysis of the economic situation in the German agricultural sector. The analysis involved the evaluation of 19 100 sets of accounts from full-time and part-time farms. The results have been projected on the basis of the distribution of farms from the Farm Structure Survey of 2007. In the financial year 2008-2009, the overall situation deteriorated significantly. The figures for the 18 200 full-time dairy and arable farms fell from EUR 45 400 to EUR 34 400. That represents a reduction of 24%. Particularly large losses occurred in 2008-2009. Operating results fell to EUR 29 300 (minus 45%) and to EUR 43 000 (minus 18%). In contrast, mixed livestock farms … (The President cut off the speaker) Ulrike Rodust  (S&amp;D

 Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, a warm welcome to all the fishermen and -women in the Chamber! Today’s vote represents a milestone for the European Parliament. For the first time since the ratification of the Treaty of Lisbon, we have the opportunity to express our opinions on the reform of the common fisheries policy (CFP). In the next few years, our power and our responsibilities will increase significantly. This report is acceptable and I would like to thank Mrs Patrão Neves and Mrs Andrés Barea for their hard work. We have succeeded in incorporating important social democratic concerns into the report. These include specific support for small-scale fisheries. Those affected will now be included in the decision-making process. Support must be given in particular to small family businesses. Their presence in the coastal regions not only provides jobs, but also increases the attractiveness of many of these regions for tourists. Some parts of this report still need improvement and we have tabled amendments for that purpose. We social democrats want to make it clear that one of the central problems is the outstanding overcapacity. It is a fact that environmental sustainability is a fundamental prerequisite for the economic survival of fishermen. Therefore, the environment must take priority. A third important point concerns the external aspects of the CFP and the partnership agreements with third countries. We move that paragraph 121, which puts undue emphasis on the interests of European fisheries, should be deleted. We should behave outside European waters in just the same way as we do at home. This means promoting sustainability, human rights and democracy throughout the world and ensuring that the income from partnership agreements does not disappear into the coffers of corrupt dictatorships. Finally, I would like to make one more fundamental point. European fisheries policy is a hot potato, because it involves so many powerful national interests. It will come as no surprise that these have led to heated debates within the groups in recent weeks. Fortunately, we have all succeeded in finding effective compromises. However, when it comes to the legislative process, we must focus more closely on this issue than we have today and come up with some common European solutions. We must leave the trivial problems of national greed to the Council. Ulrike Rodust  (S&amp;D

 Madam President, Commissioner, Council, I would like to begin by thanking my fellow Member Mr Capoulas Santos, who has made this resolution possible. Today we are talking about our dairy farmers and whether we are going to leave them in the lurch or deal with them in an honest manner. I do not believe that we should leave them in the lurch, but should be honest in our dealings with them. Yes, short-term measures to overcome the crisis are urgently needed. Yes, intervention is perfectly acceptable for a short period if the price of milk has reached rock bottom, and additional subsidies, loans and funds to combat the crisis are justified. However, what is totally unacceptable is, firstly, to start up discussions about milk quotas again and, secondly, to reintroduce tax-funded export refunds for products supplied to developing countries. We abandoned this one way street in 2003 and I appeal to you to keep it that way for the sake of our dairy farmers.Barbara Weiler  (S&amp;D

Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, the single market has become a matter of course for our citizens. Who can fail to remember with amusement the judgment of 1979 on Cassis de Dijon or the banana war with the United States? As we look at global trade wars or disputes, the European single market appears as a mainstay of the European philosophy: no barriers, no discrimination, legal certainty and fair competition.  Nevertheless, in the interplay between the global economic powers we, the European Union, must continue to safeguard the rights of consumers and SMEs and protect consumers against new dangers, for example, chemical substances or new, creative tricks by vendors, such as exist in the financial market. We social democrats support the Commission in its measures against dominant practices and unfair competition, regardless of who is involved, even when this applies to Microsoft or Google, to German energy companies or Gazprom. We must also observe Jacques Delors’s third point more closely: the single market also means solidarity, which unites. Barbara Weiler  (S&amp;D

 Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, I would like to thank the rapporteur and, above all, the whole team of shadow rapporteurs, for producing these proposals, which we will adopt tomorrow. Much has already been said about the benefits of standards. I would like to mention two further examples that we think are self-evident: the universal charger for mobile phones and, in future, the realisation of electromobility. Without standards, these things would absolutely not be possible. Unfortunately, not all of society knows how standards are produced. It is not this House – and nor will it be in future – it is national, European and international institutes like CEN and CENELEC that produce standards. The last 25 years has been a good period, but there were also a number of shortcomings, which we have now tidied up. The creation of standards was far too slow, far too expensive, too opaque and too unilateral in terms of participation. We have now rectified that with this proposal, and we will make access cheaper for small and medium-sized enterprises, too, we will involve the trade unions and the social partners, the consumer organisations, and we will link up with national, international and European bodies. I am also pleased about the sensible involvement in procurement. As a final point, I will deal with acceptance. This is something that we will still have to test out and check the state thereof. Germany’s DIN institute had serious concerns at the start of the debate about the direction that acceptance was moving in. I believe those concerns have since been resolved. The SME sector in Hesse, for example, has already provided me with feedback. I found out that it is pleased with this compromise, with this proposal from the rapporteur and the Committee on the Internal Market and Consumer Protection, and that it sees a series of improvements for the future.

 Madam President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, in the past week, I had the honour of speaking about the 20th anniversary of the completion of the internal market at a Franco-German partnership celebration. It was interesting to see how the guests reacted to this. They took it all for granted, and indeed it is good that citizens consider this something that goes without saying. The four fundamental freedoms are the core of the European Union, and I hope that we, as Parliament, will fight all joint attempts to erect new barriers and new borders, such as when the German Government and the former French Government attempted to erect new barriers, because the freedom of movement of our citizens is at least as important to us as the freedom of movement of capital or goods. In my view, Mr Busuttil has presented a good and helpful report. The internal market scoreboard, SOLVIT and other instruments are useful for establishing whether the governments really want European laws and whether the deficits are actually being reduced, as the Council has in fact agreed. We want the internal market to be simplified for consumers. We want SMEs to have easier access and we want all our citizens to profit from it. Interestingly, transposition is not always related to the size of the country. As has already been mentioned, Malta comes out best; Belgium, unfortunately, has not done so well. Mr Busuttil, your motion is also interesting and I have great sympathy for you, but I must point out that there are a few other demands in your report that already incorporate this, such as Article 18 on transparency, or Article 24, in which we call for correlation tables, or even Article 21, which suggests that the European Court of Justice could work more quickly. So perhaps we should work on this first. On behalf of the Group of the Progressive Alliance of Socialists and Democrats in the European Parliament, I should like to highlight four further aspects. Firstly, the transposition must be correct; that is, it does not have to be gold-plated, but it must not be lax and inadequate. Mr Chatzimarkakis, if I may have your ear for a moment: the two liberal camps in the national German Government are currently dabbling with the Payment Services Directive, and from what I have heard, initial reports are not encouraging. Now for my second point, which is that the internal market is also a way of overcoming the crisis, creates jobs and contributes to growth. Thirdly, we consider the procedures for the social protection of workers to be too cumbersome, because as far as we are concerned – and this is my only criticism, Commissioner Barnier – social cohesion is dealt with too briefly in this report. We will insist on this, because we have a long tradition of social cohesion. Finally, I would like to quote your former colleague, Jacques Delors, who said that the internal market works according to three principles: competition which stimulates, cooperation which strengthens and solidarity which unites.

 Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I would like to talk about the European Development Fund (EDF), and I am confident that we will be able to reach agreement in this area, not only in committee, but also in plenary. This debate – and this is surely also important to mention – is taking place under the very particular circumstances of the hard times of economic and financial crisis within the European Union and, essentially, also worldwide. That is precisely why the attention of the general public is also on our debate here concerning discharge and the review of the budget. After all, we all actually want the budget to be correctly implemented and for it to be meaningful and, above all – I mention this with regard to the EDF in particular – sustainable, too. The EDF is our most important instrument for reducing poverty, that is to say, in the best interests of the European Union, for preventing wars and also for giving people prospects for the future. I am absolutely convinced that that is also the way the citizens and taxpayers see it. The Social Democrats support the report that we voted on in committee, although this was only after our amendments had been adopted and the report took a slightly different direction, as meaningful and necessary criticism is only right and proper. However, as Ms Herczog already mentioned, an attempt at politicisation is being made here, for example, with regard to the criticism of the United Nations. It goes without saying that the UN must improve its efficiency and, in particular, become more transparent. However, it is also an important partner for our work and it has useful infrastructure. We must, in any case, provide training in our offices and increase capacity, as that is the only way to work efficiently. That is something I would like to emphasise and, to conclude, I would like to state that we need a common assessment of the error rate and, of course, also a different agricultural policy.

 Mr President, Baroness Ashton, ladies and gentlemen, Ms Oomen-Ruijten, your speech has made it clear to me that the Members who recently visited Myanmar together with me and Mr Langen as part of a delegation from the Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN) have a rather different view. It is no longer possible to say that the regime is still a junta. There are moves under way towards democracy that we have experienced at first hand and seen the effects of. I believe that everyone who has been involved in the introduction of democracy on the ground in Myanmar has been impressed, relieved and filled with enthusiasm. In my opinion, this is particularly true in the light of the debate that we have just held and the developments in Syria, Mali and Egypt. What can the EU do to ensure that this process continues in Myanmar? Sympathy alone is not enough. We need to share responsibility for further development aid projects and give them our support. We should encourage the ASEAN countries and, in particular, Myanmar’s neighbour, Thailand, to continue helping, as they have already done for a long period. However, we also need to lift the sanctions. The following comment recently appeared in a newspaper: Myanmar is a gold mine with huge quantities of raw materials, gas and oil, and all of this is now available. The estimate is that growth will reach a level of 6%. We must also help to ensure – not alone, but the EU is partly responsible for this – that the growth and the wealth in what is still, in part, a very poor country does not end up in the capitals of America, Europe and China, but reaches the population. Only then will there be stable, peaceful and democratic long-term development in the country. Barbara Weiler,

 Mr President, Commissioners, ladies and gentlemen, Malaysia is a wonderful country with age-old traditions and cultural riches. As members of the ASEAN delegation, we have frequently seen for ourselves how quickly and remarkably this country has grown. The resulting increase in economic power has led to Malaysia achieving top ten ranking when it comes to world growth rates, a fact that has greatly impressed us. It is for this reason that I would like to state on behalf of my own group, the Group of the Progressive Alliance of Socialists and Democrats in the European Parliament, as well as all those here who signed the resolution, that we find it impossible to understand why Malaysia still practises this outmoded method of chastisement, which harkens back to the country’s colonial past and which seems almost mediaeval to us in Europe. We are not alone in voicing this criticism: lawyers in Malaysia itself are equally opposed to the practice. Caning violates all United Nations human rights agreements and we believe that things need to change quickly. We welcomed the charter of the ASEAN states, which emphasises in several articles and the preamble that – and I quote – ‘the promotion and protection of human rights’ is among the essential requirements of the ASEAN Charter, which has also been ratified by Malaysia. Malaysia has long espoused democratic principles. However, this also involves the rule of law with universal standards. This is something we shall repeat again and again when we are in Malaysia and the ASEAN states, and the European Parliament will underline this with this resolution. Barbara Weiler,

 Madam President, President-in-Office of the Council, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, first of all, I would like to thank the team of shadow rapporteurs from the Committee on Legal Affairs and the Committee on Industry, Research and Energy, my colleagues and everyone who contributed to this splendid result. Without constructive and fair cooperation with the Commission and with the Belgian Presidency, we would certainly not have achieved this result. As rapporteur, I am – as you can imagine – very pleased with the result, firstly because we have made significant improvements in relation to the old directive, and secondly because we have introduced new ways to encourage better payment practices. We have achieved the goal. Well, I would prefer to say that the course has been set for improving the liquidity of SMEs, the small and medium-sized enterprises, and for securing investments in new products, new jobs and new processes. Why was it necessary to improve this directive? The legislation from 2000 was non-binding and not very efficient. In recent years, payment practices in almost all Member States have deteriorated, and this happened even before the financial and economic crisis. The reform was also requested by the small businesses that expressed their wishes within the framework of the Small Business Act. They wanted payment practices in Europe to be organised in a considerably more efficient manner. With regard to the results, I can say, firstly, that we have trodden a new path. We have strict rules. As a matter of principle, invoices must be paid within 30 days with few exceptions, and these must be justified. We have introduced a higher late payment interest rate of 8%. We have set the recovery costs at a completely non-bureaucratic fixed amount of EUR 40, and we have made it easier than it was previously for small businesses to assert their rights. The second aspect to the new path, however, is the positive incentives and the new instruments, for example, the naming of customers with good payment practices, more information provided to small businesses concerning their rights, payment in instalments and the promotion of alternative dispute resolution mechanisms. This legislation is also part of the ‘better regulation’ approach and it will also apply to the EU institutions. We are particularly proud of this, because – as I am sure you can imagine – not everyone was enthusiastic about it. Of course, there were a few conflicts and I would like to mention some of these. Firstly, to start with, there were certainly major differences and a diversity of opinions in Parliament. The 100 amendments alone demonstrate that we first had to tussle together over this in Parliament, too. The Commission was certainly not always happy with our endeavours, including the extension of this to the business to business level, but I think that, overall, we have achieved a good result. It was the Council that posed the problems. It is regrettable that the Council has not always fulfilled its objective of helping small businesses. I find that particularly regrettable for the relatively rich and well-structured countries like Germany and Austria. With regard to the professional organisations, I can only say that they were constructive, even though we, naturally, did not always accept or were not always able to go with their opinions. In summary, the next steps are that, after tomorrow’s vote, we expect the Council to conduct a final positive vote and then the Member States will be able to implement this legislation. We do not expect it to take two years for this to be implemented. Instead, we expect the Member States to begin to transpose it into national law as early as January of next year. Barbara Weiler,  
rapporteur.

Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, when we discuss this matter back home in our electoral districts, I believe we will all find that we receive a great deal of support – something that is not a foregone conclusion where European dossiers are concerned – because this issue of late payment as a whole is not merely criticised back home; it is considered by everyone to be a given that payments should be made on time. That is the case irrespective of which party someone belongs to, and it is not dependent on what branch of industry you talk to, either. So we have broad agreement. I would also like to thank my fellow Members who have indicated their agreement with this result this evening. I would like to mention three more aspects. As I said at the beginning of the debate, we will set the wheels in motion tomorrow. However, we will have to look very closely at whether the relaxations that we have introduced for micro-businesses, for agricultural undertakings, for example, and for artisan companies, are actually sufficient to enable these enterprises to obtain the money they are owed. We will have to examine very carefully how the limited freedom of contract will work. That is something new in the European internal market that we are now going to try out and that all of us also more or less support. We will need to examine whether the 8% late payment interest rate is adequate; Parliament would have liked it to be 9%. We will see how it works, and I would like to ask the Commission to pay close attention in order to ensure that, during the process of implementation, the Member States do not water down the directive. I also see definite success on the horizon. I have heard that Spain has already produced new national legislation following our methods, and I know that the same is true of other Member States. In any case, our Committee will monitor the situation or carry out an impact assessment according to a directive, so that the Member States also know that, when the parliamentary term comes to an end, we will know who has implemented the improved payment practices as we intended and who has not. I would like to thank everyone who has contributed to this result, including the Belgian Presidency, which has perhaps not received enough recognition for its contribution. We know how efficiently and constructively you conducted the negotiations – a small country, but I would say a country with very intelligent and efficient methods for achieving results in Europe.

 Mr President, representatives of the Commission and, above all, the Council, ladies and gentlemen, we hear this every year in the debate on improvements in the implementation of the distribution of European funds: more accurate and more efficient control of expenditure in all bodies and institutions, more transparency for Parliament and also for citizens. The presence today of the Council is the first indication that something is changing in the Council as well. Marvellous, we are pleased – as you have heard – but that is certainly not enough for us. It is precisely the difference that you mentioned – you believe you have created complete transparency, while we believe you have not yet answered our questions from the debate at the end of November – that shows that we are not yet cooperating with each other as well as we should be. You spoke of the 1970 agreement that you want to amend and develop. That is all well and good, but this expectation of ours is hardly new. We have mentioned it a few times and now you have acted as if it were a new thing entirely. The Group of the Progressive Alliance of Socialists and Democrats will support Mr Czarnecki’s report. We share his criticism and that of the other groups. We will not grant discharge to the Council, either today or next month. I am therefore surprised by the request by Mrs Andreasen, since I obviously believe that the Member States are responsible for 80% of the funds. That does not exempt the Council from its responsibilities, since the Council is not a fourth or fifth institution in the EU, but works together with the Member States. However, our criticism, I agree, has no real consequences. As Mr Audy has pointed out, we must develop our tools. Every year, we show the Council the yellow card of discharge refusal and nothing happens. We must therefore develop our tools: not only tangible criticism, but also consequences – what happens if the Council does not work with us. That will possibly also mean constitutional change.

 Mr President, Commissioners, ladies and gentlemen, this joint debate this morning and the high quality of all three reports indicates the high priority given to internal market and consumer policy in Europe. I would like to thank all three rapporteurs and the many shadow rapporteurs and fellow Members who have produced this joint work. I would like to focus on two crucial points. The first is that we, that is, the Commission and those of us in this House, are assuming that everything runs relatively harmoniously in the internal market and that we have enlightened consumers and fair suppliers. That is often the case, but not always. There are irresponsible suppliers who only see their short-term profits and therefore, we need stronger market surveillance and supervision. However, there are also uninformed consumers. We need better information. It is not enough for the package leaflet to be readable. We need continuous information. Someone has just said that we need confidence. However, confidence comes from knowledge. I have heard that in Germany, only one in two 14 to 15 year olds understands the meaning of inflation. I do not even want to ask what the results of the questionnaire were when it came to the word ‘deflation’. We need schools to be better networked along with information on the conflict between the interests of suppliers and consumers. That is mentioned in the reports by my fellow Members ...

 Mr President, Commissioner, Mr Caldeira, ladies and gentlemen, I would like to start by thanking Mr Caldeira and his team. His report will be very useful to us in our deliberations which lead up to the granting of a discharge. I have a sense of déjà vu, because as far as I can tell, the Council is once again conspicuous by its absence, just as it was last year. I am being so critical because the Council, as one of our major community institutions, cannot and should not stand outside this debate. We rightly expect all the Member States to provide control and transparency, but we also expect this from our own institutions and the Council is jointly responsible for what happens or does not happen in the Member States. Of course, the irregularities in the budgets do not affect the Council’s budget as severely as they do the agricultural sector, but nevertheless, we will also have questions about public procurement, late payments or overdue payments and repeated overestimating. We will be discussing this with the Council in the next few weeks. It is true that errors are not the same as fraud and that the recovery of payments is a useful tool. Another good tool is the process of naming and shaming in the area of agricultural policy which has proved its worth in Bavaria and in the rest of Germany. I believe that we should continue to use this method because it has become clear that the Member States and the companies involved react to it. We expect the Swedish Presidency to be ready to discuss this over the next few days and also… (The President cut off the speaker) Bernd Lange,

Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, what are we dealing with here? We are dealing with an issue which concerns fair trade. This is not about protectionism for European products. There is one issue, and one issue alone, at stake, namely ensuring that our trade relations are based on fairness. I therefore believe that the threat scenario that China is now creating is completely inappropriate. Let me make it very clear: we want transparency in the investigations, and we do not welcome attempts by China to obstruct these investigations by creating threat scenarios, in which European companies are put under pressure with the threat of countermeasures that are supposedly in the pipeline. No, that is not part of the discussion! We intend to investigate the matter. In reality, however, it is about the following issue. Under what kind of working conditions are the solar panels produced in China? Which direct and indirect subsidies go towards supporting their production? What about the value chain as a whole? There are many different aspects which need to be investigated very carefully.  There is undoubtedly overcapacity. We cannot have a situation in which dumping is used to reduce overcapacity, at the expense of European jobs and industry. That is why we need to achieve transparency here. Hence my question, and this is also addressed to the Commission: does this transparency exist on the Chinese side as well? Does the Commission have the opportunity to look at all of the relevant facts? That should have been China’s immediate reaction: instead of making threatening gestures, it should have created transparency. Secondly, are you willing to pursue this process to the end, even if China were to yield at the last moment? We do not want a situation like the ethanol case with the United States, when the procedure was shelved at the last minute! I urge you to pursue it right to the end. Bernd Lange,

Mr President, Madam President-in-Office of the Council, I would like to begin by sincerely thanking the rapporteur for what is, in my view, an excellent report which covers the many different facets of our relations with Kazakhstan in a truly outstanding manner. Thank you very much indeed.  Speaking on behalf of the Committee on International Trade, I would like to talk about four aspects which are particularly important to us. First of all, as the President-in-Office of the Council has already mentioned, Kazakhstan is seeking accession to the WTO, and that means, of course, that it must comply with and implement WTO rules. It will also be subject to the WTO’s dispute settlement regime. This is an important step towards transparency and fairness.  Secondly, when we talk about transparency and fairness, raw materials are, of course, an issue of great relevance in this context. Kazakhstan’s economy is geared mainly towards the raw materials sector, so the main priority here is to create workable tax and financial frameworks, but without losing sight of the environmental dimension. The aim must be to ensure that raw materials extraction serves the interests of the people of Kazakhstan but also safeguards the interests of the environment. Thirdly, this includes the issue of phosphorus, for example. We cannot have a situation in which the export of phosphorus involves the use of dumping practices, ultimately putting a question mark over well-established structures in the European Union. We support trade, but it must take place under conditions which are fair and reasonable. Fourthly, as in all the trade agreements concluded by the EU, trade also means fair conditions of competition in the fields of workers’ rights and environmental standards. For that reason, we also need to include a sound and viable chapter on sustainable development in the agreement. We want this demand to be reflected in the resolution; that is our firm position. Bernd Lange  (S&amp;D
). 
 – (DE) 
Mr President, Commissioner, I think you are being too defensive if you only examine how the consequences of plant closures and overcapacity can be remedied. No, I believe we need to examine how corporate policy can be shaped in a sensible way. The lesson is firstly that we need different forms of corporate governance. We need employees to be more involved in their companies so that sensible solutions can be found for the future of firms. This is one of the central lessons learned from the crisis: greater worker participation in companies to enable sensible solutions to be found. Secondly, Commissioner, we in fact have 15 factories in the European Union that are running at around 50 % capacity. When I look at the global market, however, Commissioner, car production is growing from roughly 79 million to 84 million. Something is wrong here! It is unacceptable that we are de-industrialising here, while, on the other hand, the global automotive market is growing by 3 % a year. No, we do not need to just close down car factories, we need investments in future technologies to ensure that the automotive industry remains in Europe and is competitive on the global market. This also means that global corporations must be urged to exercise restraint, as they also make global investment decisions and do not necessarily place a particular emphasis on European interests. A more active role is therefore required from the European Commission! Bernd Lange,

Mr President, Commissioner, yes, we support you in your efforts to bolster the European steel industry. I also think it is right that trends that are also in evidence in the steel industry, namely simply reducing capacities, are not followed. Just recently I read an article in the press by the President of the European steel industry body that said that 100 000 of the close to 400 000 jobs in the industry would have to be cut, that we had to shed 25 % of capacity – a hard, deep cut. No, we cannot deal with the problem like this. We must make sure that we stabilise this core industry in the European Union and create prospects for development. This of course was a foundation stone on which the European Union was built. I would like to bring to mind the European Coal and Steel Community, which very successfully developed a research and structural policy for the steel sector. I believe that there should continue to be such a model; work on the further development of the European steel industry should involve three equally represented groups – the Commission, employers and employees.  What we really need are innovations to ensure we have highly flexible steel at our disposal, particularly for the energy transition, an area in which there is undoubtedly demand. We must also ensure that the steel industry can exist in a competitive environment and is not unduly burdened with costs. You therefore have our support to stabilise the European steel industry.

Madam President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, this agreement must indeed be scrutinised very carefully for it has major political implications. In Israel, there is a debate under way as to whether, with this agreement, we mean to support Israel or show it the red card. In my view, this is an unproductive debate. It is not for us to adopt a position on the State of Israel and its people. Our task is simply to adopt a position towards the present Israeli Government.  When we conclude agreements with other countries, it is only right and proper that we apply the standards and values that we uphold in the European Union to our partner countries as well. With that in mind, it must be said that the present Israeli Government, in its conduct towards the Occupied Territories and the people who live there, is not acting in accordance with the values to which the European Union is committed. That is why we cannot enter into an agreement with that government without giving the matter careful thought. Secondly, there is still a lack of clarity on a number of points. The previous speaker said that there was a consensus here. No, there is no consensus. The vote in committee was 13 to 15. In my view, the origin of generic drugs is an issue that must be clarified in future in order to ensure that they do not come from the Occupied Territories or from illegal settlements. We must also clarify how the Commission will in future exercise the right to extend this agreement to other products as well. That is why we need more time for a thorough-going discussion and why I fully support Véronique De Keyser’s demand for this matter to referred back to committee for intensive deliberation.

 Our values apply on an universal basis, of course. We make no distinction at all. Why you adopted the position you did two years ago is not something that I can explain.

Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, when negotiating the Economic Partnership Agreements (EPAs), we must always remember that we are entering the negotiations with different requirements. We have the European Union on one side with a strong Commissioner and a large team of officials, sitting across the negotiating table from young countries with little capacity. To this extent it is more than right and proper to allow these countries more time and opportunity for negotiations. We should not give the impression that we are putting pressure on these countries by abruptly ending market access opportunities. I also believe that we should not force anyone to sign something but rather that, in a spirit of partnership, we should negotiate solutions with these countries that are acceptable to both sides. Sometimes this requires a bit more time. That is why the Group of the Progressive Alliance of Socialists and Democrats in the European Parliament clearly supports the proposal from Mr Martin to give this two years, but no more than two years, in order to identify ways in which we can reach agreement. Mr Fjellner, I would ask you to support this compromise, because we have succeeded in obtaining a sizeable majority in committee in favour of sending clear signals that this should be brought to a close, while at the same time offering opportunities for negotiations.

Mr President, Commissioner, Mr Kariņš, I should like to start by extending the warmest of thanks to the rapporteur, Mr Kariņš, for his hard work and, above all, for his patience during negotiations. I would also like to thank you, Mr Oettinger, for your proposal. In general, you are doing your work really well in the area of energy policy. The object of my criticism, in other words the Council, is not here at present. Ladies and gentlemen, I have participated in around 50 conciliation procedures and trialogues, involving negotiations with the Council. However, in all this time, I have never witnessed anything like this before, namely that the Council has taken a heavy-handed position, seeking to blackmail Parliament by saying: take it or leave it. I have never known the Council’s chief negotiator to get up and leave a trialogue before. So, we have a contradiction to what we are constantly being told in the sermons from on high: we need more involvement from Europe. This morning we have once again discussed the fact that what we need in this crisis situation is more involvement from Europe and an agreement in relation to our core policies. Mr Oettinger, you have hit the nail on the head. Energy policy is central to the European Union, to economic growth and to a forward-looking energy policy. It is only logical, ladies and gentlemen, that we can only have a sound energy policy if we can also agree on a common external energy policy, in other words agreements with third countries. Accordingly, while I understand and sympathise with the idea that achieving the lowest standard is better than nothing, we must press for greater commitment in this legislative proposal. We want to make it mandatory for the Commission to be informed and we want the Commission to participate in negotiations. That is the least we need in order to ensure that a European external energy policy really is put into practice and that the Member States do not drag their feet as usual. We shall table these amendments tomorrow and hope that you will support them so that we can give the Council something more to work with. Commissioner, I am naturally hopeful that you are really serious about your last point, namely that there should be an examination of the Council’s behaviour in future, so that we can get a reasonable revision on track.

Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, thank you for attending this evening’s sitting, so that we can discuss this matter. This issue is clearly not of interest to everyone in plenary this evening. With these safeguard regulations we are still feeling our way somewhat in relation to the Treaty of Lisbon, because the roles of the various institutions and where certain things are regulated are still unclear. Thus we now have to incorporate a number of items in the legislation, by which I mean the ordinary legislation, that have already been included in the wording of the Treaty and in the Council’s decision, but which were in the wrong place. That is why it is good practice to take a closer look at the overall process of establishing this safety net for the agreement with Colombia and Peru. On the one hand, we are placing demands on Colombia and Peru in the agreement and now we must also see how we can define the requirements that we place on ourselves. It is also important that the safety net should remain practicable. It makes little sense to set down regulations that are never applied. This is how things were done in the past. For this reason, we should exercise the powers we have to dust down the safety net legislation so that we can apply it in a positive way. Commissioner, we are concerned about five points. The first is to see what the actual criteria are for casting a safety net. I am quite convinced that, in order to determine when something is having a detrimental effect on the market, we must also address the issue of social standards because, of course, the violation of social standards leads to dumping and can give rise to competitive advantages. Accordingly, this is one of the criteria for applying safety nets, particularly in the area of bananas. Now for my second point. If we are cautious in our approach to the Treaty of Lisbon, then we will naturally find ourselves being more and more cautious about the role of the European Parliament. It is fundamental for us that we, like all the other European institutions, should have the power to launch an investigation. My third point is that if we are serious about more transparency, then this also means that we must include civil society in our dialogue to a greater extent and that this should be institutionalised when we come to examine this agreement with Colombia and Peru. That is why I want to strengthen dialogue with civil society. We need more transparency. Commissioner, you always refer to the safeguard regulations with Korea as a template. The problem is that you have forgotten Article 11 of the agreement with Korea when it comes to the issue of the transparency of monitoring and reporting. I am referring to the requirement that a report must be presented that covers all the different angles, which is something we want to see guaranteed. The fifth issue relates to providing security for the banana producers in Europe’s regions. Bernd Lange,  
rapporteur

Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, we have a huge amount of work ahead of us in the coming three to four months. In accordance with Parliament’s decision, we are going to launch a road map for strengthening workers’ rights, human rights and environmental conditions in Colombia and Peru, while also establishing a safety net for conditions here in the European Union. Neither of these is an easy task. Hence my urgent call on you, Commissioner, to support this work in whatever way you can, particularly with regard to the road map and the involvement of the government in Peru, in order to ensure that we establish a road map for Colombia and Peru within a reasonable timeframe. I get the feeling that the message has not been fully understood there and that people are unaware of just how serious Parliament is about its conditions. Secondly, Commissioner, I would ask you to please take an active mediator role in relation to the Council in the trialogue on the safeguards, so that we can also implement the safeguard regulations in a reasonable timeframe to ensure that we have both the road map and safeguard regulation in place in good time to enable us to vote on this in November and finally put this matter to bed, in the interests of the people of Europe and the people of Colombia and Peru.

 Madam President, Mr De Gucht, ladies and gentlemen, this is a political issue on which we have to decide. We in the Group of the Progressive Alliance of Socialists and Democrats in the European Parliament have analysed the Anti-Counterfeiting Trade Agreement (ACTA) very closely and carefully, and we would like to make it clear that ACTA is not a suitable instrument for guaranteeing copyright protection and preventing counterfeiting. ACTA is the wrong instrument for this and, therefore, we in the S&amp;D Group will be voting against it. Why is that? For three reasons. Firstly, the countries which are mainly responsible for counterfeiting and disregarding copyright are not the subject of the agreement. The good have been sorted out from the bad and, in international terms, it makes absolutely no sense. Secondly, ladies and gentlemen, rules from the analogue area of counterfeiting have been transferred into the digital world and, as a result, the wrong rules are being imposed on consumers who behave differently in a digital environment. This is why we are saying that we cannot put apples and pears into a saucepan and finish up with apple sauce. The wrong things are being combined here and that is the second reason why we are opposed to ACTA. However, ladies and gentlemen, the most important reason is the third one. ACTA is putting the digital world into a straitjacket and we do not even know whether we want it, because the question of enforcing intellectual property rights on the Internet, in the digital environment, has not even been resolved within the European Union. The Commission’s presentation of its legislative proposal is overdue. How can we conclude an international agreement in this area if we have not even discussed the legislative proposal within the European Union and drafted some sensible legislation? Therefore, let us put ACTA to one side and, first of all, draw up a sensible European law. I call on the Commission to submit a legislative proposal for the European Union. (The speaker agreed to take a blue-card question under Rule 149(8)) Bernd Lange  (S&amp;D

Blue-card answer. 
– (DE) 
You are mixing up apples and pears again. Climate policy is obviously something quite different from the question of copyright protection. You know very well that 60% of all counterfeit products come from China and this is why it is genuinely necessary for the international community to enter into a dialogue with China in order to find a solution and not simply to sort out the good countries from the bad ones, Mr Fjellner. Bernd Lange,  
on behalf of the S&amp;D Group.

 Mr President, Commissioner, and of course – at least virtually – President-in-Office of the Council, our resolution is essentially directed towards the Council, as the reality is that we believe – and this touches on Mr Leichtfried’s question – that we, as Parliament, should proffer our position on the issuing of a mandate before one is issued. There is a good reason for this. You have already addressed the resolutions that we have adopted with numerous questions. These resolutions did show quite clearly the two sides of the coin when it comes to trade relations with Japan. We support increased trade relations with Japan – that much is clear – as the negotiations at WTO level have ground to a halt and Japan is one of our most important trading partners in the world. Over the last year, EU exports to Japan had a total value of around EUR 49 billion, while exports from Japan to the EU came in at around EUR 69 billion – in other words, we are talking about a very important part of our economic dynamics. That being the case, we need to also strengthen this so that the inter-exchange and the growth dynamic develop further. That is right and proper. On the other side of the coin, however, when it comes to market access on the Japanese side, we actually have non-tariff barriers to trade. That, after all, is why the Commission carried out this scoping exercise, and it was only recently that we obtained the results. Once again, analysing this situation precisely is the right thing to do. No sooner do we look, for example, at the key sector that is the motor industry, than three non-tariff barriers to trade hit us right in the face. Of course there is, for one thing, an agreement at UN level about technical standards for cars, as well as for vehicle parts. Clearly, recognition of this is crucial to market access. The European Union has signed up to nearly all of these guidelines, whereas Japan has only signed up to 43. In order to also be able to supply car parts to the Japanese market with unfettered access, it is actually a basic prerequisite that Japan, too, should sign up to these UN conventions. If I consider, now, the tax breaks enjoyed by environmentally friendly vehicles, I can see that, in Japan, these depend solely on test cycle JC08. Logic dictates, however, that this cycle is not adhered to by vehicles that we produce here, as we test according to a different cycle, the European driving cycle. It needs to be ensured that the same tax benefits for environmentally friendly vehicles – we define these as vehicles emitting below 90 grams of CO2
 per kilometre – are ensured for European vehicles in Japan, too, without jeopardising the standard by so doing. Of course, traders must also have the opportunity to offer their cars for sale in Japan, and to have them maintained in workshops there. Current property law does not provide for that. So, then, we need a tougher re-presentation of the scoping exercise and clear guidelines from Parliament. That is why we are calling on the Council to wait until September to issue a mandate, that is, until Parliament has drawn up clear guidelines for a mandate for trade relations with Japan.

 Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, I, too, would like to thank the rapporteur, Mr Fjellner, and also the shadow rapporteur, Mr Martin, and the other shadow rapporteurs. They really have succeeded in negotiating a good compromise. I also call for us to pass this compromise with the largest possible majority, as there has been real success here in granting these unilateral advantages in a more targeted way. The EU’s trade policy, after all, is oft-criticised. In this area, however, it is clear that we are granting unilateral advantages to the poorest and next-to-poorest countries in the world, so that they can bolster their development on the back of these advantages. We will now be making this more targeted, and that is exactly the right approach to take. With the GSP+ countries, we are inviting them – on the basis of common values in relation to human rights and sustainability – to intensify trade relations with us still further. This also helps to strengthen sustainable development on the global level. Here too, then, what we have is a reasonable approach. We have also ensured, however, that there are not sudden distortions in our industrial relations. In that connection, we have incorporated appropriate safety nets in those areas in which there is a competitive environment for our industrial products, so that we can very confidently say that we are granting unilateral advantages without jeopardising any jobs within the European Union. For those countries that will be leaving the GSP scheme, it goes without saying that the door is not closed. We invite all of them to conclude intensive trade relations with us – be it via bilateral trade negotiations, through the WTO, or through economic partnership agreements (EPAs) – with the aim of bringing about sustainable development.

 Mr President, Mr De Gucht, I believe it is clear that trade is not an end in itself but a means of improving people’s living conditions. A glance at the situation in Colombia and Peru shows that the process of improving living conditions there involves major challenges. Against this background, Parliament is, of course, investigating very carefully, on the basis of the rights granted to it under the Treaty of Lisbon, whether this trade agreement with Colombia and Peru meets these requirements. It is very unlikely that the trade agreement alone will be able to overcome these challenges. The issues include the extent to which civil society is included in the process of implementing the trade agreement, the independence of its involvement and the options for instigating complaint procedures. There is also the question of the restrictions placed on efforts to implement the sustainability chapter. Article 267 and Article 277 specify the possible restrictions relating to material resources. We believe it is necessary for us to enter into additional agreements with the Colombian and the Peruvian governments so that we can be certain that the trade agreement will bring about significant improvements in the living conditions of the people. One aspect of this involves improving the employment rights of people who are working in the informal sector. Around 58% of people in Colombia, for example, are employed in the informal sector and their working conditions are quite different from those of people with formal jobs. The question of how the interests of workers are represented must be reconsidered, in particular, in the light of International Labour Organisation (ILO) Conventions 129 and 135. Job security and social dialogue also need to be improved in line with ILO Convention 144. The United States and Switzerland have put in place action plans to accompany their free trade agreements and we should follow their example. Bernd Lange  (S&amp;D

 Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, you will have noticed from Mr Lambsdorff’s remarks that the issue here is not an objective debate, but rather the elections in Germany. All I can say here is that for a party on the political defensive, a debate like this, with so many wrong-headed arguments, may be one way to stay afloat. However this is to ignore the facts. The situation in Germany is that the government supported by Mr Lambsdorff’s party already levies a tax rate on diesel above the future minimum tax rate. At present, we have a minimum tax rate of EUR 0.33 in Germany, which would be increased to EUR 0.41; however, the German Government already takes EUR 0.47. In other words, there would be no immediate change. Thus, it is wrong to say that the price of diesel fuel will sky-rocket in the morning. The second point is proportionality. We Social Democrats have always said that proportionality is not unconditional. We have tabled Amendment 15 precisely with this in mind. We must not drive the diesel engine to extinction through taxation. We Social Democrats proposed this amendment, which the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs was happy to adopt. But what happens next? Obviously our Liberal and Conservative colleagues distrust their own governments because the definition of the absolute tax rate is still a matter for the Member States and their governments. The level of distrust is so great that they believe that if this resolution is adopted, the governments they support will increase diesel taxes. That is why I can understand it when people say that this distrust will result in the rejection of proportionality. If your distrust really is so great, then I believe it is right to reject proportionality in this case. I have one final word to add. If everyone is suddenly a supporter of diesel, then I find myself wondering why these governments are not moving to switch from taxing cars to taxing CO2
 emissions, benefiting the more economical diesel engine. You can do this immediately without consulting Europe. What is stopping you? Bernd Lange  (S&amp;D

Blue-card question.

Mr Seeber, I have a supplementary question. Are you unaware that we Social Democrats tabled an amendment in the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs drawing attention to precisely this problem – namely, that this could lead to problems with industrial policy and the questioning of the CO2
 reduction strategy for cars – and that this amendment was adopted by the Economic Affairs Committee? Bernd Lange  (S&amp;D

 Mr President, Mr Mato Adrover, I see things in a fundamentally different way. This agreement cannot be compared with the fisheries agreement. In the case of the fisheries agreement, it was not clear where the money paid by the European Union would be going. In this case we have clear rules about who benefits from the money – and the beneficiaries really are Moroccan producers – as well as about European investments into Morocco. With that being the case, the situation is completely different. It is also completely clear that, with this agreement, we are not legitimising the situation in Western Sahara. On the contrary, we are saying clearly that a solution needs to be found in the interests of the people. We are also making that clear with our resolution. We cannot, however, send out a signal to the Arab Spring that we will always seal off our markets per se. We do need to offer solutions for fair trade so that there really can be change through trade. It also means that, if there really are distortions in the European Union in agriculture, we need to ensure, within the EU, that our farmers also have development perspectives. We cannot simply close our borders, however. That would be a signal that would heighten the sense of disappointment in the Arab Spring. For these reasons I will recommend to Members in my group that they vote in favour of this agreement. Bernd Lange,  
rapporteur for the opinion of the Committee on International Trade

 Mr President, Mr Bütikofer, I too wish to start by expressing my thanks for this ambitious report and the huge amount of work it has entailed. Mr Tajani, raw materials policy is essential to the development of European industry. The trade dimension is decisive, which is why I believe it is right for raw materials policy to be anchored in an international context from the perspective of industrial policy in Europe. A number of points are key here: If we intend to secure our supply of raw materials in the world by means of partnership agreements, we can only do this by ensuring that the businesses that extract these raw materials also conduct themselves in a reasonable way. It is unacceptable for European businesses to evade tax or for workers to be required to work under inhuman conditions. That is why it is clear that if we intend to mine raw materials, then businesses need to comply with clear social and environmental standards. Secondly, we must also ensure that the raw materials that we use do not come from crisis regions and are not used to finance groups who use the money earned from raw materials to fund civil war. We need an international certification system for the extraction of raw materials and for tracing trade, so that we can tell where raw materials come from. By the way, excellent footprints can be found for raw materials everywhere. Thirdly, we must ensure that we do not export raw materials illegally. In our own interests, we need to close any loopholes in our legislation – this last remark is addressed to Mr Florenz. However, we also need to improve controls. The system will never work if a single individual is to be required to ensure controls in a large European port. Exports need closer monitoring and it is necessary to ensure that monopolistic and oligopolistic structures in raw materials trade are eliminated. The good news, Commissioner, is that the Commission is moving in the right direction. Bernd Lange  (S&amp;D

 Mr President, Commissioner, we all firmly believe that we must help the people in Pakistan, but the instrument that you are proposing, Commissioner, is the wrong one, for three reasons. The first is that there is absolutely no proof that trade facilitation will benefit the people affected by the floods. On the contrary, we can even see that the textile industry in Pakistan is based in other regions and, in recent years, has even experienced growth. Thus, this sector is not really affected at all. How we intend to help the people affected by the floods by means of trade facilitation is beyond me. Secondly, I cannot understand how we can now grant these facilitations to a country that plainly does not meet the GSP+ conditions in terms of social and environmental standards and send a signal to other countries, like Bangladesh, which do meet these conditions, that essentially tells them that their efforts are not wanted and it is also possible to achieve this status by other means. My third argument, Commissioner, is that this is not an approach based on solidarity, because the burden in Europe is borne in a one-sided manner by certain sectors and certain countries only. If we want to do something, then we should do so in a spirit of solidarity with all countries and with the involvement of everyone, and that means we need direct aid for the flood victims. That would be the right approach to take. Bernd Lange  (S&amp;D
).

 Madam President, Commissioner, I really do think it is important that, following the entry into force of the Treaty of Lisbon, we decide on the structure of the negotiations together, because this Treaty gives Parliament a new role in trade relations. If we once again consider the fact that India is clearly a market of the future, we must also feed this back into a clear position adopted by Parliament: In our view, industrial development in the European Union – linked to jobs – is of key importance. We therefore need to make it clear that the interests of jobs in industry in Europe must take priority in the trade agreements. For that reason, although an agreement has to be asymmetrical, at the end of the day, the tariffs must be zero. It is not acceptable for us to have tariffs of 100% in mechanical engineering and the automotive sector and, in the end, perhaps negotiate 50%. As long as we do not have any zero tariffs, it will encourage investments outside Europe. Therefore, Commissioner, we need to clearly define our priority areas and they lie in industry. We also need a level playing field to be established with regard to social standards, and it is also necessary for clear obligations to be imposed on India in relation to workers’ rights. Bernd Lange  (S&amp;D

Madam President, I am somewhat disappointed that Parliament was unable to approve this by a majority today in order to learn sensible lessons from the reactor disaster in Japan. I consider it beyond question that this must mean organising a clear shift in energy policy away from nuclear energy – in order words, the beginning of a phase-out – at European level. Secondly, it should also be obvious that if we carry out stress tests, then any nuclear power plant that fails these tests is required to be removed from the grid. Neither of these proposals received a majority in the vote. I was therefore unable to support the resolution. I hope that we will soon succeed in organising a uniform energy policy that provides us with safe and sensible energy in the future, which means movement towards energy efficiency and renewable energies.

 Madam President, Mr Tajani, ladies and gentlemen, this report presents the position of the European Parliament very clearly. I would like thank the shadow rapporteurs who have contributed to the report and the rapporteurs for the opinion of the relevant committees. Together, we have succeeded in conveying a clear message, Mr Tajani, which is that we want to move industrial policy closer to the centre of the political arena, for good reason. Industrial policy will help us, firstly, to create good quality, future-proof jobs in Europe and, secondly, to secure investment in Europe. Our competitors all over the world are making good use of industrial policy, for example, in the United States, China, Brazil and India. Thirdly, we are faced with challenges relating to sustainability, both in terms of the climate and the economic and social foundations of our society. Against this background, it is important for us to put industrial policy at the centre of the political arena. On the one hand, this means that we expect industrial policy to be integrated in such a way, Mr Tajani, that it becomes the focal point of legislative initiatives within the European Union. We do not want to see environmental, trade and competition policies being drawn up first and only subsequently being coordinated with the interests of European industry. On the contrary, we must define the other areas of policy on the basis of the strategic interests of a sustainable industrial policy. Secondly, Mr Tajani, we need better coordination between the industrial policies in the different Member States. Therefore, I would like to ask you, and we have included this in the report, to make use of Article 173(2) of the Treaty of Lisbon, in order to coordinate industrial policy in the Member States more effectively, so that we really are all moving in the same direction. We must, of course, focus on a number of specific areas. On the horizontal level, we need to look, in particular, at innovation policy throughout the entire value-added chain. We must succeed in supporting the entire economic chain, from fundamental research through to the market launch of products, and in bringing the best solutions for our society onto the market. We also need to pay more attention to resources. Simply saying that this is important is not enough. We need to introduce practical legislation which will significantly increase resource productivity. In industry, labour is responsible for 20% of costs and resources for 40%. That is a starting point for action on raw materials. The mobile phones that we all use contain rare earths and metals, which are seldom recycled. The recycling rate for mobile phones is only 1.5%. That is a starting point for creating jobs and increasing the competitiveness of European industry. I would like to make one last point in this context. Innovation and resource productivity will not happen by themselves. They depend on the employees who are involved. For this reason, a sensible industrial policy must also take into consideration the skills and the involvement of employees. If we can bring this about, then I am confident that we will have future-proof jobs in European industry. Bernd Lange,  
rapporteur.
 – (DE)
 Madam President, Mr Tajani, ladies and gentlemen, thank you very much for your many inspiring contributions. Mr Tajani, the four key messages which bring us together are clear. Firstly, we want to ensure that industrial policy lies at the heart of EU policy. Secondly, we want to link together sustainability and competitiveness and develop them further. Thirdly, we must not take a dogmatic approach, because this area cannot be regulated by the market alone or by the state alone. We need practical, sensible measures. Fourthly, this is just the beginning and not the end of the discussion on modernising industrial policy in the European Union. We are extending a hand to you, Mr Tajani, but we are also aware that we must take you at your word. We are expecting concrete legislative proposals and also concrete measures to provide financial support, particularly in the field of research. Mr Tajani, if we are successful, and if the hand that we are extending to you and the statement that you have made are compatible, perhaps we will find ourselves in a situation similar to that at the end of the wonderful film ‘Casablanca’, when Humphrey Bogart says to the police captain: ‘I think this is the beginning of a beautiful friendship!’ Bernd Lange,

 Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, the Treaty of Lisbon has in fact put trade policy on a new footing. The EU is solely responsible for trade policy and Parliament gives or withholds its consent. In that respect, we have gained a new responsibility. We can only enable this new responsibility to take shape if we act together. We have proven that very clearly in this matter. In this regard, I would also like to thank the rapporteurs and shadow rapporteurs. Trade policy is not an end in itself. Its purpose is, firstly, to strengthen jobs and industrial development in the European Union and, secondly, to improve conditions for people in other countries of the world. The aim of trade policy must be to achieve both of these goals. We therefore need to assess this agreement from this viewpoint. Overall, this is a step in the right direction towards fulfilling these two requirements. However, we certainly do have a few points of criticism, for example the question of duty drawback in South Korea, which will bring one-sided competitive advantages for certain sectors of industry in South Korea, particularly in sensitive areas such as the automotive industry. It was therefore right for us to have very intensive talks about a safeguard clause and also to have jointly implemented such a clause, which provides for the close monitoring of precisely these points, so that we can be certain that the possibilities provided by duty drawback in South Korea do not lead to a distortion of competition in Europe. Parliament has rightly established safeguards here. Secondly, this agreement also has the purpose of improving the situation in South Korea for our colleagues there. South Korea still has improvements to make with regard to Chapter 13, in particular the question of the core labour standards laid down by the ILO. Two absolutely crucial core labour standards – No 87 and No 98, relating to collective bargaining – have not be implemented or ratified. Section 314 of the penal code relates to the obstruction of business. Neither of these things is in line with the nature and the provisions of this agreement. Thus, Commissioner, I am relying on you, and on the statement that you have given in support of the safeguard clause, to change this situation in South Korea so that this agreement will represent a blueprint for the future to enable globalisation to proceed in a fair manner. Bernd Lange,

 Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, I would first like to add my thanks to the rapporteur for the good cooperation that has helped Parliament unanimously adopt an extremely fundamental position in Committee – which is very much to be welcomed – and which has once again made clear the significance of this safeguard regulation. Together with the agreement with South Korea, this is the first agreement that we have negotiated following the entry into force of the Treaty of Lisbon, which gave Parliament a new role that it must play. Secondly, this Free Trade Agreement with South Korea and the safeguard regulation are also something of a blueprint for future agreements, and to this extent, we must tread particularly carefully here. These are two important reasons why we should not nonchalantly adopt diluted positions, but should really fight for prudent regulations to be adopted. As you are aware, Commissioner, there are six points that we are particularly concerned about here. I would like to give a brief recap of what these are. Firstly, the duty drawback mechanism. If Korean manufacturers use parts from third countries when manufacturing their goods, they do not have to pay duty on these and can export them to Europe, while European manufacturers – even if they use the same parts – do not enjoy this exemption from duty. This therefore provides Korean manufacturers with a competitive advantage. This must be closely monitored to see whether it gives rise to distortion of the market. That cannot be achieved by means of a simple declaration; rather, it must be made legally binding by including it in the safeguard regulation as a basis for initiating investigations. Secondly, there will also be regional variation. The sensitive sectors are not all represented equally strongly in all the Member States. Consequently, we must pay particular attention to how sensitive sectors in individual regions can be protected from targeted assaults. That is no simple task, because we are in an internal market – but a political solution must be found. Thirdly, as this is the first agreement since the Treaty of Lisbon, Commissioner, it also involves a new balance between the Council and Parliament; and since we have also reached agreement with the Commission, it is only right that an equal role for Parliament and the Council is anchored in the agreement. Fourthly, the implementation processes are, of course, your business – we have no desire to interfere with the operational implementation – but as Parliament we must ensure that Parliament’s rights are not brought into question in the comitology procedure. In particular, we need a right of withdrawal – this, too, must be ensured. My fifth point is that many decades of experience with South Korea has shown us that in addition to tariff trade policy, non-tariff barriers to trade are constantly being constructed. We must therefore also have a clear mechanism for monitoring, reporting and initiating consultations should problems arise in the area of non-tariff barriers to trade. My sixth point is that if we are serious about this new kind of trade agreement, then we must also involve and strengthen civil society. This means that fundamental ILO standards – such as standard 87, which grants workers the right to strike – need to be firmly rooted and implemented. In contrast, Article 314 of South Korea’s penal code states that ‘Interfering with the smooth running of the business’ is a criminal offence. We need to do something about this – civil society must be strengthened, fundamental ILO standards and fundamental environmental standards must be ensured, and civil society must also be involved in the monitoring of the agreement in the form of the Domestic Advisory Groups. My final point, Commissioner, is that you said that provisional application will most likely occur once agreement has been reached. I would like to delete this ‘most likely’. Provisional application cannot take place until Parliament has reached a decision on this matter! (Applause) Bernd Lange  (S&amp;D

Mr President, President-in-Office of the Council, Commissioner, I, too, would like to thank the Spanish Presidency and also the Commission for bringing the subject of electromobility to the fore. I also believe that we can use electromobility to revitalise the mobility economy in Europe, and we need to do that in order to create value and to safeguard jobs. However – to use another metaphor – we need to step on the accelerator, because the issue of electromobility affects many policy areas. There is, of course, the issue of standardisation, technology, but also the question of the integration of electromobility into the whole transport system, because we may need new forms of mobility, particularly in urban areas. Energy must be renewable and we need raw materials, so trade is also affected. Therefore, I would ask you, Commissioner, to perhaps integrate electromobility further in the follow-on from Cars 21.

 Mr President, in the opinion of the Committee on Industry, Research and Energy, it is, of course, also important to protect small and medium-sized enterprises. Commissioner, competition is not an end in itself. If we look at the situation of small dealerships and small workshops, we need to increase their economic ability to act, otherwise one day we will only have large dealerships and large workshop chains. This includes, firstly, genuine authorisation for multi-branding. It includes allowing workshops and dealerships to have unrestricted access to information on vehicles and repair options. Thirdly, it includes providing the necessary opportunities for gaining qualifications. We talked earlier about electromobility. They also need to be in a position to maintain electric cars. Fourthly, they need investment security, in other words contractual protection and no more revisions. They need to be able to make safe investments over a long period. Bernd Lange,  
deputising for the author.

 Mr President, Commissioner, I have three questions on my mind. The first is, why are we still lacking transparency when the Treaty of Lisbon has been in force since 1 December and we have had an interinstitutional agreement with the Commission since 10 February? I cannot understand why it is still the case that the Council is sitting at the table as an observer in the negotiations, Parliament is not involved and the documents are not publicly accessible. So why is this, Commissioner? The second question that is of concern to me is this: who is actually negotiating the ACTA Agreement? This is not being negotiated as some sort of follow-up agreement to TRIPS within the framework of the World Trade Organisation. It is only being negotiated by individual States and – as we hear from the United States – also by powerful economic interests. I ask myself whether, in fact, standards are not being set which will ultimately apply to everyone even though not everyone is sitting round the negotiating table. The third question that is troubling me, Commissioner, is this: what actually is the substance of the negotiations? In your hearing, you answered my question and assured me that the acquis communautaire
 was secure. However, when I look at individual papers that have leaked out I unfortunately have my doubts about this. I understand that negotiations are being held, that blocks on the Internet are possible, that providers are to be used, so to speak, to help police the Internet for economic interests, that restrictions on research and science may sometimes be imposed and that some people are even trying to introduce general surveillance systems. I therefore ask myself, where in all this is the acquis communautaire
? There is also the question of compensation. The fact that the inclusion of lost profit in the compensation is being negotiated is not appropriate for our policy. Of course, my third question, Commissioner, is what is the actual relationship between online and offline? When I read that online and offline are both supposed to represent the digital world, does that essentially mean that there are also to be restrictions and searches of laptops, iPods and MP3 players at borders? Would you please provide answers to these three questions. Bernd Lange  (S&amp;D

 Mr President, Commissioner, we all know that GSP is a good system and that GSP+ is a very good system. We also need to ensure their extension and so we need your proposal so that we can have a proper debate in Parliament. So, Commissioner, please speed things up. Even for GSP+, we may be able to introduce a few improvements. In this regard, there are five points that I would like to make concerning areas where we may be able to make further improvements. Firstly, who determines how the 27 standards are actually implemented, not only recognised in practice, but formally implemented? Is that the task of the ILO alone, or do we not need an assessment committee to provide specific support during implementation? Secondly, how are we involving civil society? I would like to see the coordination of civil society in the country in question in the assessment of the implementation of GSP+, just as we have now agreed in the agreement with South Korea. Thirdly, who actually initiates an investigation if any problems are detected? Parliament needs to be involved here, because I have the feeling that, in the Council, interests other than actually having an investigation carried out come into play. Parliament should also initiate an investigation in this connection. We surely also need clear structures for the next steps that we are to take as well as clearer structures for withdrawal, but perhaps we can talk about this in detail another time. Bernd Lange  (S&amp;D
). 
 – (DE)
 Mr President, Mr De Gucht, I have three questions for you. My first question concerns the need for fair competition conditions. The fact that employees’ rights in South Korea are restricted means that there are unfair competitive conditions, which include the question of collective action. Paragraph 314 of the South Korean Criminal Code refers to the crime of ‘disrupting operations’. This is used to prevent strikes and to limit the rights of trade unions, for example, in the case of Ssangyong. I would also like to know why we are concluding free trade agreements with countries such as South Korea and Colombia which have the most problems with the standards of the International Labour Organisation. Therefore, my first question is this: How do you propose to use the free trade agreement to ensure that there are no unfair competition conditions in South Korea caused by restrictions on employees’ rights? My second question relates to the problems in the car industry, which several other speakers have also referred to. It is very important in this case that there are sensible safeguard clauses. General safeguard clauses are currently in place for major market disruptions and for the duty drawback system. I am not able to understand this fully. Mr De Gucht, perhaps you could explain the safeguard clauses to me in simple terms. I would particularly like to know who can trigger them and when. My third question concerns the new contractual basis for our cooperation introduced by the Treaty of Lisbon. This includes approving safeguard clauses and implementation as part of the codecision process. Can you guarantee that the free trade agreement will not be put into force until Parliament has approved this procedure and only after Parliament has exercised its rights and adopted the safeguard clauses? Bernhard Rapkay,  
rapporteur.
 – (DE)
 Mr President, I would like to just briefly explain the motion to postpone the debate. As you know, we held a number of rounds of negotiations with the Council about the unitary patent quite some time ago, and we reached a joint result at the end of November last year. The package consists of three parts: the patent regulation itself via the codecision procedure, the implementing regulation via the consultation procedure and a third area, consisting of an intergovernmental agreement. We reached an agreed result and, on 2 December last year, the chair of the Committee on Legal Affairs, Mr Lehne, received a letter from the Presidency of the Council containing the agreed text and a covering letter in which the Council committed to adopt exactly the enclosed text if Parliament adopted exactly what we had negotiated and agreed as well. For seven months, nothing has happened, as the Council has failed to get its act together on another matter, namely, the issue of where the seat of the central division of the patent court should be. This issue is not within our competence, however, and accordingly we have not got involved. There were three interested parties in this dispute, and in the last week the Council has decided, in its wisdom – something about which we are all aware – that all three interested parties will be getting the nod. That is not the crucial point, however, for which reason there is clearly cause to wonder whether what we have here is something of an oriental bazaar, but that would be an unfair insult to the serious traders of oriental bazaars. The problem is that it was also agreed to interfere in Parliament’s competences and to delete something from the regulation itself, specifically, three key articles. Coreper will be meeting tomorrow morning at 09.00 and formalising what the Heads of State or Government have agreed. It plans to then present us with that new text at 10.30 so that we can hold a debate on the basis of the new text in the afternoon, followed by a vote on Wednesday. This is a blatant violation of our agreement, and I believe that this is the first time this has happened in the history of our negotiations, informal trialogues, with the Council. This is not acceptable, Mr President, and that is why we are requesting that the item be taken off the agenda. (Applause)
 We are moving to have the item taken off the agenda as we cannot allow what I have just outlined to happen. Should Coreper decide tomorrow to adopt what is before me now, we will still have to discuss how we can move forward with this dossier all in all. Mr President, in order to avoid any interested parties getting the wrong impression, however, I want to make it clear that this is not just about this procedural issue, it is about a fundamental content-related issue. In many people’s view – including that of the Council in the negotiations themselves in the course of the last year – the removal of the three articles that has now been decided on is a blatant violation of European law. It is important to be aware of this. They want a regulation and a regulation should regulate something. They want to take out the regulatory content, in other words, exactly the things that are supposed to be regulated. That is remarkable in itself and it is why we have to take this item off the agenda at all events. Bernhard Rapkay,  
rapporteur
. – (DE)
 Mr President, I would just like to say one thing regarding the debate previously mentioned on the immunity of Mr de Magistris, as I am also rapporteur in that case. I would like to point out that no debate on this has been included in the agenda, only a vote. I would also like to point that there are proceedings being brought against Mr de Magistris on a total of five accounts. This is only about one of these that is relatively uncontroversial. As regards the other accounts, we will first hear what Mr de Magistris has to say. Bernhard Rapkay,  
rapporteur
. – (DE)
 Mr President, I just wanted to clarify that, because some Members asked about it earlier. With regard to the defence of the parliamentary immunity of Viktor Uspaskich I have to say that this is not in fact what it is about. Mr Uspaskich does not have parliamentary immunity. Parliament waived Mr Uspaskich’s parliamentary immunity on 7 September 2010 – in other words, more than a year ago – and that situation has not changed. On the contrary, Mr Uspaskich has asked for his immunity to be reinstated on the basis of new information that he claims to have. What is the issue here? Mr Uspaskich is accused by the Lithuanian law enforcement authorities of having contravened party law and tax law in Lithuania during the period from 2004 to 2006 when he was chair of his party. He was not a Member of this House between 2004 and 2006. He was, however, a member of the Seimas (the Lithuanian Parliament). In 2008, the Seimas waived his immunity. He was then elected to the European Parliament in 2009, where he obviously received immunity once again. Then we had to deal with the matter. He was heard in Parliament twice. I want to make this point, because he always claims that he had no opportunity to present his case. He had two hearings in committee. I do not know whether Mr Uspaskich is guilty or whether he is innocent. He always maintains that he is innocent. I do not know. However, it is not my job, nor is it your job, to decide. It is the job of the judicial authorities in the Member State of Lithuania to decide. We simply have to determine whether two particular aspects to this case are such that his immunity, which he naturally has as a Member of the European Parliament, should be retained and that he should be subject to a different procedure to that of any normal citizen of his country. We have come to the conclusion that this is not the case. One aspect relates to the question of whether, through such proceedings, he is prevented from expressing his free political opinion as an MEP – but contravention of tax legislation actually has nothing to do with freedom of expression. The second aspect relates to the fact that, as a result of these proceedings, he is persecuted to a certain extent in his political activities. That is something that gives cause for consideration. However, after careful deliberation – following two hearings and after questioning the Lithuanian authorities once again – we reached the conclusion that this was not the case either. Thus, there was nothing else that we could do except waive his immunity. Mr Uspaskich then went to the Court of Justice of the European Union – as he is entitled to do – to the General Court, and brought an action for the annulment of our decision and for the suspension of the decision until the hearing for the main case. Of course, the Court of Justice of the European Union accepted this, but it rejected the application for a temporary order. Mr Uspaskich then declared that he had new information. Apparently, in WikiLeaks facts were published that confirm his position, and he is therefore asking for the case to be considered once again. He also said that he would withdraw his application to the court. I advised him most strongly against doing that. This is the only route that will enable him to obtain his right in court. I strongly advised him not to do it, but he nevertheless withdrew his appeal to the court. We then discussed the new facts in another hearing and came to the conclusion that these new facts may perhaps be relevant to the proceedings themselves in Lithuania, but not to the decision concerning the waiving of his immunity. We discussed the matter in detail, debating it for and against in several sittings, and we came to the firm conclusion that there is no other option: as we are not deciding on guilt or innocence here, but only on whether he has privileged access, we have to conclude that neither the first point, regarding ‘the free expression of his political opinion’, nor the second point, namely ‘political persecution’ are relevant here. There therefore remains nothing else for us to do but to maintain his immunity waiver. We are not making a decision to withdraw his immunity because it has already been withdrawn. Thus, in the report we conclude that his immunity should remain withdrawn. Bernhard Rapkay,

 Mr President, I am, of course, also speaking as rapporteur, because I have been involved with this matter for a long time. I have not done this for the pleasure of it, nor was I particularly keen on doing it. However, what we have just heard is not proof that the majority in committee were wrong the first time and again the second time. Nothing – absolutely nothing – has been put forward that indicates that. I am not making a judgment with regard to the role that Mr Uspaskich plays in politics in Lithuania. That is not my job. It is not your job, either. This issue here is: is he getting a fair trial or not? You will have to prove to me that he is not getting a fair trial. This proof has not been provided. Mr Tomaševski, please refrain from making comments about Bolshevists and similar things. That has more of an effect of disqualifying you rather than helping to establish the truth. Just to make it clear once again: the issue here is not for us to say whether he is guilty or not guilty. It is a matter of whether his right to free expression is being restricted or whether he is being politically persecuted. We came to the conclusion that neither of these are the case. That is the reason for our decision in committee and why this report states what it does. I can only recommend that plenary also votes in favour of our report as a whole. Bernhard Rapkay,  
on behalf of the S&amp;D Group.

 Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, the explanatory statement from the rapporteur is quite correct and needs no amplification. For this reason, my group will give its consent to enhanced cooperation. There were also some contrary opinions among us – this is quite legitimate and these voices should be heard. However, what the rapporteur, Council Presidency and Commissioner have had to say shows that the time has really come and that we cannot drag our feet any longer. It is not the case, as some people claim, that this has all been agreed in haste without any discussion – like many of the other arguments, this is patently untrue. The language issue did not just become the subject of debate when the Commission presented its last proposal last year; this has been under discussion for a decade or more. There is nothing new about it. Anyone who looks at how different models have been presented and discussed in recent months cannot say that there has not been sufficient discussion. It is time to cut the Gordian knot! The second argument always used here is that we risk destroying the internal market. The fact is that we do not have an internal market where patents are concerned, so we cannot really destroy it. If – as has been the case for a long time – we are clear about the fact that the internal market really does need a uniform patent process in order to reach completion, then the entire internal market cannot be destroyed by this move. In the worst case scenario, things would remain as they are. I do believe that we will make progress, however. The third specific argument used is that Parliament would weaken its rights by consenting to enhanced cooperation: none of this is true. I would advise you to take a look at the Treaty of Lisbon and our Rules of Procedure. We will not relinquish a single right. We are now approving enhanced cooperation and, when this begins, we shall all have our individual rights. With regard to the language regime, of course this is simply a matter of consultation, since unanimity is required here. Codecision should apply to the actual patent regulation and the approval of patent jurisdiction, however. We are not relinquishing a single right, quite the opposite in fact. Bernhard Rapkay,  
rapporteur.

 Madam President, Mr Almunia, ladies and gentlemen, firstly, I would like to congratulate you, Mr Almunia, and your offices. The impact assessment that you have presented is very good. It is based on facts, it is conclusive and it gets to the point. It is a pity that the other members of the College of Commissioners have not read this impact assessment, because if they had read it, they would not have been able to present this proposal, which has nothing at all to do with the impact assessment. I wonder how the College of Commissioners picked the year, for example. There is absolutely no mention of this in the impact assessment. The only thing which might explain it is that 2014 is exactly halfway between 2010 and 2018. That is what it must be. However, it may be that they have also not understood the content. None of the arguments in favour of this proposal can be seriously considered because they are not correct. There is the argument that the State aid scheme adopted in 2002, which is about to expire, was a phasing out arrangement for coal mining. Of course, this is totally incorrect. It was a successor arrangement. I know this, because I was there and I was the rapporteur for Parliament in 2002. This is when the Treaty establishing the European Coal and Steel Community (ECSC) expired after 50 years and a successor arrangement was needed, not only with regard to aid, but also other issues. If this had been a phasing out arrangement, what would have happened, for example, to the ECSC’s assets? It was not a phasing out arrangement, it was a successor arrangement. At the time, we agreed with good reason on a period of eight years for this successor arrangement, after which we would look at the issue again. Therefore, this argument is incorrect. The second argument which is put forward is the question of sustainability. We are all in favour of this and we know that coal, of course, produces large quantities of CO2
 emissions. However, a decision made by the Commission cannot abolish the laws of science. What will happen next? Domestic coal will be replaced by imported coal. That is the only thing that will happen. Imported coal emits just the same amount of CO2
 as domestic coal. The problem is simply that if we no longer have reference points, we will not be able to use them in the development of new, state-of-the-art technologies for mining and power stations. Europe is a leader in this area and has an export advantage. I do not believe that we should just give this up. The third argument is that aid is harmful and that the money would be better spent on other things. It is not possible to say anything against this argument or against the attitude of market radicals. You cannot oppose an ideology with facts. However, the statement that this would be too expensive, for example, should be looked at in the light of what it would really mean if mining were to be stopped abruptly, and 2014 would be an abrupt stop. It would result in an increase in the costs of combating unemployment and, above all, in the costs relating to long-term pit closures. This is a very complicated and complex subject. The costs of long-term pit closures continue to be incurred years and even decades after coal mining comes to an end. The costs have to be paid out of the public purse. However, some Member States have a system in place which ensures that the state is not responsible for these costs. Therefore, this argument also does not hold water. For this reason, I recommend that you think this over again as soon as possible and that you pay attention to what is said in the impact assessment. Otherwise, the result will be regional and socio-political distortions, which we do not want. This is why the 2018 proposal is highly sensible. Bernhard Rapkay,  
rapporteur.
 – (DE)
 Madam President, Mr Almunia, that is exactly the problem. You are right when you confirm to Mr Lange that it is a Council regulation. However, it also depends on whether the Commission hears the arguments put forward in the Council and here in Parliament. You must drop this very stringent proposal, as you have done, so that it is possible for a sensible, democratic approach to be taken, which involves a majority decision that does not require unanimity. I would like to make a second remark to Mr Chatzimarkakis. The review clause which you referred to is completely irrelevant in this case. The disputes which took place in Germany were only intended to save the face of the Minister for Economic Affairs there, nothing more. Now, I would like to look at the concern expressed by Mr Almunia. No one here and not even the report itself is questioning the fact that this is a phasing out arrangement, Mr Almunia. Whether it is sensible in terms of energy policy or technology is another question. What Mr Geier said is absolutely correct, but we are not calling that into question. The only question is whether we should do this relatively abruptly in 2014 or whether there are sensible transitional arrangements for 2018. Otherwise, we are not questioning anything. The situation is not as described by Mr Lambert, for example, who read out his speech and then left. He should have stayed here, because he might have learned something. It is not the case that there are Member States who have done nothing at all. That is not true of Spain, of Poland, of Romania or of Germany. In 1990, more than 200 000 people were working in the mining industry in Germany. Now, 20 years later, the figure is around 20 000. This represents a drop of 90%, leaving only 10% of the jobs still in place. There have been a number of pit closures between 2002 and the present day during the period of this regulation, which is still in force. Let us not behave as if nothing has happened. The question is whether or not we need a sensible transitional period to be able to achieve this without causing socio-political damage. I can only say, yes, we do need one. This four-year period should not be an issue, because no one is calling that into question anyway. Please take that message back to the Commission. Bernhard Rapkay,  
rapporteur.
 – (DE)
 Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, and when I say ‘ladies and gentlemen’, I include you, Baroness Ashton, Mr Šefčovič, your team and the Council Presidency, because, at the end of the day, we experienced collegial cooperation, without which we would surely not have achieved the result that we did. I am happy with the result, at least as regards the part for which I was responsible and where I had a grasp of the overall picture. However, I would say that this is not so very surprising, because it is not as if we have only just started. Mr President, it was a very clever idea of yours to call all the rapporteurs together on a regular basis for an exchange of ideas right from an early stage – back at the time of the Brok, Verhofstadt and Gualtieri reports. As a result, for the relevant people, it was clear what would need to be done later, and for those who were to do this later work, it was clear what had already been done in terms of preparatory work. For this reason, it was primarily a matter of applying to the Staff Regulations the organisational aspects of what had been agreed between Parliament and the Council in connection with the establishment of the European External Action Service in the particular areas of competence covered by these Staff Regulations. When I say organisational, I mean that organisation is policy and policy is organisation. That is, of course, something that we found repeatedly during the detailed negotiations, because it was already clear at that point that perhaps one person may interpret something one way and others may interpret it somewhat differently. However, the spirit of cooperation resulted, I believe, in us finding very sensible solutions to such issues. What did we actually need to do, then, in terms of policy adjustment and what did we need to lay down in the Staff Regulations? Firstly, we had to incorporate the equal treatment of the three staffing components. I want to mention this point because, as you know, the treaty states that the staff of the EEAS shall comprise officials from the Commission, the Council and from the diplomatic services of the Member States. The last of these elements, in particular, did pose something of an issue, as it was something new. We had to resolve the almost antagonistic contradiction between the Community approach and the intergovernmental approach. It goes without saying that the Council and the Member States take more of an intergovernmental approach, while we prefer the Community approach. I believe I can say that we then worked out a solution to this together. To that extent, then, we can be very satisfied. What we needed, and indeed must continue, to take into account is gender balance and a balance in terms of geographical origin. We want to have a service that is modern, including with regard to the issue of gender equality. I am pleased, Baroness Ashton, that, in addition to what we have incorporated into the Staff Regulations as mandatory, you have assured us that you will make another personal statement, which will form part of the whole package. That already represents considerable progress with regard to both the aspect of gender equality and the other aspect of geographical balance. We need equal rights and equal obligations, and that includes loyalty – and indeed from all three components – towards the institution of the High Representative, currently embodied by Baroness Ashton. In this regard, we had a bit of additional work to do as far as the veto right of the diplomatic services was concerned in connection with possible extensions to the contracts of staff coming from the diplomatic services. However, we resolved this, too. There is one issue that should not be underestimated. We jointly agreed that this issue cannot be accommodated in the Staff Regulations. This is the fact that the new European diplomatic service also needs something of a separate identity. Everyone working there must be working towards the same goal and therefore, a common form of training and further training is also extremely important. That was especially important to some of my fellow negotiators, and I can understand that. I have just said that we did not succeed in doing this. It was clear that it would not be possible to incorporate something like this into the Staff Regulations systematically. However, here, once again, I have to thank the High Representative, because I have been informed that she also wants to say something about this and that she regards it as a major obligation and a major necessity and will also make another declaration of commitment in this regard, which, although not a component of the Staff Regulations, will reassure us and those who view it as particularly important as we look to the future work of the common External Action Service. Bearing all that in mind, we have done a very good job, and the service is now set for a sound start on 1 December. Bernhard Rapkay,  
rapporteur.

 Madam President, after my speech at the start of this debate, I actually only have two more comments to make. The first, which I quite deliberately left to the end of the debate, is that I would like to thank all of the shadow rapporteurs for their friendly and constructive cooperation. It is quite simply easier to negotiate when you know that your colleagues support you. For that reason, these were not the most difficult of negotiations. My second comment, however, is one that I would like to reiterate with regard to what has repeatedly been at the centre of this debate, namely, the question of geographical balance. Mrs Neynsky stole the show by saying that the compromise states nothing at all about this. I would simply suggest that, once we have adopted this, she quietly and calmly reads the text. Read the text! Reading the text will enlighten the mind. Then you will see that the compromise most definitely does contain statements – and indeed very strict, legally binding statements – on this matter. Then all of your concerns should, in fact, be dispelled. Matthias Groote and Bernhard Rapkay  (S&amp;D

 The German Social Democratic (SPD) delegation in the European Parliament is in favour of combating international terrorism and providing permanent protection for personal data with the highest possible degree of determination and effectiveness. In view of the importance of data protection, the SPD delegation did not make its decision lightly. After long and careful consideration, however, we are now able to vote in favour of the agreement: the Social Democrats have succeeded in providing for the establishment of permanent European monitoring in connection with the extraction of the data directly on the ground in the US Treasury Department – including the facility to stop the extraction of data. For us, the top priority was limiting the transfer of bulk data. SEPA data are not covered by the agreement; most transfers are not affected at all. The five-year data retention period is intended to be reviewed annually, whereby any data that is not needed is to be deleted sooner than this. In addition, an annual review of compliance with all data protection standards, with the involvement of data protection supervisors, is provided for. Even though we would have preferred the monitoring role and the transfer of data to be given to a judicial authority, Europol must carry out its mandate for approving the data transfer, provided for in the agreement, under the strict scrutiny of the EU. Although Europol has a reliable data protection system, it needs to be brought into line with the Treaty of Lisbon so that it can perform its duties under full democratic scrutiny.

 As the Committee on Legal Affairs’ rapporteur for the European External Action Service, I would like to point out that, including as a result of its amendments to Article 6 of the High Representative’s proposal, the report that has been agreed on today has absolutely no binding effect for me as rapporteur or for the European Parliament as a whole in the discussions on the adaptation of the Staff Regulations. This includes, in particular, the footnotes that were adopted in the text today. A report on a legislative proposal on which the European Parliament was only consulted cannot have any binding effect for the areas in which the European Parliament, by virtue of a different legal basis, has the power of codecision. Birgit Sippel  (S&amp;D

Mr President, almost everything has been said that needs to be said, so I will keep it brief. Why data retention? After all, food stocks have to be replaced sooner or later. That means consuming or using the food and buying a new lot. At the beginning, the debate about data retention focused on its use in anti-terrorism. In practice, however, these data are available, so apparently they have to be used, and they are accessed to investigate a very wide range of crimes, including minor or moderately serious offences. Moreover, in the process, there is a growing data hunger that is driving the storage of types of data that were not originally envisaged. The volume of data is growing. At the very least, then, we must reduce the amount of data stored, the types of use, and the duration of storage. We must protect data from abusive forms of access and use. We should be open to discussing alternatives to the current practice, and we must be mindful of one principle above all: that the rule of law and the protection of civil rights are key pillars of governance in our countries and the EU. They must be respected and defended, if necessary by abolishing the Directive. Birgit Sippel  (S&amp;D

Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, naturally it is possible to revise constitutions, media laws, Schengen rules and many other things. However there are rules. If the suspicion exists that existing laws and the values of the European Union are being violated, then this is something that must be pursued, whether in Hungary and Romania, or in France or Denmark, or any other country that could give cause for concern. I wonder, however, not just in view of the present debate, whether all those involved are really concerned with an objective clarification of events, or whether they are not more interested in party political mud-slinging or scoring party political points through sound-bites. This will not help us win back the confidence of our citizens. We need to arrange for an objective investigation to be carried out, using the same yardstick for all Member States, rather than different standards depending on whether we are located in the north, south, east or west of the European Union. If we consider the issue at the heart of these matters rather than relying on rumours and newspaper reports, then this discussion will have added value for the people of Hungary, Romania, France and Germany, and everyone else. Birgit Sippel  (S&amp;D

Mr President, let me state quite plainly from the start that freedom of movement within the EU is not a national right and thus cannot be restricted solely on a national basis. As the only elected European institution, the European Parliament must be fully consulted and given a say on all questions, whether relating to changes in the Schengen area or violations of Schengen rules. The reference to serious deficiencies at our external borders is dubious and factually incorrect. That is because the issue at stake is not just border controls, but also the excessive demands on some states immediately to investigate the legal status of every single refugee, thereby establishing clear perspectives for them. As Europeans, we must meet these challenges together, rather than sowing the seeds of uncertainty among our citizens with a crassly populist approach. This joint approach would be effective for our countries and our citizens, as well as for the refugees themselves. We should not regress to a parochial standpoint, because the fact is we need more Europe, not less. Birgit Sippel  (S&amp;D

Mr President, a number of years ago, terrorist attacks were given as the reason for introducing measures such as the retention of data or PNR. Obviously, terrorism alone is no longer enough to justify this gathering of data to our citizens, however. That is why we are currently talking about serious and organised crime and debating human trafficking; however the fact is that despite the millions of data records already on file, there have only been a few isolated successes so far. Ms Malmström argues that data protection has been improved, referring in particular to the fact that some data will be retained for ‘only’ 10 years. Data protection begins at an earlier stage, however, for example when a specific limitation of purpose is applied or when restricting the data that needs to be collected. What is it that the agreement that is to be voted on today allows? The retention of millions of data records relating mostly to completely innocent citizens, that will be checked and rechecked with different criteria for almost every conceivable purpose for the next 10 years. Other criminal activities are punishable with a custodial sentence of three years. The German Government has this to say on its website: Those travelling to the US should consider that some offences that do not even warrant a judicial process in Germany are punishable with custodial sentences of several years in the US. Penalties must apply across borders. According to the wording, it is sufficient for the suspect to intend to cross the border. This is something we all want to do when we travel to the US, as we already have the ticket for our return flight in our pockets. Furthermore, any court can demand this information. Will we have better data protection? In view of the broad range of applications, the possibility of data being forwarded to other authorities and to third countries is more than questionable. It is also regrettable that there is at present no provision for the participation of data protection specialists in the planned evaluation. At this point I do not wish to go into the fact that, in the US, terrorist suspects frequently remain in prison for several years awaiting official charges. A number of these people are innocent. We need to combat terrorism. However, this formulation clearly goes too far. Every citizen comes under suspicion and is delivered up to the US legal system, instead of protecting our values and the rights of our people. I have one final comment: Mr Albrecht asked whether those who vote in favour of the agreement should feel ashamed. No, no one should be ashamed about the way they vote today. Nonetheless, I am extremely concerned at the direction we would take by adopting this agreement and for this reason I am absolutely against it. Birgit Sippel  (S&amp;D

 Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, in the light of the history of the Hungarian people, it is particularly tragic that their own government is now withholding important rights from the citizens of Hungary. I would like to say to some speakers that even if a party was really elected by two-thirds of the people entitled to vote, it still has a specific responsibility in a democratic system to ensure that the political minority can present its views in the media and that the political minority is personally represented in the media, in the judiciary and in other areas. This is a principle which lies at the heart of democratic systems and it is a tragedy that this is not happening. The fact that we have to hold this debate today, and it is a good thing that we are doing so, is not just a result of the way in which the Hungarian Government is acting. It is also because the Council was not able in the past in the case of Hungary and in other situations to take up a clear position and to put the European values centre stage. It is also the fault of the European Commission, which has so far failed in its role as guardian of the Treaties. In the case of the independence of the judiciary, it is not about checking whether the change in the upper age limit for judges is in line with the anti-discrimination directive, instead we need to evaluate the entire package. Is the assumption justified that in future only members of a certain party will be represented in certain areas? I believe that, in the current difficult situation and in order to overcome the major challenges which face us, we need all the Member States and all the citizens of the European Union. For this reason, we must focus on values and not on individual laws. Birgit Sippel,  (S&amp;D

Madam President, I would like to propose a minor addition on behalf of my group in order to ensure that the rights of children and mothers are respected after sentencing. We would like to make an insertion after paragraph 4. I will read our proposal in English:  Reaffirms the importance of granting specific protection to mother detainees and to their children including through the use of alternative measures to detention in the child’s best interest, and calls on Member States and the Commission to actively promote and support such initiatives’.

 Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, why is it even necessary, in this House, in this European Union, to discuss detention conditions? The increasing mobility of our citizens and, in particular, the increased cooperation between the police force and the judicial system, as well as joint measures such as the European arrest warrant, require confidence. This is the confidence that everywhere in the EU, the Charter of Fundamental Rights and the Convention on Human Rights are being observed. It is confidence in properly functioning legal systems based on the principle of the presumption of innocence, in which a punishment is a punishment, not revenge or humiliation. However, many reports in the last few years and also many judgments of the European Court of Human Rights make it clear that we are still a long way from achieving this. The poor conditions relate to overcrowded prisons, a lack of opportunities for contact, a lack of medical care and many other issues besides. We urgently need common minimum standards for detention conditions and also for pre-trial detention. Long pre-trial detention periods, particularly if it is not in the person’s own Member State, can result in the loss of social contacts and jobs and, due to language barriers, they can entail isolation during detention. Therefore, in particular with regard to minor offences, alternatives to all forms of detention must be given greater consideration. The Commission’s Green Paper cites a number of examples in this regard. However, these need to be applied a great deal more in practice. The conclusion, then, is that minimum standards for detention conditions, a greater use of alternatives and special forms of accommodation for pregnant women and children are essential steps for us to take. The European Parliament has already called for changes to detention conditions in the past. Now, we must finally take specific measures. That is what we are calling for most strongly today and tomorrow. Birgit Sippel

 Mr President, Commissioner Reding, ladies and gentlemen, in the current times it is more important than ever to keep repeating that the European Union is more than just a market. It is a community of values, and it is precisely in difficult times that it must prove itself to be a strong community of values in all policy areas. The EU and its Member States are based on the common principles of freedom, democracy and the rule of law. An indispensable element of the rule of law in the context of criminal proceedings is the presumption of innocence, supported by clear and comprehensive procedural rights for the accused persons. Following the directive on the right to interpretation and to translation, the new directive on the right to information in criminal proceedings is a further important cornerstone in ensuring that suspected and accused persons are given a fair trial across the EU. The development of equal standards for procedural rights in criminal matters will strengthen our citizens’ trust in the judicial systems of the Member States. The mutual recognition of court decisions will also encourage this. An individual can only comprehensively exercise his procedural rights if he knows what those rights are. For a fair trial, it is crucial that people are aware of their rights and that they know what the accusation against them is. If authorities fail to observe these procedural rights, then they jeopardise the fairness of the proceedings and risk miscarriages of justice. The existing EU legal framework in the judicial area focuses on improved cooperation between judicial authorities. In contrast, the new directive concentrates on our citizens and the rights they enjoy in criminal proceedings. It states that police officers and prosecutors must provide people who have been arrested with written information concerning their rights in simple terms in a language they can understand. In addition to the right to interpretation and translation, this includes in particular informing them of the accusation against them, of the right to legal assistance and of the right to be heard by a judge without delay following arrest. In addition, Parliament has been able to expand the specific rights of which the suspect is to be informed. We have succeeded in integrating into the directive the right of access to medical assistance, the right to communication with relatives and the right to remain silent. No one knows in advance how long a suspected person will remain in pre-trial detention, for how long he will be deprived of his liberty. It is therefore important that he is informed of his rights at an early stage and is also given access to material evidence for and against him. The accused person must not become the object of the criminal proceedings, but rather must be able to play an active part in the proceedings. The Member States must now adopt and implement the directive as soon as possible. Finally, I would like to offer my thanks to the services of Parliament and of the Commission – and I would particularly like to thank the shadow rapporteurs, whose perseverance and really outstanding cooperation have made this report possible. It is now important that the Council and Commission bring the follow-up measures to this directive to a rapid conclusion jointly with the European Parliament, thereby creating uniform standards and fair trials throughout the EU. Birgit Sippel 
, rapporteur.
 – (DE)
 Mr President, I believe Ms Reding has said it already; today’s debate has underlined once again what the unanimous decision in the Committee on Civil Liberties, Justice and Home Affairs made clear – namely that strengthening procedural rights is a concern of us all, whatever group we belong to and, to a certain extent, whichever Member State we represent. I therefore hope – and I am very confident about this – that we will again get a good proposal from the Commission for the next measure, which is the right to a lawyer; that we will be able to improve on this even further and that, following our discussions with the Council, we will once again be able to achieve a very good directive. I wish the rapporteur, Ms Antonescu, all the best with this and I believe she can count on the support of this House. Birgit Sippel  (S&amp;D

Madam President, the directive on combating the sexual abuse, sexual exploitation of children and child pornography sends out a clear message. This subject is an important one and one that concerns the whole of Europe, and uniform rules for the definition of offences and also for the penalties apply universally. Common arrangements for the prosecution of crimes committed outside the EU are still needed. The same applies to common standards for calling legal persons to account. The directive gives specific penalty options in this regard. One key area, however, was offences committed on the Internet. Here ‘grooming’ is now made punishable. It is also important that all Member States are obliged to take measures to get websites containing child pornography deleted. However, in addition to this there remains an important requirement for all institutions of the European Union, in their international cooperation with other states, to ensure that the principle of deletion should take precedence in other countries of the world, too. A great deal of abuse takes place in real life in our children’s immediate environment. Therefore, prevention mechanisms are particularly important, as is instruction in the use of media, so that, when using new media, our children and young people are able to recognise the sources of danger. Protection measures are obviously particularly important from the point of view of those affected, both for children during criminal proceedings and also in the form of special support for children and their families outside the context of such proceedings. The Member States have a particular duty here. Overall, after difficult negotiations, we have obtained a good directive. Following its adoption, it will be up to the Member States to implement it and put it into practice as quickly and as comprehensively as possible. To finish I would like to make one more personal comment. Even though a different decision has now been taken, I would have liked there to be correlation tables for all directives in future. The fact that we will not now have this quick overview of the implementation of measures is something that I personally find very disappointing. Birgit Sippel,  
on behalf of the S&amp;D Group

 Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, PNR data is nothing new – after all this information has been gathered since commercial aviation was in its infancy. Likewise, the use of this data, for example for border control purposes, is nothing new. Nonetheless, a problem arises here which is also familiar in other areas: in an increasingly mobile world with modern information technology, data is available in quite different dimensions than was the case 50 or even 30 years ago. This is also the reason why data protection is becoming increasingly important. We have achieved a great deal with this agreement: a clear definition of potential uses, good data protection standards and clear rules for legal certainty and judicial remedy. The changeover from the pull system to the push system is also important. Data is not simply collected, but is sent to Australia. We have not been able to achieve all our demands, however. One of the major points at issue from our perspective is the five-and-a-half-year retention period. We would have liked to see a much shorter period. So, what can we do about it? Do we vote in favour of the agreement or do we reject it? I would like to make two comments. We will never achieve one hundred per cent of our demands. So, we need to weigh things up. Data would continue to be transferred even if we rejected the agreement, however then we would have no clear rules on how this data should be handled. That is why I hope that this agreement will receive majority support tomorrow, despite many reservations. In relation to the forthcoming agreement with the US, I would like to state clearly: we want an agreement here too, but a 15-year retention period is a much longer time. I genuinely fail to see why we cannot change over completely to the push system here. We need to make improvements in this area. We want uniform standards for all agreements in relation to PNR data, rather than a patchwork of arrangements in which the rights of our citizens are dealt with in different ways. Birgit Sippel  (S&amp;D

Madam President, the new mandate for Frontex is a contribution to bringing about the situation whereby, whilst our borders are given the necessary protection, human rights are observed and those seeking protection actually receive it. There are many areas where I would have liked to have seen something better, for example, when it comes to independent observers. Yet whatever you may think of this new mandate, the situation will remain a patchwork. In all the criticism of Frontex – including the justified criticism – one point is often overlooked, and that is the participation and responsibility of the Member States in their collaboration with the agency. Unfortunately, they are not something that we can reform! It would be an important further step though, if we could finally, for example, put in place a uniform and improved European asylum system. The new Frontex mandate may be a step in the right direction, but critical follow-up continues to be absolutely necessary. The discussion about protecting our borders and about the rights of refugees will not be concluded simply as a result of this new mandate. Birgit Sippel

 Madam President, I must admit to the House that I am a little confused where the debate on passenger name records (PNR) is concerned, because the facts and the issues that need to be clarified are not new. Nonetheless, one gets the impression that we are not making any progress – worse still, that we are moving back to worse conditions than those previously agreed. The signing of the agreement with Australia is currently also stalled because the Member States have asked for more time to review it. I fear that the reality is somewhat different, but I would like to hope that this has something to do with the fact that the Member States, too, have realised that not every means is justified in the fight against terror. As most of us here will remember, negotiations on the SWIFT Agreement were very difficult, but were eventually brought to a successful conclusion. I am astonished that we are now moving at a different level as regards data protection and data security, and I get the impression that we are back to standards below those that we have agreed previously. A retention period of 15 years is far too long. In the case of the 11 September 2001 attack that was so incisive for the US, for example, 15-year-old data would have been no help whatsoever because the perpetrators were much too young for data that was so old to have had any relevance. In my view, there is a very close link between proportionality and the use of data for a particular purpose. You cannot collect millions of data records from innocent citizens for 15 years and then say: ‘Actually, we are going to use this data for everything’, as is currently stated in the text of the US agreement. That is not acceptable. I would like to make it quite clear that this requirement applies not just to the US, but also to the Commission and to our Member States. If you adopt a measure to fight terrorism and serious international crime, then this measure must be limited to precisely that and cannot be expanded to allow other areas to be included by the back door.

 Madam President, in the debate on the Hungarian constitution, we heard more than once the criticism that it was a political debate. I am completely taken aback by that, because having political debates is one of the things that Parliament is expressly there to do; and I therefore want to start this topic by setting out the political framework too. Crime, and organised crime in particular, has never been held back by borders or border controls. It therefore makes no sense to rebuild borders in Europe and to restrict the way our populations are growing together. On the contrary: what we need is the consistent further development of cooperation between our Member States and cross-border cooperation by the police and justice authorities. In this area, the European Arrest Warrant has repeatedly proven itself to be an important and successful instrument. At the same time, however, this instrument will fall into disrepute if European Arrest Warrants are used for, say, stolen bicycles, or merely in order to carry out questioning. I regret to say that we have also found that it is being used when perhaps it has been decided not to execute an arrest warrant because there is evidence to show that it was unjustly issued and this is then not respected by the issuing Member State – resulting in the unfortunate situation in which the citizens concerned are repeatedly arrested whenever they cross a border. That does nothing to help build confidence in European legal systems. Why is this happening? Does the text of the directive leave too much leeway? Is it a matter of incorrect implementation in the Member States or inadequate information? We need to clarify these points, the Member States need to make improvements where necessary, and the Commission must take action to prevent such misuse. That is the only way to prevent a successful instrument being permanently damaged and confidence in these measures being lost. Moreover, all these experiences show how important it is that we finally make some progress on the road map for procedural rights. In the interests of legal certainty for everyone involved, we need to have the same rights across Europe for those accused of offences and there must be mandatory information on these rights. I call on the Commission to exert pressure to counter possible opposition on all these points; I am sure it can count on the support of Parliament in this.

 I am not sure whether I should answer your question, as it is more of a polemic comment. However, the figures show that the European Arrest Warrant is an appropriate instrument for fighting crime in the unified space of Europe. Crime is not national; crime is international and crosses borders. That is why we need to cooperate across borders. We need to deal with the teething problems of the European Arrest Warrant and stop it being misused. As an instrument, however, it is indispensable. Birgit Sippel,  
on behalf of the S&amp;D Group.

Madam President, in a globalised world, terrorism and crime are, unfortunately, also globally organised, and therefore we know that we need to cooperate internationally and need to exchange data. I am very pleased to hear that both the Commission and the Council consider that citizens’ rights and data protection are both matters to be accorded very high priority. However, that does not mean that Parliament can rest on its laurels, since issues such as retention periods, data volumes and purpose limitation, as well as controls and whether protective clauses can really be implemented in the area of data protection, will remain critical points. In this sensitive area, what we need is not blind checks, but more trust. The terms on which data is exchanged must therefore also be set at a particularly high level, since it is not just a matter of specific agreements with Australia and the US; a number of other countries such as Korea and India also already want to have PNR agreements with us. For this reason, too, it is very important that we build in particularly high security standards at this point. The same applies to the forwarding of data to third countries. Here again, we must examine very carefully the terms that we want to incorporate. At the same time, when discussing PNR data, we also need to look beyond this. What is the point of keeping the volume of data as low as possible when negotiating on PNR if the US, as a countermove, announces that it wishes not only to levy an entry fee, but also to collect additional data from passengers? We also have a problem within the European Union. What is the point of agreeing the highest possible standards and attempting to limit data volumes if, at the same time, bilateral agreements are being concluded without us having any knowledge of their content and security standards? Mrs Malmström has said that this is not about PNR data, but rather that all data that is collected should apparently serve the purpose of fighting terrorism and combating crime. I would therefore like to end by making one more request: what we need is not just good provisions on the individual measures, but also at last to take an overall view of all the measures, all the data that is transferred by the EU and the Member States. We need to be quite clear about this: we will never achieve one hundred percent security, however many measures we take and however much data we collect. That is a fact that we have to face up to. Birgit Sippel

 Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, the Treaty of Lisbon has been mentioned many times today. I should like to say something positive about it for once. Most of our citizens think it is a good thing that we can travel in Europe without borders, that we can move freely about Europe for the purposes of education, work and leisure. However, in so doing, we naturally leave a data trail behind us. For a long time now, our data has not just been stored in one Member State, but is spread throughout the European Union. That is precisely why it is a good thing that we have greater powers at European level in this area – which concerns the protection of data relating to European citizens – because our citizens quite rightly expect their data to be well protected everywhere in Europe and they do not expect large amounts of data to be passed on unnecessarily, possibly even to third countries. How are we, as the European Union – and I will make myself absolutely clear: as the European Parliament and Council; in other words, together with the Member States – supposed to ensure this protection if it is the case that while we, as the European Union, are negotiating with third countries on the forwarding of data – over what data is actually required, the purpose for which it is to be used and the safeguards that are necessary in order to protect this data – at the same time, individual Member States are negotiating with third countries on data? Especially since we do not even know what data they are talking about, what security standards are being maintained, whether duplicate data is possibly being forwarded, or even whether data is being forwarded that we would not allow to be forwarded at European level. There is also another aspect that the Member States are perhaps not taking into sufficient consideration. If a Member State negotiates with a third country, how then can I ensure – how can and will the individual Member State ensure – that only the data of its own citizens is, in fact, forwarded, if any data is forwarded at all? We now have databases within the European Union that collect data on all kinds of citizens at a central point and to which many authorities in European countries have access. In other words, if my data is stored somewhere in country A and country A decides to forward data, will my data also be forwarded to a third country? This cannot be the added value in the European Union that was intended when, for good reason, we negotiated the Treaty of Lisbon. The Member States, too, need to take note of the new balance of power between the institutions, must act accordingly, and must stick to the rules, which state that data protection is a European matter. We need to ensure at European level that as little data as possible is forwarded and only for narrowly defined purposes, and that this is not all undermined by bilateral initiatives.

Madam President, in his introduction, the rapporteur said that Parliament now has to support the agreement. Perhaps that was a mistranslation, but I will nevertheless make it very clear that I do not have to support this agreement and I most definitely will not support it. This first agreement following the entry into force of the Treaty of Lisbon will, in particular, send out a particularly important signal. However, what sort of signal are we sending out to the EU and beyond? Looking at the supporters of the agreement I can, above all, see a biblical principle at work: we wash our hands in innocence – after all, we have a treaty. However, we have absolutely no idea what happens to the people in these countries when we send them back. I would have liked to have seen a greater sensitivity to the issue of the treatment of refugees and of respect for human rights. The adoption of this agreement will severely jeopardise our credibility in matters of democracy and human rights. I would therefore ask all my fellow Members once again not to support this agreement. Birgit Sippel  (S&amp;D

 Mr President, a preliminary remark. To accept or to reject, either decision is worthy of respect. What is not acceptable, however, are certain exaggerations, half-truths and falsehoods, frequently devoid of any knowledge of the facts, which have also been voiced in the published debate. More objectivity and less emotion would surely have been fitting. To come to the point, fighting terrorism is just as much about the defence of democratic values and freedoms. One of these also requires the use of data, while the other requires a high degree of data protection. It is precisely here that, under pressure from the European Parliament, we were able to achieve a great deal: verification that a request is actually founded on a legitimate suspicion of terrorism, and daily checks by EU officials in the US Treasury Department that only data pertaining to suspected terrorists are being examined, including the possibility of stopping the extraction of data. We in Parliament are convinced that this important function must be regulated in agreement with all institutions. Compliance with standards, with the involvement of the Data Protection Officers, must be reviewed annually, and, for a storage period of five years, an annual audit to ensure that data which is not required is deleted in good time. To reiterate, intra-European transfers are not affected. Nonetheless, not everything was achieved. For example, Europol. I should like to ask the European Commission not to wait until 2013, but to prepare draft legislation quickly which ensures parliamentary control by means of codecision. Birgit Sippel,  
on behalf of the S&amp;D Group.

Mr President, I would like to contradict those who have spoken so far on one point: I am not interested in arriving at an agreement as soon as possible, but in achieving one that is as good as possible. Quality must come before timeframe. I would like to make one other preliminary remark. The European Parliament has already rejected an agreement once and one aspect among the many reasons relating to content was the lack of European Parliament participation. In view of current events this week, we have decided not to adopt any decisions here in Parliament. Then there is the decision to call on the Council to likewise postpone its decisions until we can adopt our decisions. I am now rather surprised that there are Members of the House, who clearly do not take their own decisions seriously but think: well yes, despite this, the Council can simply decide. I do not think we can treat our own decisions like that. I still maintain that the Council should also withhold its decision until after 6 May when we have decided. I am sure there are no disadvantages to this and that the United States would be understanding. As for the draft mandate itself, I take a favourable view of the fact that the Commission is committed to meeting our demands. Nevertheless, I would like to say clearly that there still need to be substantial amendments to this negotiating mandate. These are necessary if a majority of the European Parliament is to vote in favour of a new agreement. In my opinion, the current mandate is not ambitious enough to achieve this. The problem of bulk data transfer remains unresolved. If the US authorities tell us that every month we are talking about the specific details of five to ten people, then the transfer of millions of pieces of data relating to European citizens is surely disproportionate to this purpose. Incidentally, I would like to say again to the Commission and the Council that although it is constantly maintained that this agreement will be highly significant as an additional means of combating terrorism, the proof of this is not as clear as we are always being told. The long period of retention of data in the United States also continues to be a problem. The mandate does not offer a solution here either. We need a judicial authority on European soil that not only checks the legality of US applications, but also the extraction of data, wherever this takes place. The transmission of information to third countries must be regulated with clear directives. We need an ambitious mandate with our demands. Only then can we achieve a really good result that meets our demands, taking into account data protection as well as the fight against terror. Finally, I have another specific question for the Council and the Commission. How do you intend to ensure that only data that was specifically requested is extracted and passed on? How can that work? In the United States? Or are there other proposals? Birgit Sippel,  
on behalf of the S&amp;D Group.

Madam President, there are a few basic things I would like to say about this agreement. There are, by all means, similarities with SWIFT, but also differences. If the European Parliament had to vote today on the Passenger Name Record (PNR) agreement, we would have no other option but to vote no. That is quite clear. There are still significant objections to this agreement. I will go into the details once more shortly. That is why I was not happy when we spoke about postponing the vote. However, unlike SWIFT, there were definitely good reasons for this postponement. Nevertheless, I will say quite clearly that, for us, it does not mean that the vote can be postponed indefinitely, so that we now have a provisional agreement for years on end. It is very important to us that we quickly reach a new negotiating mandate and, if possible, before the summer break, so that we can quickly gain clarity in detailed questions on how we should handle this data and what data should be included. Data protection plays an important role and here, I would like to use the opportunity to address once again the question as to what data should be transmitted. PNR covers 19 individual pieces of data. I know from conversations I have had that it is of course possible – if you want to – to create personality profiles from these pieces of data. Now, of course, those with whom we have such an agreement are saying they have no interest in this, they will not do it and that relevant data is erased. However, if certain data that could be used to create a personality profile is not used at all, then we must consider whether it should indeed be collected, or – if we reach an agreement – whether all of the data needs to be transmitted. That is a crucial question. We also have to check what level of protection is afforded to data that is transmitted. We know that the regulations in both agreements with the USA and Australia are very different. With a view to further requests by other countries that want to have similar agreements, we should ensure that every time we reach an agreement, special standards apply. We also have to consider in detail the question of how this data is to be used. Originally, it was always said that it was about combating terrorism. Now however, it is also about serious crime. This can be discussed. However, we must go into great detail here. We know that even within the European Union itself, legal systems and legal culture vary greatly. This may mean that the definition of what constitutes a serious crime is completely different in terms of the type of crime. That means we need to look again in detail at what we are discussing when we say that serious crime should also naturally be included. I hope that in future, with the implementation of the agreement, we ensure that there is a regular exchange of information between the institutions. The President-in-Office of the Council has indicated that there has been a first review as far as the agreement with the USA is concerned. Officially, we still do not have these results yet. That was in February. In future, I would not only like to see reports being drawn up regularly, I would also like to see these reports actually being made available to the European Parliament immediately. It is very important to create a uniform agreement. The issue of data must be reviewed again. However, I believe that, on the basis of the previous discussion, we will probably reach a good agreement, and I therefore view further negotiations as something entirely positive. Birgit Sippel  (S&amp;D

 Mr President, anyone who has followed the many discussions about SWIFT over recent weeks might get the impression that without SWIFT, we would descend into chaos and that rejecting the agreement would bring an end to the transatlantic relationship and the joint war on terror. These attempts to threaten us can be described in one word: ridiculous. The US and the Council are not trying to rescue an essential tool; they are simply saving face. There are many agreements and measures in place to combat terrorism. SWIFT could be a useful addition to these. The failed attack on 25 December has clearly demonstrated that it is not data we are lacking, but the ability to make effective use of the data which we already have. The idea is to divert attention away from this fact. The interim agreement simply could not be worse. It is full of contradictions and inconsistencies. Instead of suitable precautions being taken to ensure that only data relating to people who are actually under suspicion is transferred, huge volumes of data will be sent to the US every month. The agreement represents a flagrant breach of citizens’ rights, data protection and the principles of the rule of law. If the Council and the US were really prepared to take on board this criticism and to incorporate these points into a new agreement, then there would be no need for us to accept this dreadful agreement. In the interests of the citizens, we must say no to the interim agreement and we must start new negotiations immediately, so that we can put in place a really good agreement which acts as an additional, effective tool for combating terrorism and which preserves our fundamental rights.

 Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, we should discuss today’s debate, and particularly the decisions which follow the discussion, not from a formal, but rather a political perspective. Uniform standards for laboratory work are, of course, also important for cooperation between the police and the judiciary that is based on trust. However, there are many aspects of this matter which time does not permit us to discuss. In principle, however, the core issue is altogether different, namely how seriously the political acteurs
 take the Treaty of Lisbon, the rights of the Parliament and the citizens, as well as the trustworthy cooperation of the Council and the Parliament. I would like to give three examples: the Treaty of Lisbon describes the High Representative as a strong voice for Europe, and it is a great shame that the Member States have clearly also applied different criteria in this case. The agreement on SWIFT codes, which is controversial in many ways, could once again be subjected to careful scrutiny by the European Parliament next Monday. Instead, it is to be quickly ticked off the list a few hours beforehand and signed with the United States. We are facing the same situation with the topics we are dealing with here. Shortly before the Treaty of Lisbon enters into force, we are being asked to quickly push through decisions, which include provisions for the future which will limit our scope for making decisions, or at least significantly restrict them. We have to ask ourselves why this is the case, as it was certainly possible to submit new proposals on other issues. The Council’s and the Commission’s stance lost them the chance to send a clear message to the people of Europe, a sign of commitment to implementing the treaty, a sign of a democratic Europe of the citizens. We, the European Parliament, have only one option: we must reject these proposals, as we want a broad public debate and we want to use our strengthened rights to support the citizens now, rather than in the near or more distant future.

 Mr President, this morning we have talked a great deal about targeted growth in the European Union. The cohesion policy is a European investment programme that we have at our disposal for creating growth. For this reason, we need at least as much money in the future budget as we have had available to date. The Friends of Cohesion are not against better spending of the money. However, I am not sure whether the friends of better spending in the Council really want good cohesion policy, which is something we need in order to overcome the crisis. There is a second point I would like to mention. In the negotiation box, which has also been mentioned frequently here, 90% of all points in the area of cohesion policy are basically decided with the European Parliament in the ordinary legislative procedure. Please would you accept that this time, for the first time, Parliament is involved in the ordinary legislative procedure for all areas of cohesion policy. The negotiations in committee will be complete in mid-July. We will then have a mandate and be able to negotiate. I hope that the Council will be prepared to do the same at that time.

 Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, it has so often been said that small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs) lie at the heart of the European Union’s economy and this is indeed the case. We are doing a great deal for them. I believe that this is something really special because, in contrast to other large economic areas, we have smaller companies which are competitive on global markets and which are flexible enough to adapt to changing conditions. That is the special feature of SMEs in the European Union and we are providing them with support. They are at the centre of our structural policy not just in the next subsidy period, but also here and now. We have done a lot to ensure that they can access the money from the Structural Funds more easily. However, I believe that there is potential for further improvement and simplification in this area. When a small company applies for a loan at favourable interest rates, it should not be necessary for the company to fill out reams of forms. I think that there is still room for improvement here. However, I also believe that by means of an intelligent initiative, we can encourage SMEs to create closer links between economic growth, an innovative approach to economic development and the struggle to reduce youth unemployment levels. Mr Hahn said in a previous debate that if every company in Europe were to hire just one young person, the problem of youth unemployment would effectively go away. He is right to a certain extent. I am not trying to say that we should insist that money from the European Union will only be made available when companies take on one or two young people. That sort of approach reminds me of my past in the German Democratic Republic, which was also unable to resolve this sort of problem. However, I think it is worth considering how we can establish an intelligent project that could be subsidised by the European Union and would give young people real opportunities for training followed by jobs within companies. Perhaps we will be able to make progress in this area in time for the next subsidy period. However, I must make it clear that I do not want to see merely windfall effects for companies. There must be lasting growth and a lasting reduction in unemployment. I do have one request for the Commission. I know that the Commission is currently reviewing competition law. It would be very helpful in this respect if we could ensure that regions are not pulled apart and that the subsidy conditions in one region are not completely different from those in another. This would lead to more bureaucracy and make access to subsidy funding much more difficult. I hope that the Commission can come up with a positive proposal in this area which will not result in the regions being torn apart. Constanze Angela Krehl  (S&amp;D
),

Targeted investment in business, infrastructure and renewable energies will be required in Greece in order to get the country back on its feet. This is precisely the purpose of the funds provided for under European cohesion policy. In order to implement our projects, however, we need money from private investors. These are unable to raise the necessary loans at present, however, because the banks mostly view any investment in Greece as too risky. That is why I believe we should use part of the funds already allocated to Greece to secure such loans. The banks can rest assured that they will get their money back, while investors will get their much-needed loans and can therefore participate in EU projects, enabling Greece to create several thousand jobs. The advantage of the report is also that it enables very efficient use of the precious funding that is available: by simply using these resources to secure the risk, we can generate more investment than if the money were to be invested directly in projects. Finally, this report makes one thing clear: the European Union is right behind Greece and private investors can rely on this fact. Constanze Angela Krehl,

Madam President, Commissioner, I would like to make three brief points in response to this oral question. First of all, I very much welcome the fact that the Commission wants to put tackling youth unemployment at the heart of its policy. Giving hope and a future to young people is part of our remit and it is very important to us. Secondly, I also welcome the fact that the Commission is increasingly realising that, in a time of economic crisis more than ever, cuts are not the only route to success: we also need investment. In that respect, SMEs should, of course, be our topmost priority, because they create the most jobs and are very important for economic development. Thirdly, let me be very clear and open about this: it appears, from what is being said in the media, that Mr Barroso has been giving the impression that he is able to stump up EUR 82 billion for this European Union, with the throwaway comment afterwards that that money will no longer be spent as planned in the cohesion policy, anyway; we will, instead, be able to use that money right away to do precisely what we have just been talking about: namely, tackling youth unemployment and supporting SMEs. EUR 82 billion – that is almost a quarter of the total cohesion policy budget up to 2013. As far as I am aware, that money is already tied up in programmes and projects. How exactly do you intend to go about this: that is, allowing all the regions, all of a sudden, to start doing something completely different with that money and, then, because the youth unemployment figures are not so high in your neck of the woods, making some of that money available to other countries? The regions have responded to this with dismay. I have received a lot of calls from people asking me: what is going on? Is the money being taken away from us? What is the point of that? Let me give you a word of warning. The cohesion policy has really been a tremendously successful policy and one that has been extremely tangible and comprehensible to citizens. It creates trust. If we now start making vague statements like this, which create the impression that we have money left over, that our policy so far has not been adequate, or that we can rustle up a couple of billion just like that, that will not create any additional trust, but only uncertainty. Most importantly, when I consider the fact that the Council has failed to provide the full amount of funds considered necessary by the Commission and Parliament for this year’s budget negotiations and the fact that, according to the information I have received, some EUR 15 billion are needed this year for projects that have already been completed, but we only have EUR 5 billion, at the very most, at our disposal, then I really wonder how anyone can go around implying that Member States are prepared to fork out more money and allocate additional funds for the cohesion policy. I think that we need to be careful that we actually pursue the right policy and that we offer support to countries with high youth unemployment. However, I would also like us to ensure that we do not create even more uncertainty for people in times that are difficult enough already. Constanze Angela Krehl  (S&amp;D

 Mr President, there is broad agreement both in Parliament and in the Commission on the future importance of cohesion policy for all the regions in Europe. I would like to ask Mr Hahn how the Commission intends to ensure that genuine flexibility within the regions can be guaranteed, given the differences between the regions and their different levels of growth, if everything is being controlled with great precision under the terms of the regulations and there is hardly any scope to accommodate the specific features of each region.

 Does this mean that a region which has already introduced extensive energy efficiency measures will not be forced to do so, but could instead invest in research facilities and that this could be laid down in the partnership contract? Constanze Angela Krehl,  
on behalf of the S&amp;D Group
. – (DE) 
Madam President, cohesion policy is a successful European policy which everyone makes use of, including regions which are not as well developed and those which already have a strong economy. A variety of studies have demonstrated this. However, most importantly, the citizens of Europe can experience its benefits at first hand. This is why we need cohesion policy in future in all the regions of the European Union. Nevertheless, we are under an obligation to make our good policies even better. This is what the European Parliament is aiming to achieve with Mr Pieper’s report. Modern cohesion policy means facing the new challenges, creating up-to-date infrastructure, combating climate change, supporting energy security and efficiency, promoting research and development, providing support for small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs) and creating jobs. Of course, we also need to ensure that the funding is used efficiently. Therefore, we are making it clear that cohesion policy must be more transparent and results-oriented and must involve less red tape. The coordination between the various funds and programmes must also be improved, as Mr Stavrakakis said earlier. One very important point is that the partnership principle must be taken to a new and better level. We must involve everyone, including the regions, local areas, both sides of industry and major non-governmental organisations. The new intermediate category remains controversial. We are of the opinion that the intermediate category will help regions which need more support than the classic Objective 2 regions. They will not be funded at the expense of other regions. On the contrary, the result will not be a patchwork of subsidies. Instead the many phasing-in and phasing-out procedures will be standardised and I believe that this is something which we really need in the European Union. Anyone who thinks that we are introducing a permanent subsidy category is underestimating the European Parliament. Over the past few years we have demonstrated often enough that we are able to bring in community initiatives when they are needed. However, we have also worked jointly to remove them again once the objective has been achieved. We are competent enough to be able to judge at the end of a subsidy period whether the results are good and how we should redesign the programme. Therefore, I am calling on my fellow Members to support this new intermediate category when it comes to the vote. Constanze Angela Krehl,  
rapporteur for the opinion of the Committee on Regional Development.
 – (DE)
 Mr President, cohesion policy accounts for one of the largest individual budgets in the European Union. We need to develop a new policy that is adapted to the new challenges. We want investment in a modern infrastructure, in research, innovation and the development of new technologies. We want sustainable, integrated urban development and we want a well-educated workforce. The regions need specific subsidies to help them to become competitive and to develop economically. However, at the same time, it must be said that all regions must have access to cohesion policy, both Eastern European Member States and strong national economies like Germany. Eastern Germany requires support. However, some western German regions require European aid, as do parts of the United Kingdom. This requires a budget that should be no smaller than the current one and that cannot be split into different sectors. We must make every effort to improve efficiency and transparency and we must link this with an abandonment of unnecessary bureaucracy. Cohesion is linked with solidarity. However, cohesion is also sensible from an economic point of view and necessary. A lack of cohesion is bad news, even for strong national economies. For this reason, we should provide appropriate financial backing for cohesion policy. I would like to thank the rapporteur for including the opinion of the Committee on Regional Development in his report and I would ask for support for the amendment for once again improving the intermediate categories. We have reached a compromise in the Committee on Regional Development and I would recommend that this House should incorporate the compromise found by the specialist politicians in the Garriga Report. I would ask for your broad support. Constanze Angela Krehl,  
on behalf of the S&amp;D Group.

 Mr President, Commissioners, ladies and gentlemen, in the European Union, cohesion policy means that we aim to lend our support to the weaker regions. It is an expression of major European solidarity. Solidarity, however, is never a one-way street, and my group therefore backs the principle that all the regions of the European Union must be able to participate in our cohesion policy. For us, this also means that we will not support any measures of renationalisation and that we do not want to see cohesion policy fragmented into sector-based policy approaches. We do not need any extra transport or climate protection or energy efficiency funds, but we do need to work on how we reconcile the challenges we face with a sound cohesion policy. It is therefore clear to us that, alongside a strong Objective 1 area, we also need a strong Objective 2 area, and appropriate transitional rules. One thing is for certain, and that is that regions need our support at the European level. The European Union needs strong regions, too, and there is therefore a give and take in both directions. Of course, we need to review our priorities – clearly, we do need greater efficiency. My group is therefore four-square behind the proposal, in order, for example, to be able to coordinate rural development much better together under the umbrella of cohesion policy than in the past. Of course, we also back improving infrastructure, supporting businesses and supporting sustainable economic development. However, sustainable economic development is only possible if we bring the employed – the people – with us. In other words, we need employment policy approaches, we need education, we need training, we need people to integrate into the labour market. That, in turn, is only possible in collaboration with the European Social Fund, under the umbrella of cohesion policy. We support this, but with dedicated rules, which there did used to be in the past. We need to really make an effort to improve this and significantly strengthen the social side of cohesion policy. In the forthcoming discussions and negotiations, my group will be going in to bat for improving and simplifying the usability of the fund. We need a simplification of the application processes so that, first of all, fewer errors are made, and, secondly, so that access for those people who really want to work can be made easier through this European cohesion policy. We will strive to ensure that, in these negotiations, a stronger partnership principle really is implemented. I believe that Parliament’s role has been strengthened now that the Treaty of Lisbon is in force. My group will be arguing the case for this partnership principle. Constanze Angela Krehl  (S&amp;D

 Mr President, the current Cohesion policy started life with the title of the Lisbon Strategy. However, I firmly believe that the Cohesion policy can, and will, make an enormous contribution to the Europe 2020 strategy, not just because we command a considerable budget in comparison with other European policies but, above all, because the Cohesion policy allows us to have sustainable development in our regions and ensures good monitoring of the restructuring processes and challenges in our regions. However, there is one core issue here that I would like to clarify once again, and that goes for our group as well: our Cohesion policy can only work if economic development is considered to be equally as important as social development and providing training for workers. In principle, we need to take joint responsibility for the funds that are available to us. It is a bit like hardware and software – one cannot work without the other. Constanze Angela Krehl,  
deputising for the rapporteur.

 Mr President, I am very sorry that Mr Kirilov cannot present the report himself. He has worked very hard to draw up a report for Parliament on a subject which is very important for the regions and the citizens of the European Union. Therefore, I would like to read out his notes. They are in English, which is very surprising for a Bulgarian Member. However, it is a good thing that I do not have to speak Bulgarian. I am very pleased that I can represent him here in Parliament, even though he was unable to get a flight in Sofia.  Mr President, I am glad that this evening we have the opportunity to discuss important amendments to the Structural Funds general regulation. These modifications are a substantial element of the common efforts at European and national level to overcome the consequences of the economic crisis. They are a logical continuation of the documents which we adopted last year. Then, as the rapporteur on the role of the cohesion policy for investment in the real economy, I called on the Council and Commission to work for simplification of the Structural Funds rules and thus facilitating access to these funds when they are more needed by the Member States. I am happy that Parliament’s main recommendations for further simplification have been taken on board. I am convinced that the new changes to the general regulations, simplifying some of the existing procedures, deserve our support. Reducing unnecessary administrative burden, red tape and unclear rules will contribute to more transparency, better control and fewer irregularities. This also means improved implementation and correct spending on EU money. Here is just one example. Through the amendment of Article 88, the Member States are further stimulated to detect and correct irregularities before they are found by the EU controlling institutions. In this case, the Member States will not lose the affected money but will be able to use them again for other projects within the relevant programme. The second group of amendments concern financial management rules. Advance payments for countries worst hit by the crisis will be increased for 2010. All Member States will receive more time to spend 2007-committed funds for projects which have not been approved or implemented within the deadlines. Both groups of measures are important because of their message to the beneficiaries and because of their practical utility. Anti-crisis measures are a clear demonstration of solidarity. They will bring fresh money for the Member States to get out of the crisis. All measures will commit realisation of more projects, especially now. This is crucial for the creation of jobs, investment and infrastructure and adaptation of workers and firms to the economic change. Both types of measures are useful and more valuable if they are implemented at the right time, but they are still awaiting final approval. Unfortunately, there was a huge delay in the Council for reaching an agreement when it was the leading body for the adoption of the amended regulation. I strongly believe that now, when Parliament has the same power as the Council, we will not postpone any more the approval and entry into force of these long-awaited and needed measures.

 Mr President, this is certainly not a nice reason for this debate. Madeira has been hit by an unbelievable natural disaster and we extend our condolences to the families affected. The European Union must provide support in this situation. The solidarity of the whole of the European Union is required here and I can only reiterate what has already been said. I urge the Commission to mobilise the Solidarity Fund as quickly as possible so that help can be provided. I would like to ask the Council to ensure that the reform of the Solidarity Fund that Parliament adopted two years ago is finally implemented, because this will make it possible to provide assistance more quickly to the regions affected. We also need to look to the future. In recent years, Madeira has received a lot of structural fund resources and will also continue to do so over the next few years. These resources need to be used to take preventative action so as to be able to reduce the terrible consequences of natural disasters and therefore also the suffering. This is something that, as the European Union, we need to implement in the regions and therefore also in Madeira. Constanze Angela Krehl,

Madam President, the Group of the Progressive Alliance of Socialists and Democrats in the European Parliament supports the initiative for the development of a strategy for the Danube Region. This is an important project to us, also because it strengthens, in an exemplary manner, territorial cohesion, which has been included for the first time in the Treaty of Lisbon, and may also provide an opportunity to make it clear exactly what we understand by territorial cohesion. I hope that Mr Rehn has also told the many partners he has spoken to that the European Parliament will be duly involved in drawing up the common strategy for the Danube Region. Unfortunately, I did not hear the words European Parliament in your speech, but we will duly take part in the debate. I am pleased that we are having the first major debate here in plenary today. In addition to territorial cohesion, it is also important to make it clear that this strategy involves cross-border cooperation, something that we are always encouraging and have always supported in the area of cohesion policy, and in fact already wanted to increase during this funding period. I hope that this will have even greater success in the next few years, including in connection with the Danube Strategy. I would like to point out that, with this Danube Strategy, we will attain European added value, which will be really tangible, particularly for the people living in this region. They should, therefore, be directly involved in drawing up the strategy and they should also be given the opportunity to witness this European project. My earnest request is that we do not overload and burden the strategy with too many priorities, but that we focus on what we want to achieve. In my opinion, it is very important that we use the existing resources more efficiently and that we build or expand warning systems, for example, and set them up appropriately to warn of natural disasters such as floods, but also to respond in the event of industrial accidents, for example, which result in the pollution of the Danube and neighbouring regions. Common areas of activity exist here. A successful Danube Strategy and successful projects in this region may also provide models for other regions. Without always having to immediately invent a new strategy, we can use this as an example for resolving problems together in cross-border European cooperation and – if we succeed in actually incorporating third countries into such a strategy – also for putting in place a Neighbourhood Policy, which is something that is important for all of us in the European Union and which should be promoted.

 Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, I would have liked to see a more exciting introduction to this topic, because I believe that the European cohesion policy must change after 2013. We are faced with quite different challenges than was the case 10 or 15 years ago. The focus for my group is on the fact that solidarity between the regions is not negotiable. On the one hand, this means that all the regions must have the opportunity to participate in the European Union cohesion policy and, on the other hand, it also means that we must oppose any attempt to renationalise the cohesion policy. We need a European approach which allows citizens to identify with the European Union. For us, there is no question that we also need to change. In the next few years, the spotlight will be on a discussion about prioritising the areas which will receive funding from the European cohesion policy. In future, we will not be able to subsidise everyone with European money. We must focus on establishing effective infrastructures, in particular, in the new Member States, and on developing research and innovation. Of course, we must also bear in mind that in future, the European cohesion policy will have to respond appropriately to challenges such as climate change, demographic change and globalisation. We also need to concentrate on urban development. This is not because I want to neglect rural areas, but because we know that 80% of citizens live in towns, cities and urban hinterlands and because rural development unfortunately does not form part of the cohesion policy at the moment, but is covered by agriculture policy. Our approach is to create stronger networks. I do not yet know whether this will work, but we must rise to the challenge. Importantly, support for people themselves also forms part of the cohesion policy and this is why I regret the fact that the Commissioner’s response was slightly evasive. For us, this means primarily education, training and qualifications for everyone from small children right through to the elderly. Life-long learning is an important concept. However, this also means that the European Social Fund (ESF) must continue to be integrated with the cohesion policy. There must be no thoughts of separating the ESF from the cohesion policy. Cross-border cooperation is very important to us. We want to strengthen this cooperation at the same time as simplifying the bureaucracy involved. Constanze Angela Krehl,

Mr President, Mrs Malmström, ladies and gentlemen, I am delighted that the Swedish Presidency has put cooperation in the Baltic Sea area at the top of its agenda. There is no need for argument here: we need to protect resources and we, too, need to help protect the climate and nature. On the other hand, we must also focus cooperation in the Baltic Sea area on economic development, of that there can be no question. You have our full support here. However, some questions do still arise. You just said that there are no additional funds. As we discussed this in committee, all the funds are to be made available under the current cohesion policy. For me, this raises the question of whether this means under existing projects that are already being financed from cohesion resources or under new projects. If so, we need to ask which cohesion policy projects already approved will lose funding. This is a very important point, because I already know that the towns, local authorities and regions will come and ask me, what should we do in order to become involved in the Baltic Sea Strategy? How do we get the funds to run this sort of project? If we do not give them a good answer and cannot indicate how this cooperation is to be organised, then citizens’ enthusiasm for Baltic Sea cooperation will probably quickly turn to frustration. That is not the objective that we are working together to achieve and we therefore need to hold very intensive talks on how to organise this cooperation. I therefore ask – and I would ask the Commissioner to take this on board – that not only the Council and the Commission participate in the Baltic Sea Strategy, but also that Parliament is properly involved in this cooperation and in the implementation of this strategy, because we would like other regions to profit as well, as with the Black Sea policy or with cooperation between the states bordering the Danube. That would be very important to us. Dagmar Roth-Behrendt,

Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, where the Council and the Member States are concerned, I often have the feeling, well, I am often reminded of a monitor lizard. Monitor lizards have forked tongues. Perhaps that is too complex a metaphor for the Member States, so let me simply say that they have a split personality. They want to impose more and more new tasks on the European Union – and to some extent we support that with our priorities – but they are not willing to equip the EU with the capacities it needs, in terms of adequate personnel, to perform these tasks. I have heard our fellow Members talking about the different policy areas, such as agriculture, as Mr De Castro has mentioned, but also cultural policy, research, environmental policy, social policy and regional development. These are tremendously important areas for all of the Member States and for the regions which we represent. What strikes me, however, is what the Member States are not doing. They are not considering who is meant to do the work on all of these policies. Who is supposed to process the applications? Who will ensure that the projects are implemented properly and funding is channelled to where it is needed? For that to happen, we need enough staff, and these staff must be properly qualified, highly skilled employees. We need the very best people we can find! We need a multicultural workforce from many different European Union countries, with more geographical balance and outstanding language skills. What does the Council want? What do the Member States want? They want to make cuts here! Unless we have an appropriate financial framework for administrative expenditure, we will not be in a position to work on any policy areas at all. With that in mind, I urge you, President-in-Office, to ensure that the Commission’s proposal on the staff regulations is accepted so that we have an appropriate framework that enables us to carry out this work!

 Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, if we had been this timid during the BSE crisis fifteen years ago, when I was the chair of a committee, we would not have safe beef on which we can now rely. Fifteen years ago, it was self-evident that we would introduce an animal passport and that two ear tags would be mandatory. Today, we are once again hesitant. Do we really need crises in order to make the right decisions? The rapporteur said that this is not about public health, but that is precisely what this is about. This is about health policy, it is about public health. I admit that the introduction of a mandatory electronic identification system does, of course, involve a certain amount of expenditure and effort. I therefore proposed in committee that we should put forward a transitional period of 10 years. Even that, however, was too much for the majority of the committee. Do you want to face your electors earnestly and tell them that you take public health seriously? Not a single farmer would say that they could not achieve this given ten years. Let us turn now to voluntary labelling. In this connection, we have repeatedly said that what we want to do is to urge farmers to connect better with consumers and provide information in which consumers are interested. How old are the animals? How have they lived? How have they been fed? How were they reared? We are providing this option with the voluntary system. It is used in every Member State. The rapporteur is now proposing that we should remove the essential characteristics that provide conditions for how the system is to be operated. That would mean that there would be a system, but no conditions within it. Who seriously believes that something like that can actually work? Not a single national authority would be able to monitor these elements. No one can manage that. In other words, the aim is to destroy an existing system. Fortunately, the majority of the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Food Safety – and the rapporteur must represent that committee here, after all – decided to retain this voluntary system as it is. I would like to ask all my fellow Members to vote in favour of the amendments tabled by that committee when we vote on this tomorrow. Ladies and gentlemen, I do believe, however, that we could consider whether we can simplify this system from an administrative point of view. Then, however, we would have to simplify the system and remove the administrative obstacles and hurdles. We need to help the authorities, but the way proposed here is the wrong way to go. Ladies and gentlemen, I ask you urgently, including in the interests of the consumers and of the farmers of the European Union, to follow the lead of the decisions of the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Food Safety when it comes to voluntary labelling.

– Madam President, yes it is true that we need more money in the European budget to have programmes to educate about HIV/AIDS and to monitor it. But I wish to ask Ms Parvanova if she agrees with me that Member States are neglecting that disease and that we have different amounts of money spent in Member States – which is a shame, as we heard from Ms Childers – and that it would be necessary to ask the Commission to ask the Member States to show us how much money they spend on education programmes, how much money they spend on treating the disease, on hospices and on helping to eradicate this disease? It would be good if we could ask the new Presidency, the Danish Presidency, to deliver those numbers as soon as possible. Dagmar Roth-Behrendt  (S&amp;D

Madam President, Commissioner, medicinal products are one of the most important things that help people to get healthy, but, at the same time, they pose an enormous risk. Do you agree with me that our approach needs to be more harmonised? Do you agree with me that the ‘notified bodies’ in the Member States do not work well? Do you agree with me that the new legislation that you are going to bring forward over the next year must therefore ensure, on behalf of patients, that there is a body that checks in a uniform and harmonised way whether a medicinal product really is safe for patients? Do you further agree with me that it is necessary, for the wellbeing of patients in the European Union, for us to clearly define the use of any given product – whether on a one-off or repeated basis – and not to leave this in the hands of the industry. President.

− I would just like to clarify that this is not an instrument to be used in order to get a chance to speak, Mr Stoyanov. That is a misuse of this instrument. You have asked to speak under the catch-the-eye procedure. You are indeed on the catch-the-eye list. You can consider whether you now want to be taken off this list and then make another request to speak. Dagmar Roth-Behrendt  (S&amp;D

 Mr President, I would have liked my fellow Members to have been slightly braver and to have gone for a second reading and then the conciliation procedure, whatever the Presidency in question. No front-of-pack labelling, no calorie information on the front, no indication at least of the calories in alcohol, never mind any other ingredients, no portion sizes at all, not a spoonful or a cup or anything else. The compromise includes none of these things. The country of origin information, which is something that consumers urgently need to know, is totally inadequate. The content of Article 25, like everything else, is linked to reports from the Commission on the status of the implementation of provisions: reports on trans fats, reports on products with one ingredient, reports on a whole range of other subjects. This really is a resounding failure. It is not a good result and it is very disheartening. I would have liked to have seen a proper second reading and then, if necessary, the conciliation procedure. That would have been a respectable result. Now European consumers will simply be disappointed. Dagmar Roth-Behrendt,  
rapporteur.

 Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I can no longer count the number of times over the past 14 or 15 years that I have spoken here in Parliament on subjects relating to bovine spongiform encephalopathy (BSE), transmissible spongiform encephalopathies (TSEs), animal health and, most importantly, consumer protection and human health. In 1997 I was the chair of the BSE committee and since then I have had the opportunity to speak perhaps 20, 30 or 40 times on the subject. We have a report here to discuss today and to vote on tomorrow, which concerns another Commission road map. At this point, I would like to thank the Commission, Mr Dalli and his colleagues once again for their cooperation. Over all the years that we have been dealing with BSE, this cooperation has been of a consistently high quality and I am grateful for this. However, this has not always been the case. If the situation in the 1980s and 1990s had been similar, we would have perhaps had fewer problems, but, thank goodness, things have changed over recent years. The road map contains essential technical sections, but it also has sections relating to the content which are important in political terms. I would like to refer to some of them, but I will not be able to cover all of them because of a lack of time. In all of the proposals which I am asking you to accept tomorrow, safeguarding the health of consumers is, of course, the highest priority. In recent years, we have introduced several amendments to the legislation on BSE and TSEs and, rightly so, when you consider that in 2001 we had 2 167 cases of animals with BSE in the European Union, while in 2009 the figure was only 67. This alone shows what a quantum leap forward has been taken in animal health and also in consumer protection. Tomorrow we will have to look at the question of whether we want to continue on this path. I have made a few proposals relating to the content which will also help us to continue reducing the risk of BSE and TSEs. However, I would like to focus here on one proposal and that is the question of the ban on feeding meat and bone meal to omnivores which are not ruminants, in other words, not sheep, goats and cattle. In 2001, in the light of the BSE crisis and the BSE scandal, a ban on feeding meat and bone meal to pigs and poultry in particular was introduced. At no point did this have any scientific basis; it was purely a political decision. At that time we had to admit that contaminated meat and bone meal had been fed to cattle. This was highly unethical because cattle are ruminants and herbivores and should not eat meat and bone meal. This contributed to the BSE crisis and, therefore, there was a complete ban on feeding meat and bone meal which also covered omnivores, in other words, animals which eat animal protein and, in particular, pigs and poultry. I would like to propose to you now, just as the Commission is doing, that we go back and say that if we can produce these products safely, then we must also be able to feed them. There is no point in us eating only about one third of an animal and not eating the rest of the animal which is fit for human consumption, but also not being allowed to reuse it to feed other animals. Therefore, we must amend this regulation. We are importing large quantities of protein crops, soya in particular, from the USA and Brazil, all of which have been genetically modified. That is not an acceptable alternative. We need our own high-quality, safe supply from within the European Union. The manufacturing method used must meet the relevant standards and we must also ensure that no cannibalism occurs. In other words, pigs must only eat meat and bone meal made from poultry and vice versa. The Commission can make sure that this is what happens. I hope that tomorrow, following the very positive cooperation, a large majority will be in favour of taking this next step towards returning the situation to normal. Dagmar Roth-Behrendt,  
rapporteur.

 Madam President, in conclusion I would like to look at one point and that is the question of the feed ban which was introduced in 2001. I understand the fact that not all of you have been as closely involved with this subject over the last 15 years as I have. However, it is important for you to know that bovine spongiform encephalopathy (BSE) came about because illegal, undeclared feed containing processed ruminant protein was wrongly fed to cattle. In other words, sheep suffering from scrapie made their way into the meat and bone meal and this infected a similar species, namely another ruminant. This report, which I am sure you have all read, and this is directed at Mrs Grossetête, Mrs Rivasi and also Mrs Werthmann, specifically does not state that it will be possible to process ruminants to produce meat and bone meal. Ruminants are specifically excluded. Only pigs and poultry will be processed to make meat and bone meal. Even if the wicked farmers whom Mrs Rivasi mentioned actually exist and even if these nasty farmers do something illegal, in other words, feeding pig meat and bone meal to cattle, nothing would happen to the cattle. Therefore, and you can really believe me, because I will not do anything in relation to BSE and transmissible spongiform encephalopathies (TSEs) without thinking about it in great detail, I am calling on you once again to consider this carefully. Mr Häusling, Mrs Rivasi’s fellow Member, drafted an excellent report on the protein deficit in the European Union. We must not throw away other parts of animals that we eat because we cannot or do not want to process these parts which are fit for human consumption. This is what we did until 2001. The correct reaction at that time would have been to continue using meat and bone meal, but not to process cattle and sheep to produce it. That would have been the sensible solution. However, we rather overshot the mark and took our populist approach a little too far. Now it is time to correct this mistake. In the meantime, 10 years have passed and it is clear that meat and bone meal is a valuable source of protein, just as valuable as soya from Brazil and the USA and perhaps a better solution than creating monocultures in those countries and importing genetically modified plants into the European Union. I am calling on Parliament to take a unified stand tomorrow. I would ask you all to support my proposal. Dagmar Roth-Behrendt  (S&amp;D
).

 Mr President, Mr Dalli, your colleagues in the Directorate-General for Health and Consumers and yourself have done everything right. The same cannot be said of the German authorities. The least that we can say is that there is chaos when it comes to communications, and that, perhaps, is putting it mildly. The fact that Germany’s health minister yesterday thought it unnecessary to travel to a Health Council in Luxembourg where the main topic on the agenda was this serious infection crisis shows that he has absolutely no idea what Europe is really about and that he is ignorant, does not recognise the problems, or is still busy with internal party political crises. (Applause)
 What is more, I must observe – and Mr Dalli said it himself – that the German authorities clearly took the view that they would do without European Union experts, patronisingly and arrogantly believing that they had no need for them. Furthermore, the fact that it took three days for these experts to get into Germany is a scandal, and one that we must be critical of in this House. At the same time, however, we also have to say that it is our job, in the European Union, to warn consumers when there is a dangerous foodstuff on the market. I say to you quite clearly – if there are dangerous bacteria on a cucumber or a lettuce that do not lead to death, that may be a good thing, but for me it is not enough to justify a compensation case. Cucumbers from Spain and other countries did have EHEC bacteria on them. They were not the bacteria behind this outbreak, but it takes a while to find that out. For me, that is not the point, either. Those of you who understand the European Union and know the early warning system also know how the early warning system works. You know that, in the early warning system, the product and also the name of the producer must be named. You can also look that up easily in the legislation. For me, the important question is what will happen in future? In the future, we need to consider whether slurry use can continue. Could there still be production methods that are unacceptable? Who, in the European Union, actually monitors what, when and with what result this is documented, and who has what obligations in that regard? (Applause) President. − 
 Thank you very much. To those Members who wish to avail of the ‘catch-the-eye’ procedure, I would say that we already have approximately 20 speeches and that I do not believe we shall have enough time before the vote. However, you are still welcome to try. President.  
– The joint debate is closed. The vote on the two reports will take place at midday today, 8 March. This will be followed by celebrations to mark the 100th anniversary of International Women’s Day. All the women in the Chamber, in Parliament, in the Commission and in the Council are cordially requested to attend a joint photo call after the ceremony. I hope that this announcement will be heard by all the ladies and gentlemen in their offices and that they will attend the plenary directly. Written statements (Rule 149) Dagmar Roth-Behrendt,

 Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, we can all imagine the nightmare. Someone we know is ill and in a desperate situation. They are given medicines, but the medicines have no effect, because they have been falsified. We are grateful to the Commission for producing this proposal. It is true that we have been discussing it for some time. We began our debates in the previous parliamentary term and I would like to thank Mr Adamou, who is no longer a Member of this Parliament, for the preliminary work that he did on behalf of Mrs Matias. I believe that we have reached a good compromise, as Mrs Grossetête has said. Yes, we could have gone further. We are all impatient and we all want greater safety, but this is a good compromise. What have we achieved? We have made patient safety the central feature of the legislation. The safety measures that we have put in place will ensure that products are traceable throughout the entire distribution chain. Medicines can be traced from the manufacturer to the pharmacist. They will have an identifier which makes it immediately obvious if they are falsified or duplicated or if there are any irregularities, which can then be followed up. We have deliberately done this in such a way that the costs of the system remain at a reasonable level for everyone involved and that the system is not excessive. However, we are also not compromising on patient safety. This traceability is accompanied by the fact that the packaging must be undamaged, so that a patient who is given a pack can see that it has not been opened because it has an intact seal. In addition, there will be no more packs of medicines which are divided in two, as frequently used to be the case. All of this will improve safety levels and increase patients’ confidence. What else have we achieved? We have implemented an early warning system. This is excellent because it is the same system which has been in place for decades for foods and which we take for granted. There is an early warning system throughout the European Union for contaminated food. It is hard to believe that we have not had the same thing for medicines. If a falsified medicine is discovered, it is now possible to send out an early warning. The Member States must identify the patients who are affected, inform everyone involved and make sure that the risk involved in a medicine which is in circulation is made public. We take this for granted in the case of cars and food, but it has not been available so far for something as essential as medicines. As far as the Internet is concerned, anyone who accesses an illegal website must be able to recognise that it is illegal. This is why we must certify legal websites which, in future, will have a link to the website of the national approval body. They will be able to display a logo which will be developed by the European Commission. Everyone who buys medicines on the Internet can do so independently. They can tell whether they are dealing with a safe, legal website or an illegal one. All of this is a milestone, a quantum leap forward in patient safety. If we adopt this legislation tomorrow, we can be proud of what we have done and we should also make our achievements clear to the general public. President. −

 Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, this legislation is actually superfluous. I hope that it will continue to be superfluous because patients will not need to make use of it. In an ideal world, patients would receive the best healthcare most quickly in the country of their birth or the country where they live. The fact that we are discussing this today and adopting the legislation tomorrow is, as Mr Liese has rightly said, indicative of a cynical approach among the Member States. It means that the Member States have not recognised what they owe to their citizens, in other words, rapid, effective and high quality healthcare. It also shows that they would rather invest in other things than in these areas which provide services for their citizens and that is a disgrace. In addition, the negotiations in the Council on this subject are not something to be proud of. However, if this legislation is actually applied at some point, because patients need it, and that is not a good thing, I will be very pleased about what we have achieved. I am grateful to the rapporteur, Mrs Grossetête, and to my fellow Members for their cooperation. We have achieved a great deal. We have succeeded finally in putting the focus on rare diseases. People with these illnesses have always been sidelined and have found it difficult to obtain any treatment at all. We have at last managed to establish information points in the Member States which will inform people about their rights. There has been nothing of this kind available in the past. If reference networks are set up in future, it will finally be possible for the Member States to share best practices, information about gold and platinum standards and scientific progress. This has not been coordinated until now. There are some individual beacons of excellence, but no coordination. All of these things represent major successes, together with outpatient care and other areas which I will not go into now. Of course, there are also things that make me feel sad. I would have preferred not to have had the fuss and squabbling about prior authorisation, which simply shows that the Member States have not recognised the things that are really important. Fortunately, however, there are some Member States with which we can work well and we have demonstrated that today. Our objective must be to ensure that the healthcare system in every country is so good that no one wants to travel to another country whose language they do not speak. If what we are doing today and tomorrow is a small step towards this, because it will become clearer which countries have good services and which have poor services, which are doing something for their citizens and which are not, then we will have achieved a great deal. I hope that one of the minor side-effects of this will be transparency. We need to know which Member States have high standards and which are at a low level. I come from a country where I can feel relatively relaxed. However, I am aware of the problems of people in many other Member States and I feel ashamed about this, because it is not worthy of the European Union. I would like to thank the rapporteur for her hard work and, in particular, the Commission, Mr Dalli and his team, who have given the European Parliament and the father of this legislation in the previous parliamentary term, Mr Bowis, as much support as we could have wished for. I would also like to thank particularly the Belgian Presidency, which is not present today, but which has done everything possible to ensure that this process was successful. Although the Belgian Presidency did everything in its power, it could not always achieve a great deal, because of the sometimes stubborn, antediluvian attitudes of other Member States. However, something has been done and I believe that we will be able to vote in favour of this legislation tomorrow with a clear conscience. (Applause) President. − 
 Colleagues, just to let the speaker and everybody know what is happening, we now have three more people who want to ask a blue-card question. As this possibility has been introduced by the working group on parliamentary reform, I am very sympathetic to that and we have enough time, but nevertheless I have to ask the speaker if he will take all those questions. Then I would ask everybody whether we can take the questions in turn and then ask Mr Hökmark to answer. We will then finalise that part of the speaking time. President. − 
 Mr Swoboda, I fully support what you have said. It is very rude and lacking in respect. Mr De Rossa, a point of order? President.

 Mr President, let us approach this whole process rather more calmly. Usually, the Vice-Presidents of Parliament are elected in a block at the start of the legislative period or in the course of the legislative period. When we do that, fellow Members, we only ever find out the number of ‘Yes’ votes cast for a candidate – which also decides the order in which Members are elected to the Bureau. Now, because a Member has left, we are voting in one more Vice-President today – so the only important thing is whether he has received the number of ‘Yes’ votes required for election. Anything else makes no difference. It is different to other votes. (Applause)
 The President of Parliament has given a perfect description of the secret ballot, and it worked beautifully for me without my having to press various buttons. I pressed the button that I wanted to press and the blue light appeared. Perhaps we could simply all try it together once more, Mr President. (Applause) President.

 Mr President, Mr Barroso, our circumstances are different and we have a different institutional structure. Now that the Treaty of Lisbon is in place, the three institutions – Parliament, the Council and the European Commission – will have to work together in a different way to how they have done up to now. I believe that we all need to be interested in making this a success. Your involvement in the first part of the interinstitutional agreement gives me the impression – and I am not always uncritical of you – that you want this, too. The first part of this agreement that we have negotiated with you contains important elements for the role of the European Parliament in our cooperation with you, in particular, but also with the Council. These elements are the strengthening of the dialogue between Parliament and the European Commission, the possibility of receiving more information than we have done in the past, in other words, to be able to be an equal partner in the legislative process, and a genuine question time in which commissioners, who are, ultimately, politicians, come here and answer questions and give speeches and responses, without hiding away as they have done in the past. Previously, only you, Mr Barroso, had the courage to do that. Now, all of them will do so. That is a good thing. It will benefit all of us, and it will also be beneficial for European democracy and, hopefully, also for the interest of citizens in what we do, namely our legislative work for everyone. Finally, Mr Barroso, with regard to the question of legislative initiative, I firmly believe that, with what we were able to achieve in the negotiations with you regarding our cooperation and what we have today shaped into a resolution, we have come as close to the right of initiative for the European Parliament as we possibly can. It furthermore rules out the sui generis
 construct. You worked with us on this and you worked earnestly on it. I respect that and very much appreciate how you have contributed to this. The impact assessments have already been mentioned by other Members. You have undertaken to make this transparent and to act in a cooperative manner. You said that social impact assessments are important to you. That is an essential point from our perspective. I am completely happy with this. I believe that we should begin the work today, and not before time. President.  
– I would remind the Members once again that the Blue Card system created by the Working Party on Parliamentary Reform does not apply to the Commission and the Council, but only to debates amongst Members of this House.

– Thank you very much, Mrs Gräßle. As you are addressing the Commission directly, I would encourage the Commissioner to listen closely to what you have to say. That makes it much easier to answer afterwards. President.  
– Thank you very much, Commissioner Šemeta. There were a few more questions from the Members, but it is my understanding that you do not want to answer Mr Garriga and the other Members directly. Perhaps you would like to get your answers to the Members in question in writing. They would certainly appreciate that enormously.

 Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, to take Ms Schaldemose’s example, if we imagine that we had a USB stick and every computer had a different access port, we would all have to buy different adaptors. This example alone shows how important standardisation is and the great extent to which it can make life easier for citizens. This is a very important issue that we have to debate here. We, in Parliament, have also succeeded in adding many improvements to the Commission’s text. I would therefore like to offer my sincere thanks to the rapporteur and to our shadow rapporteur for their outstanding work. There were, however, two points – to single out just a couple of topics, for time reasons – that were particularly close to our hearts. First of all, we had the support for small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs) – which was a very important point for us – and ensuring that standardisation is not only the realm of large companies, but also respects the needs of SMEs. In cases like this, the risk is, of course, always very large that the large companies will go ahead and implement and the small companies will have to catch up, which can be a cost-intensive exercise. We have also managed to ensure that the support and the funding in this area have been safeguarded. The second area that was important to us was the removal of a section of the services that have recently been incorporated into this process, in particular, the removal of services of common economic interest and those of major importance to the professions. In this area, standardisation could be very dangerous, as these are fields that depend on creativity and the flexibility of service providers, and these must be safeguarded. We have reached a satisfactory compromise in this regard, and one in favour of which we, as a group, feel able to vote. As I said, though, there was a lot of work to do and I hope that things will be somewhat easier from here on in. Evelyne Gebhardt,  
rapporteur for the opinion of the Committee on the Internal Market and Consumer Protection.

 Mr President, we were very disappointed, Mr Barnier, to find that, in contrast to what was announced in the work programme for 2011, there was no legislative proposal, but merely a recommendation to the Member States. Therefore, I very much welcome the fact that today, you are showing your determination to submit a legislative proposal by the autumn at the latest, I hope, because we all know that calls to the Commission simply do not achieve anything. A total of 30 million citizens are waiting to have access to a basic account, so that they can perform the fundamental tasks that are part of life in today’s society. These 30 million citizens are seasonal workers, people on low incomes, the homeless and students, and all of them have a right to a bank account. We need to make sure that they get one. The basic account must also be cost-effective. We must not allow these people to be excluded again because of the cost, because they have no address or for some of the other reasons that are often given. We must ensure that they have a right to a bank account, because we cannot accept a situation in our society where there are first and second class citizens. For this reason, I very much hope that you will be able to persuade the College of Commissioners very quickly. We will help you, Mr Barnier, to make sure that the Member States ultimately also agree, because these really are fundamental rights. Evelyne Gebhardt  (S&amp;D
).

Mr President, Commissioner, Mr Creutzmann, I believe that we are facing a very important issue here, and one that must be solved, regulated. I therefore very much welcomed it when the Commission brought forward this legislative proposal. This is about the safety of our citizens. We have obtained a great deal of information about how problematic counterfeit products are for people’s health and well-being, but also for pricing, and how important it is for businesses to be able to sell products that they have actually produced, in which connection it goes without saying that intellectual property rights must be properly protected. There are, however, a few issues that are still subject to fierce debate within Parliament. One such issue seems to have been resolved to some extent, and in that regard I would like to offer my sincere thanks to Ms Hedh, who produced great work in connection with generic medicines. The transiting issue is an absolutely essential issue in this context. We cannot accept the introduction of obstacles here that actually have nothing to do with the protection of intellectual property but relate to entirely different issues. We need to very carefully weigh up what we do in this area. Otherwise, Ms Hedh provided a very clear picture of what problems result in this context. The second point, which we believe to be very important – and, in this regard, I was very pleased by what you had to say earlier in respect of patent infringements, Mr Šemeta – is that the rule of law must be safeguarded in all cases. For that reason, if two of the amendments tabled by our group are not adopted, we as a group will not ultimately be able to vote in favour of the Creutzmann report, as we want there to be legal certainty here, but also that the rule of law and the rights of citizens in this connection should be safeguarded. It is therefore not all the same to us how the final vote goes. Our final vote tomorrow is therefore actually still in the balance. Evelyne Gebhardt,  
on behalf of the S&amp;D Group.

 Mr President, Commissioner, on the 20th anniversary of the internal market, the issue of the internal market really deserves the attention we are giving it today. It is one of our great achievements that we can move freely in the European Union, that we can sell our goods throughout Europe, that we have a high degree of product safety, and that we can bring citizens together here in this House, and it is a delight that we are working on it. It is therefore important, Mr Barnier, that you continue on the path you have embarked upon so as to ensure, together with us, that the positive aspects of the internal market are brought closer to citizens and that they recognise what they have gained from the European internal market. That is something that is missing, that citizens do not recognise, because we talk too much about problems and not enough about the achievements of the European Union. It is therefore also important that we concentrate more on what we have enshrined in Article 3 of the Treaty of Lisbon, which is that we want to have and also need a social market economy – and I place particular emphasis on the word ‘social’ – so that workers and consumers recognise themselves in Europe. I would also like to praise what Louis Grech highlighted in his report by adopting an holistic approach, which we need so that we can really see the internal market as a global concept and not as disconnected small actions that run alongside each other, and with which a philosophy of Europe is truly associated. It is really important to work on this together and we should continue to do so. The internal market is good, but there is one thing we should not forget: it must be structured for the benefit of citizens and not just for the benefit of enterprises and the financial world.

 Madam President, good levels of cooperation with the Member States of the European Economic Area (EEA) and the European Free Trade Association (EFTA) are very important to us. We enjoy a privileged relationship, which we wish to develop further in a highly positive way. However, this also means that both sides must adhere to existing agreements and, as the European Parliament and as Europeans, we must take care to ensure that no discrimination between the Member States of the European Union is allowed to creep in, whether in the interpretation of the wording of agreements, or in any other way. That is why I fail to understand the approach taken by the Swiss in applying the quota provisions that Switzerland is entitled to impose under the agreements. What we find unacceptable is that a distinction is made between Member States, in other words between the citizens of eight Member States of the European Union and the remaining States of the Union. This runs counter to the spirit of the European Union. We are all equal and must all be treated equally. That is why we cannot accept a distinction in this case. The provisions of Article 10 of the 1999 Agreement relate to employed and self-employed persons from the European Community. This is stated clearly in the agreements and we must insist that all citizens of the European Community are dealt with equally. This is the reason for our question to the European Commission regarding the status of discussions in this area with Switzerland. We would also ask you to clarify that we do not have first and second class citizens in the European Union and that the quota provision must apply to the European Community as a whole and that no distinction between citizens is permitted.

 Mr President, as there is a certain amount of confusion in my group with regard to what we are actually voting on here, I would like to point out that we are talking about a reference to the WARF judgment by the European Patent Office in which we want the whole of the technical theory behind the application to be taken into account. It is not about stem cells – they have absolutely nothing to do with this resolution. Evelyne Gebhardt,  
on behalf of the S&amp;D Group.

 Mr President, Mr De Gucht, this is an extremely important discussion. Of course, we are all in favour of inventions being patented and of protecting new products in a way that genuinely benefits the people who have invented them. However, when it comes to breeding methods in biological fields, we need to consider very carefully what actually constitutes an invention and what is just a discovery or a development of a natural breeding method. That is one of the questions which arises in the context of patenting. There are some cases, including tomatoes and broccoli, where we have to ask ourselves in which direction the Convention on the Grant of European Patents is moving. Mr De Gucht, you have yourself just admitted that, as far as patentability and the implementation and interpretation of the law in this field are concerned, there are some grey areas. It is precisely these grey areas we are referring to when we say that we need to think about how we handle this issue. We must ensure that the wide range of different varieties and breeds that we have in the European Union and the varied breeding methods, all of which have their own value, are not destroyed by patent claims that are too far-reaching. We must also ensure that small and medium-sized businesses can continue to develop and exercise their breeders’ privilege and that this is not ruined by granting patents which will prevent this privilege from being applied and which will no longer allow these businesses to make free use of the natural material that is readily available. This is one of the points that concerns us and we are asking the Commission, Mr De Gucht, to focus its attention on this area and to evaluate to what extent the bans which we imposed in the directive on the legal protection of biotechnological inventions, and which involved heated debates at the time, are really being respected. The principle that what the European Patent Office has laid down, in other words, that not only the explicit wording of the claims but also the overall technical theory behind the application needs to be considered, must be applied and respected.

Mr President, Commissioner, consumers experience a great deal of uncertainty when they go into shops and see a locally produced product. No one knows what that actually means. Does it actually come from somewhere local or is the yoghurt that is claimed to be local perhaps produced using milk that had first been transported a thousand kilometres? Is that what we as consumers want? It is time that we clarified what is actually meant by the term ‘locally produced’. Many citizens would like to know that. This is not because they want to pursue food nationalism, but because they take protection of the climate and the environment seriously, and they say: these natural products that I am buying today do not need to come from a long distance away when they can also be produced locally, and I would prefer that. These things are important. We want clarity so that responsible citizens can also take responsible decisions. After all, what does it mean to be able to take responsible decisions? It means receiving the information that you need to formulate the decision accordingly. These are things that we need to clarify. The Commission has, in fact, started to consider this matter. I would be very grateful, Commissioner, if you could tell us by when we can expect action to be taken by the Commission. When will we potentially also have legislative proposals on the table with which we will be able to provide citizens with an answer to these pressing questions? It is not a question of preventing products from coming from other countries. I always look forward to the delicious products from Spain that I can buy in Germany, because they cannot be produced in Germany. However, there are also products that are produced locally. It is important for us to ensure that citizens know where a product comes from, what the quality of the product is, and that there is not always a riddle associated with it in terms of how the information should be interpreted, what the quality label that they see means, and whether it actually has any value or any real meaning. This is the legal certainty that we want for our citizens. Evelyne Gebhardt  (S&amp;D
).

 Mr President, Commissioner Barnier, as rapporteur for the Services Directive, I did ensure, at that time, that services of common economic interest and services of general interest were excluded from the scope of that directive. At the same time I said that it is absolutely necessary for these services to be regulated at European level in order to protect them. Since then, we have seen the advent of the Treaty of Lisbon and its supplementary Protocol No 26, which gives the Commission a duty. Commission President Barroso promised us that he would act in this regard and we await real and substantial action from the Commission in this area. My question for you, Commissioner, is: when can we expect a legislative text from you? This is something that is needed, in my opinion. It is needed not because we want to regulate these services, but because we want to ensure that these services continue to remain in the hands of the competent people and bodies in the Member States, and with the highest possible level of quality. Evelyne Gebhardt  (S&amp;D
). 
 – (DE)
 Mr President, with respect, Commissioner, I do not see this the same way as you. What you have just presented is a breakdown of the legislation, and not the implementation of what is stipulated under Protocol No 26 of the Treaty of Lisbon, which quite clearly sets out that we need a legislative framework within which the protection of these services of general economic interest is to be regulated. That is something quite different to what you just presented to us I would like to know when you actually intend to implement the Treaty on European Union. Evelyne Gebhardt,  
rapporteur for the opinion of the Committee on the Internal Market and Consumer Protection
. – (DE) 
Madam President, the Committee on the Internal Market and Consumer Protection has also deliberated in detail on the Single Euro Payments Area, or SEPA, because this issue is very much concerned with consumer protection. I can state that I am very happy with the compromise reached, because it also incorporates some of the topics adopted by us in committee. It is a very good thing that we can say to consumers that we are thinking of them, too, in the area of the financial markets, because they do not always get that impression. Borders for payment transactions are borders in Europe. It is time that these were removed, so that they no longer stand in the way of European mobility. I very much welcome the fact that it has been established that, in future, all enterprises and consumers will be able to make euro payment transactions in other European countries from a single account at any bank. This is very important, particularly for small and medium-sized enterprises. Not just for enterprises, though, but also for consumers who are mobile, who go on holiday and who want to make credit transfers. It is also very good that we have ensured that there is a single migration date for credit transfers and direct debits. It would not have been good for consumers to have two different dates, as that would have resulted in greater confusion. Clarity and legal certainty – that is what we need, and that is what we have achieved here. My third and last point concerns the information given to citizens. That is also extremely important. A great many of them are afraid of this new SEPA number, of the new IBAN code, because it seems too long to them. If we tell them quite clearly how it is composed, however, then they will not find it so difficult and complicated at all. In other words, it is very important that we have an information campaign so that people know what this is all about. Evelyne Gebhardt,

 Mr President, Commissioner, the forum in Kraków really was a great success. This needs to be repeated, because good initiatives really ought to be continued. In this connection, I would like once again to thank Mr Grech, who as we know had the original idea that we should present the 20 most important concerns of citizens at such a forum. That was the key element of what we did, namely to place the concerns of citizens at the forefront so that they can see that the single market is not something abstract, but something that will actually provide them with added value. It concerned such diverse issues as the recognition of professional qualifications, the opportunity for young people to open a bank account in another Member State – which is sometimes very difficult – legal certainty in connection with online shopping, the Posting of Workers Directive, which urgently needs to be updated and amended, the strengthening of small and medium-sized enterprises and so on. Many subjects were discussed and the relevant problems highlighted. Commissioner, in future we need to put greater emphasis on the solutions on offer. In this regard, we await everything that you as the Commission have promised for next year, and Parliament and my group, the Group of the Progressive Alliance of Socialists and Democrats in the European Parliament, will monitor what you present to us with a very critical, but positive eye. Evelyne Gebhardt  (S&amp;D
). 
 – (DE) 
Madam President, the streamlining of the law in this area of mutual recognition of professional qualifications is extremely important. After all, we want policies that are in the best interests of our citizens. We all want our citizens to be able to move about freely and pursue their careers throughout the European Union. There are still far too many problems and obstacles raised by the Member States, as well as difficulties posed by European law, and it is important that we should tackle this issue. I am grateful to Mr Barnier, however, because he has stated that the answer does not necessarily lie in the deregulation of regulated professions. Those who favour such a move still have not indicated which professions they would like to see deregulated. I would like to know: are they talking about doctors, engineers or architects? I am not sure. What I am sure about is that regulation is extremely important and necessary. With regard to the professional card: this is something that would allow our citizens genuine freedom of movement, which is why we should not spend too much time on analysis, but instead should respond to the need expressed by those affected. Engineers and doctors were the first to say that they needed something like this to be able to move more freely around Europe, which is, after all, a political union. It is for this reason that we must say yes to this, and do so as quickly as possible. Evelyne Gebhardt  (S&amp;D

 Madam President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, public procurement is an extremely important task that we have for the future. I very much welcome the fact that the European Commission intends not only to improve legal certainty, but also to put right some aspects that have gone wrong. I would also like to thank the rapporteur, Ms Rühle, for having included a couple of points that are extremely important to those of us who are members of the Group of the Progressive Alliance of Socialists and Democrats in the European Parliament. Firstly, there is the issue that we must ensure that the rights of workers are safeguarded and that social criteria enjoy a prominent place. That is very important to us, because global sustainability includes ensuring that we do not generate poverty tomorrow but that instead, when awarding contracts, we also ensure that reasonable prices are paid, enabling us to protect the lives of workers. Another important point for us was, and remains, the fact that subcontractors are treated in exactly the same way as contractors – so that when contracts are awarded to contractors, the criteria cannot then be set aside because their subcontractors do not have to adhere to them. This is not a pipe dream, but rather it is a point that is very important to us: ensuring that legal certainty is brought about in this respect, so that we can genuinely make sure that public procurement remains transparent and comprehensible to the public, and so as to ensure fair competition between enterprises – particularly where small and medium-sized enterprises are concerned. Far from being inappropriate criteria, therefore, these are criteria that are extremely important. Evelyne Gebhardt  (S&amp;D
). 
 – (DE)
 Madam President, Mr Oettinger, the Commission shares the European Parliament’s concerns. This is very nice, but we have been waiting for years for the Commission to take action and to make some genuine progress in this area. We have Mr Busuttil’s report in front of us. In the last parliamentary term, the Committee on the Internal Market and Consumer Protection repeatedly highlighted the fact that we finally need to do something to help people. The problem is that people are still waiting for this help to arrive. Many of the small voluntary organisations that are affected do not have the financial means or the chutzpah to defend themselves. Only last week I received another letter asking: ‘How can I defend myself? I do not have the money for a lawyer, so I cannot take legal proceedings’. I believe that we must finally give the citizens of Europe an effective means of ridding themselves of this problem. Evelyne Gebhardt,  
on behalf of the S&amp;D Group.

 Mr President, I very much hope that it will be possible to rescue the 200 people who are in distress, because this is a very important matter. Thank you for informing us about this. Mr Barnier, Mrs Győri, ladies and gentlemen, Article 3 of the Treaty of Lisbon, which enshrines the social market economy, represents a new approach and a new political task for the future. Of course, we now have to complete this task and we have been waiting to do so for the last two years. I am pleased that the European Commission has made the first move in this direction. I am also very pleased that we in the Group of the Progressive Alliance of Socialists and Democrats in the European Parliament have succeeded, after a hard struggle, in ensuring that the social clause is included in the European Parliament’s position when we vote on this issue today. This is a very important question, because it forms the basis for social cohesion and will enable us to ensure that the internal market is regarded by people in the European Union as a social component. This is essential if we want the citizens of Europe to regain their trust in the political system in the European Union. In particular, the Commission must finally acknowledge the decisive significance of social rights in the internal market and put the focus on the social impact of European legislation. This is why it is important for Parliament to remind the Commission once again about the social clause which is enshrined in the Treaty of Lisbon. I would like to thank Mr Barnier for assuring us that he will take this into consideration and will follow this route. He can be sure of the full support of the Group of the Progressive Alliance of Socialists and Democrats in the European Parliament. Mr Barnier, the social clause also means, of course, that the Posting of Workers Directive must be revised accordingly. It means that the right to work and to strike must be respected in the Member States, together with the issues which really concern people, and that these rights must be incorporated into the internal market policy of the European Union without any ifs and buts and without restrictions. That is what concerns us as Social Democrats. If the internal market is developed on this basis, we will give you our support and our policy will be moving in the right direction. Of course, other questions are also important in this context. The recognition of professional qualifications, the European qualifications passport and the full transferability of pensions within the European Union are all issues which interest the citizens of Europe and which will ensure that the internal market is a market for the people. This is exactly what we Social Democrats are always saying. The economy is there for the people and not vice versa. If we follow this path, then we will be on the right track. Evelyne Gebhardt  (S&amp;D
).

 Mr President, I support the proposal by the Group of the European People’s Party (Christian Democrats), as it makes perfect sense to discuss this. I would just ask – in agreement with the coordinator of the Committee on the Internal Market and Consumer Protection, Mr Schwab – that we do not vote on the resolution this week, but wait until May to do so, because we have not yet had time to discuss this among the groups. Thus, I would say ‘yes’ to the inclusion of this item on the agenda, ‘yes’ to a resolution, but I would like the vote on the resolution to wait until May. Evelyne Gebhardt  (S&amp;D
). 
 – (DE)
 Mr President, I asked that the vote on the resolution on public procurement be postponed until May, which, of course, means that the deadline for the submission of resolutions and amendments would then also be postponed accordingly. You have not given us a chance to vote on that yet. Evelyne Gebhardt,  
on behalf of the S&amp;D Group.
 – (DE)
 Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, we did indeed experience some very tough negotiations, Mr Schwab, as opinions were very divided at the start of discussions. Likewise, it was not easy to decide on a reasonable course of action. However, these negotiations did succeed in achieving significant improvements, even after the vote at committee level, which finally made it possible for my group to vote in favour of this compromise package tomorrow. After all the discussions we have held, you will be aware of how much this means. We have indeed made a number of improvements. Accordingly, the fundamental principle followed in the directive is now, once again, minimum harmonisation – with the exception of the areas that are to be fully harmonised, which was an important concern for us. We excluded social services, healthcare services and games of chance from the scope of this directive because these are the areas that require special regulation. You cannot apply the same principles to them as to commercial services, commodities or retailing and so this was an important consideration. We have significantly strengthened the obligations to provide information to our citizens, the consumers. For this reason I would like to make it clear to the President-in-Office of the Council that the idea of dropping Chapter 2, in other words removing exactly the areas where this obligation to provide information is to apply, is something that the Group of the Progressive Alliance of Socialists and Democrats in the European Parliament will not tolerate. We have included electronic products in the scope of the directive, something not envisaged in the Commission’s original proposal. However, distance selling via the Internet is one of the key areas that has been included. As we reached the home straight, we also succeeded in improving the provisions on door-to-door selling. These are positive improvements that have enabled us to lend our support. I cannot deny that a few problems still exist, in particular the clauses relating to unfair contract terms in Chapter 5. We are very dissatisfied with these provisions and will either have to do some more work here or, if necessary, omit this section entirely. However, something that causes even more difficulty is the fact that financial services have been completely excluded from the obligations to provide information. I think we have a serious problem here. We will have to discuss this further, Commissioner, because financial services were included in your proposals and this should remain the case. To summarise: we will vote in favour of the compromise package and will also vote to refer the directive back to committee, but this does not mean that we agree to adopt the directive at first reading. Evelyne Gebhardt,  
rapporteur. 
– (DE)
 Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, here in the European Parliament, we have been debating the Services Directive for a long time, and we have expressed many concerns in our debates about how it should be implemented and how we can ensure that service providers have free movement within the European Union. This was an important piece of policy. That is why we, as Parliament, decided that we not only wanted to make the legislation, but that we also wanted to monitor how the Services Directive is actually transposed in the Member States. It is in our interest that the directive be transposed properly, correctly and well. The European Commission also agreed to help us in this regard. I would therefore like to thank Commissioner Barnier, who has provided us with valuable information in this connection. We have particular concerns about four specific areas, namely, the evaluation procedure, the points of single contact, administrative cooperation and the scope of the directive. On the first point, I have the following to say. Mutual evaluation is one of the core items where we, as Parliament, and I, as the then rapporteur, said actually, we are opposed to this, as this means an awful lot of bureaucracy in the Member States. I am also hearing from the Member States today that there are indeed complaints about the bureaucracy. In that regard, however, I would quite simply like to make it very clear to the Member States once again that they were the ones that wanted this, not Parliament! They inserted it into the legislation and, as such, they should take the responsibility for it themselves even if, for example, local communities are beginning to discuss what Europe has done to them again. On the question of the second point – the points of single contact – I would say that this is the answer to what we have done in the political sense. We said quite clearly that the principle of the Services Directive is not the country of origin principle but the country of destination principle. That means that service providers must respect the law of the State in which they operate. That makes it all the more important that they obtain from the points of single contact not only the information about the laws that they have to respect, but also the necessary assistance to enable them to really apply that law properly and consistently in the Member States. I therefore find it very regrettable that, while these points of single contact have been set up in many Member States – although not all of them as yet – this has only been done in a very unsatisfactory way. In some cases, they are merely Internet portals. That does not satisfy us, the European Parliament – there needs to be much more behind these points of single contact. There need to be people behind them who can provide real assistance for the service providers in this area. One issue here is the language that is provided. It is not enough to offer the local language and perhaps English. In my view – and Parliament has spoken in similar terms – it is important for service providers that the language of the neighbouring county is also spoken. I say this with one eye on our Polish President – in the border area between Germany and Poland, German should be offered in Poland and Polish in Germany so that the information and assistance are actually really good, so that even the small businesses, which are not all competent in English, can really get involved in cross-border activities. Administrative cooperation is another important point and it is an area where we are heading in the right direction. In this regard, the Member States still have an awful lot more to do in the area of cooperation and of the education and training of officials, so that this system can be really well used. Finally, we come to the scope, in which connection I would like to make it quite clear, once again, that we excluded all services of common economic interest from the scope of Article 16. I expect the Member States to respect that. If they want to include these services in the scope of the Services Directive, that is their right, but in that case, they must not sweep it all up as part of the Services Directive; rather, it is their own political statement of intent and something that they should also assume responsibility for themselves. That is what I demand of the Member States in this context. Evelyne Gebhardt,  
rapporteur.
 – (DE)
 Mr President, this debate was very interesting and illuminating. There was one observation I have to make, though, and that was that there are still people who continue to have in their heads the old Bolkestein proposal, which actually provided for liberalisation and deregulation, despite the fact that that really is a thing of the past and that the Services Directive, as constituted at present, is about enabling people to use their qualifications to offer services across the European Union. That is what this Services Directive is about, and it is important to keep saying so. I would like to stress that once again and we have also made that change quite clear. In addition, I would also like to remind you all that we absolutely do have a social clause in the Services Directive. This is because we have included, in Article 1, a clause whereby the labour and social law of the Member States cannot be jeopardised by the application of the Services Directive. Thus, if something like that were to happen in a Member State – and I did say this at the beginning – that would be an incorrect implementation of the Services Directive. If you want to speak of the Rüffert case and others, that has no relevance to the Services Directive. Such cases relate to the Posting of Workers Directive and its implementation and to the public procurement directives. Please do not fall into the trap of comparing apples and oranges. While apples and oranges perhaps both produce a good fruit stew, that is completely the wrong approach to take in politics. We therefore really need to very closely monitor what happens. I repeat my call for us to ensure that the Services Directive is correctly transposed in the Member States and not used to take rights away or to deregulate – that is not the job of the Services Directive. Of course, it remains a quite clear demand for us that we in the European Union in any case need a legal framework to protect services of general economic interest. I am eager to see what the Commission will produce for us in this regard. Evelyne Gebhardt,  
on behalf of the S&amp;D Group.

 Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, I would like to express my very sincere thanks to the rapporteur, Mrs Stihler, who has done some very important work in this highly technical area. It is not only a technical report that we have before us; it is also a highly political report – a report in which high political standards also had to be respected. It was necessary to balance the various interests of industry, safety and the protection of workers, and, in the view of the European Parliament and the Group of the Progressive Alliance of Socialists and Democrats in the European Parliament, the rapporteur has succeeded admirably in doing this. It was essential to respect the interests of the industry and to see where their problems are in this area of construction products. It was also important to find a balance between the large and the small and medium-sized enterprises. Our view was that the Commission was right to suggest that small enterprises need fewer rules. However, that does not mean – and this is where the Commission’s proposal was improved upon – that a lower level of safety should be permitted. The level of the standards must also be genuinely high, something that we managed to achieve in this area. Of course, it is also important to place safety at the forefront. This is of particular importance for consumers because, where a construction product is manufactured and installed, it must be ensured that the user of the product is ultimately just as safe as those who worked with it beforehand. The third point that was particularly important to us, as Social Democrats, was improving worker protection and the fact that this has also been explicitly incorporated once again. Mrs Stihler also attached a great deal of importance to this in her remarks. After all, these construction products often involve work with hazardous substances and materials. It is extremely important to ensure that the highest possible level of protection is indeed achieved in this area. This level of protection will also need to be considered later – and that is something that we probably still need to work on, Mr Tajani – in connection with the disposal of these products once they are no longer needed. I would like to thank the rapporteur most sincerely once again for her truly splendid work. Evelyne Gebhardt,

 Mr President, Commissioner, I would like to express my thanks to Mrs Weisgerber for the truly collegial collaboration that we enjoyed. I would like to say, on behalf of my group, that I am far from euphoric about the repeal of these eight directives. There are, in fact, a number of outdated measuring instruments for which the rules and regulations are being abolished, but we have noted in the debates that the devil is in the detail, as you yourself have said. It therefore was not always clear whether this route really was the right one to choose. My group will vote in favour of this compromise in light of the fact that we have obtained an assurance from the Commission that it will examine the idea of properly incorporating these measurement instruments into the European Measuring Instruments Directive (MID), which is, of course, being drawn up at the moment, where necessary. This commitment to investigate – this, too, I am assuming – will also be taken very seriously and given earnest consideration. We are voting for the compromise on this condition, well aware that there are still one or two issues that need to be investigated. As for the correlation tables, I would like to say, at this point, that we have now stated that we are ready to accept the mild wording that is currently to be found in this text but that this is one of the last documents in which we have accepted this, as, for us, this really is about European law, which is created once the Member States have given their consent, being truly and properly implemented. We can only check that, however, if we have the information, and we only get the information from these correlation tables. We will continue to work towards that, at all events. Evelyne Gebhardt,

 Mr President, year after year, we have this debate about the safety of toys. Year after year, we have to observe that there is still much that is in need of improvement. We are talking, here, amongst other things, about what are known as carcinogenic, mutagenic and reprotoxic substances (CMRs), substances that cause cancer and that may be very hazardous to the health and, in some cases, even the life of children. The new information does indeed show that we need to ensure that the limit values are adapted and we are calling on the Commission to finally do so. Commissioner, I really hope that this will actually happen. This is not the only problem, however. There is another problem in the shape of market supervision, and the Member States, too, have a responsibility here. They have a responsibility to ensure that only toys that truly satisfy the safety standards that we have adopted reach the market. That is not always the case, which is highly regrettable. We therefore need to ensure that these safety standards are improved. The third and final point that I wish to make relates to the marking of toys. Many people wrongly believe that the CE mark is an indicator of safety. It is not, however, as the Commission itself says. It is therefore time, Commissioner, that the Commission gave some thought to how we could issue a European safety mark that is truly reliable and that is monitored by third parties, independent authorities or bodies, so that a dangerous toy simply cannot make it onto the market or into the shops where it can threaten the health of our children. I believe that we have a major debt to discharge in this regard, and there is still much that we need to do, and urgently so. Evelyne Gebhardt  (S&amp;D

 Mr President, Mr Barroso, ladies and gentlemen, I believe that we have made major progress on behalf of the citizens of Europe with the Treaty of Lisbon, because we have included the social market economy among the principles of European policy. It is clear that we as Europeans and as parliamentarians expect the social market economy to be turned into a reality. Now we are looking at the internal market itself and the issues relating to the internal market as a whole and we can see that some of the things which should have been included have been omitted. It is not enough to carry out social impact assessments of European legislation. We need a social clause to be put into practice, so that the promises which were made that the citizens would really benefit from Europe are fulfilled and do not simply remain on paper. This is not just about the social clause, but also about important issues such as the services of general economic interest, which require special protection. It is very important to me that the European Commission finally addresses this question and looks more closely at issues concerning workers than was necessary, for example, in the context of the Posting of Workers Directive, where we are still waiting to find out what will happen next. Finally, and now I am slowly starting to get really annoyed, we have been calling on the European Commission for a long time to introduce a system for class actions at a European level. The Commission has already carried out six or seven different studies. What do we find now in this work programme? Another study has been commissioned. We cannot go on like this. We want the Commission to finally come up with some proposals and decisions in this area. Evelyne Gebhardt,  
on behalf of the S&amp;D Group.

Madam President, thank you Commissioner Barnier for the work you have done. It was no easy task that you had and you have included something of what Professor Monti set out in his report and what Mr Grech drew up for the European Parliament. We can also see something of that in there, as well as the attempt to take the holistic approach, which has not succeeded in quite the way we imagined it would, but is nevertheless on the right track. It is also very important that you make it absolutely clear that you are attempting to make the social rights of citizens, which should, of course, be at the heart of the European Union’s legislation, a reality. However, on behalf of my group, I have to say that we feel some things in this text are too vague, too simple or too insignificant, or are missing altogether, because one of the crucial demands that we had, and which you also agreed to, was for a social clause to be included in all important areas of European policy. We cannot find this social clause. A commitment to carrying out social impact assessments could satisfy us. However, a social clause is significantly more than what we find here in this text. We will endeavour to help you so that we make progress in the right direction, because this is very important to us. There is another point that I find quite problematic and that was also very important to our group. We are calling for collective redress. We want collective redress for citizens so that they are also genuinely able to assert their consumer protection rights. On behalf of the European Commission, you announced that more studies are to be carried out. Studies have been carried out in this area for three years. I think it is time for us to get on with it and for us to actually receive a legislative proposal from you, not merely another proposal for a study to be carried out, so that we can see how we can move forward from here. As you see, there are some things that we are satisfied with, but other things that we are not so happy about and we will work hard with you, the Council and our fellow Members from the other groups to ensure that we ultimately have a genuinely good text.

 The fight against terrorism requires international cooperation governed by agreements. However, these must not erode the fundamental rights of citizens laid down in the European Charter of Fundamental Rights. In modern times in particular, these rights also include the protection of data, which is not adequately guaranteed by the SWIFT agreement negotiated with the United States. Combating terrorism must not become an excuse for inadequate data protection. Other serious shortcomings in this agreement include, for example, the inspection of bank data without judicial approval, the long retention period for data, something that is impermissible under German constitutional law, as well as an inadequate opportunity for people to defend themselves in court against the unfair use of data. These are serious infringements of fundamental rights. However, the European Union is not permitted to unduly curtail existing fundamental rights. I therefore still reject this SWIFT agreement.

Mr President, Mr Grech, I would like to congratulate you on the truly excellent report which you have tabled before us here and which provides us with a basis from which to move forward. Thank you also for using a phrase which I myself use all the time, namely that the economy is there for the people and not the other way around. That is precisely what the policy of the European Union should be based on. In your report, you also quite rightly point out that an adequate assessment of the social, consumer-related, environmental and economic impacts of the internal market, and the decisions we make in the internal market, are of particular importance. That is precisely what has been missing so far or what has not been made sufficiently visible to our citizens. It is a very important approach to point out the actual humanist and holistic elements of our policy, even when it comes to the internal market. In your report, you also state one thing which is particularly important for us Social Democrats, and that is that social policy should be considered as a core of internal market policy and that protecting services of a general economic interest is of particular importance. In addition, you call for the development of a strategy for improved communication of the social advantages of the internal market. If we consider just these few points, we realise that we could achieve a great deal if only the European Commission gave us its backing. I also very much hope that the Commission will genuinely take the opportunity presented by the Grech report to put the progress of EU citizens centre stage. I make that plea very strongly and, as we know, Mr Barnier has already agreed to do so. If we approach the internal market from that angle, the policy of the European Union will meet with greater acceptance and we will be able to look towards a better future. Evelyne Gebhardt,  
on behalf of the S&amp;D Group.

 Madam President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, as I follow this debate, I note that there is actually a great deal of uncertainty in relation to how the law is to be applied in these areas. Mr Andor, you just said that there is no European regulation laying down EUR 33 000 as a fixed limit. Dutch legislators, however, have laid down this limit of their own free will, probably because they were afraid that otherwise, the Commission would, at some point, require clear criteria to be put in place. This uncertainty leads to a great many difficulties in the Member States in relation to taking decisions themselves, specifically in terms of shaping those decisions so that they truly match up to what we need for these people and, in particular, for social housing, as these are people who do not have enough money to be able to move about freely. It is therefore very important for us to create a legal framework and legal certainty that also properly clarifies what is possible. Services of general economic interest, of course, really do need to be protected. They are provided at the local level in the Member States and they are universal and we need to ensure that they really are offered to everyone. We therefore have to consider – and I know this is being considered in the Committee on Employment and Social Affairs – demanding from the Commission a legal framework to protect services of general economic interest, especially in the social field, and I think that such a framework, were it to be provided, would be a good thing. Evelyne Gebhardt  (S&amp;D

 Mr President, Commissioner, Mr Manders, thank you very much for the good work that you have put into this regulation. I would also like to give particular thanks to my shadow rapporteur, since although this is indeed a technical report – as has been mentioned a number of times – it has many wide-ranging consequences for our citizens. After all, what we are concerned with here is allowing novel fibres to be placed on the market in the European Union. That is something we want to make possible. The European Commission is right in that. Not just anyhow, however; the fibres must be tested if citizens are genuinely to enjoy the consumer protection that we are always talking about. It is important, for example, to test whether the fibres are allergenic. They must also be clearly labelled, so that our citizens – who are always being described as responsible citizens – can also act accordingly. In this context, I must contradict the Members who have said that we should leave out country-of-origin marking. It is very important and absolutely right. Many citizens want to know where the fibres and textiles come from. What is their background? Their background includes the way in which they were manufactured. It is deplorable, but in many states, child labour or even slave labour are still used. There are citizens who want to know this information so that they can make a responsible choice when buying products. It may not be the job of this regulation, but it is the job of us Members to remind the Council of this and exert pressure to ensure that the text on origin marking that has been on the table since 2005 is at last put to good use. It is an opportunity to turn up this pressure and we should really seize it to achieve a good regulation about which our citizens say: yes, we can certainly live with that – that is the sort of thing we expect of our representatives in Parliament.

 Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, my group would actually have liked to support Mrs Rühle’s report, because it contains a great many very positive elements. Unfortunately, there are three points that we consider lacking or that we are unable to accept as they stand in the report. Firstly, Mrs Rühle was unable to accept that we genuinely have need of a legal framework for services in the general economic interest, and secondly, she also failed to state clearly that it is a matter of greater legal certainty in the area of social services in particular. This is a shortcoming of the report that we naturally find very regrettable. One point that we are absolutely unable to accept is the rejection of service concessions. We cannot simply say that it is something we do not want. The Court of Justice has already ruled on all this. It is highly unpolitical. It is very important that we say quite clearly what we want if we know that the European Commission is preparing a legal text. It is important that we call upon the European Commission actually to go along with the very positive position taken by the Court of Justice on this matter, thereby also ensuring legal certainty. That is our demand and consequently, we have submitted an alternative resolution. We ask our fellow Members to support this alternative resolution. Evelyne Gebhardt,

 Mr President, Commissioner Barnier, Commissioner Dalli, ladies and gentlemen, today we are talking about the internal market, consumer protection and the mobility of people within the European Union. These are the key issues when we are discussing these three instruments and they are what I want to address in particular. Bringing these three topics together provides a very great advantage for us today, because the economy and the rights of consumers and workers are not intrinsically opposed to one another; they need to be brought together. This is something that we need to make progress on for the future. That is why it is good that we are having this joint debate today. In order to make this a reality, we need, above all, to bring three political principles to the fore. Firstly – and Commissioner Barnier put this very well earlier – protectionism, which is still very much in evidence in the national governments of the Member States, needs to be overcome. That is something we need to do in any case and it is on the agenda. The second political principle is that we must guarantee a high level of protection of the rights of both consumers and workers. In other words, the internal market does not mean the abolition of rights and it does not mean deregulation. It means ensuring that we preserve our very high level of common rights in these areas. For this reason, there is one paragraph in Mrs von Thun Und Hohenstein’s report that we do not agree with. This concerns the so-called Internal Market Scoreboard or internal market test. This is the wrong approach. It gives the impression that the only important thing is how the market is functioning. That is not the case. We need to ask what impact the European Union legislation will have on the rights of workers and on the rights of consumers. We therefore reject this concept, because it is the wrong one. Thirdly, we need good enforcement of these rights at European level. For this, we need a system of collective redress so that consumers do not stand alone in this internal market, but are also able to really assert their rights. Evelyne Gebhardt,  
on behalf of the S&amp;D Group.

 Mr President, Commissioner, thank you very much for the information you have given us but, to be honest, I am not entirely satisfied. The previous Commission set itself the quite clear objective of liberalising the gambling market. The European Parliament has made it clear, time and again, that this cannot be the right approach, because it was the European Parliament, rather than Member States, that, for example, removed gambling from the scope of the Services Directive. We took the view that it is not just any other service, that we must ensure that we introduce safeguards which will protect our citizens from organised crime and that we require clear rules to that end. Nonetheless, the European Commission continues to bring Member States before the European Court of Justice, and it is time that the Commission ceased this practice as it keeps losing cases at the Court. You simply have to face this fact. I would, therefore, welcome it, Mr Barnier, if you put what you have just said, that is, that a different approach is needed in this area, into practice because we cannot proceed with things remaining as they are now. In response to your point, Mr Harbour, I would argue that the rulings of the European Court of Justice have been very consistent and not at all contradictory. In its judgments, the Court has stated, time and again, that Member States have the right to introduce clear rules, so that we can truly verify whether or not citizens are protected against crime, and that Member States are not under any obligation to open this market up. Nor are they under any obligation to allow market operators from other Member States to operate on their territory, as long as they make sure that their controls are strong and effective. That is what we want to see from the European Commission, that it has finally grasped this and acted accordingly. However, this also means that we have to pay particular attention to online gambling, because the Internet does not recognise any barriers or borders and, of course, because our citizens have access to gambling sites. We need to think about how we can shape controls and rules in this area, so that our citizens are protected. Evelyne Gebhardt  (S&amp;D

 Mr President, Mr Barroso, we were very happy to have got the Treaty of Lisbon in place on 1 December and, along with that, a stronger social policy and a strengthening of the position of consumers in the area of internal policy within the European Union. However, we now find that you – contrary to what is contained in the Treaty of Lisbon, namely a horizontal commitment to protect consumers – have done exactly the opposite with the division of the portfolios in your European Commission, because now there is not just one commissioner responsible for consumer protection, but several. I would like to ask you how you actually intend to handle this. How do you intend to establish coherence in this policy area, an area that is extremely important to consumers, to European citizens? The responsibilities have been divided up. Which commissioner will provide this coherence? Please do not tell us that it is the College that will decide. We need clear areas of responsibility. Please do not say to us, either, that ultimately you will decide in the event of a dispute between the different commissioners. You are not almighty and you belong to a College. I have serious difficulties with this, Mr Barroso. You need to explain to me how you can truly get to grips with this fragmentation of policy in the area of consumer protection, but also in other areas like foreign policy, so that we have a policy that, after five years, will allow us to say ‘yes, it was worth having a Commission like this’. I do not yet know how I will vote later. That will depend very much on your answers to our questions. Evelyne Gebhardt,

 Mr President, I would first like to say that it is totally outrageous that there are no members of the Commission here, because this is a question directed at the European Commission. This shows contempt for Parliament. It is simply outrageous and we find it totally unacceptable. (Heckling)
 Yes? Yes, he did not get up. Well, I am sorry. I cannot accept that. Moving on to the matter in hand, ladies and gentlemen, this is all about the citizenship of the Union, about the people who have the right to move freely throughout the European Union and to practise their professions where they live and where they choose to work. We have put this legislation in place so that this will become easier and so that the process of recognising professional qualifications can genuinely be brought up to date. I find it simply appalling that the Member States in many cases have not taken the necessary steps to implement this legislation and to ensure that citizens really have this freedom of movement. There is still a great deal to be done by the European Commission in this respect. I would like to draw attention to one point which is very important to me and which we have repeatedly brought up in Parliament. We must ensure that the European professional card, which we have proposed, is introduced. This will put into citizens’ hands something that will allow them to move throughout Europe. There are organisations which are attempting to do this. However, I feel it is important to ask the European Commission whether this is an area in which it could become involved in order to speed this process up. Evelyne Gebhardt,  
on behalf of the S&amp;D Group.

 Mr President, I am grateful that we are able to debate this topic today, as it is such an important one. I would like to make one thing absolutely clear: as Parliament, we have not merely played a part, but we have ensured that, in this Services Directive, a very positive, constructive compromise was found. This compromise is based, in particular, on guaranteeing labour and social rights and on the particular regard for and removal of the services of general economic interest. That was the reason why a Services Directive was possible in the first place. However, there are a few things than I am not sure about in this regard, and the questions that we raised have not been answered. It would, for example, be very disappointing if what I have heard from various sources turned out to be true, namely, that some Member States are using the transposition of the Services Directive to destroy the balance that we, as legislators, have found by not fully respecting the rights of workers as we envisaged in the Services Directive. This relates not only to the working conditions, which are being called into question, but in many Member States, the definitions are also being re-written or made more restrictive. There are also Member States which, with feeble justifications, are not removing the social services from amongst the services to which this transposition relates. In this respect, the European Commission’s Handbook was not very helpful, because the guidelines that it gave were partly wrong and it provided an interpretation that was, in our opinion, incorrect. The examples that I have given show how important it is for us also to create a legal framework for services of general economic interest, so that social rights, such as labour rights, can also be fully and completely respected once again. Anything else would not be sufficient. I would also like to ask the Member States to what extent they have involved the stakeholders and, in particular, the trade unions and the social services, in the transposition. This is a question that we raised, but to which I have not heard an answer, and I would very much like a good answer to this question. Evelyne Gebhardt (S&amp;D).

 Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, one thing needs to be stated very clearly: there is a unified system in China and we do not want to allow this system to break up. We respect the Chinese system. However, that does not mean ... (Interruption by Mr Posselt)
 We respect China’s unified system. However, that does not mean that the diversity of peoples in China must not also be respected. That is what we Social Democrats are calling for. We want citizens’ rights, human rights and people’s freedom to be respected in China. We want freedom of expression to be respected. We want journalists to be able to move around freely so that the situation as it really is can indeed be reported. That is what we want and there is one thing that we would say very clearly to our colleagues in China: what for us is a basic principle we would also expect to be a basic principle for you in China, namely that human rights are universal. What the politicians always say to us – let us first solve the social problems and then we can talk about human rights – is the wrong way to go about things. It must be the other way round. Human rights come first and then social rights, which are quite simply part and parcel of human rights and cannot be separated from them. I was therefore very disappointed by what you said, Mr Bildt. You seemed to be saying: let us work together on an economic level, that is our main concern and all of the other things are of no particular interest to us. That is not the approach that we need. We need to take the approach presented to us by the European Commission, namely to say that we first want a common basis for our work on which we can then build our cooperation, because we do want cooperation, that much is clear, but not on any basis, only on a correct basis that respects human dignity.

Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, the need for European solutions and European emergency plans is nowhere more obvious than in the case of European rivers, since they connect European countries. A bad example of this is the catastrophe two years ago when contaminated sludge from a Hungarian aluminium factory flowed into the Danube. It became obvious in that case how important cooperation is. Furthermore, seamless transport connections are especially important. As co-rapporteur of the report on the development of the trans-European transport network, I consider inland navigation as an important means of transport, because it is environmentally friendly and still has potential for growth. At the same time, we must also comply with emissions targets. We cannot expand at any cost. This means that we must place ecological considerations and environmental protection in the foreground and at the heart of this process.  We have heard today that one of the last free-flowing sections of the Danube between Straubing and Vilshofen is this kind of bad example. In my view, the environment must take precedence here. In the meantime, the CSU environment minister in the government of the state of Bavaria has recognised this. Now he has to convince his Bavarian Prime Minister and the Federal Transport Minister that any investment in further studies is unnecessary and that any investment – I refer here to the EUR 16.5 million which the Commission has also invested in this study – is, unfortunately, money spent in vain. It would be better spent – as Mr Theurer has mentioned – in the Danube Youth Foundation. This is the direction we need to take in future.

Mr President, Ms Lochbihler, thank you for your question. There is actually a certain contradiction in the Danube region strategy: on the one hand is the objective of environmental protection and on the other hand is the objective of supporting those who want to destroy the Danube. I will say quite clearly: it must not be a question of mobility at any price. The ships that travel on rivers must adapt to the rivers, not vice versa. If we give both these objectives equal importance, I can see how we can achieve both goals. Ecological considerations are at least as important as economic components. Ismail Ertug  (S&amp;D

Mr President, Mr President-in-Office of the Council, I would like to congratulate you on taking over the presidency and wish you every success in the job you have to do in these difficult times. You will need to be fully committed, Mr Christofias, when it comes to stimulating growth and creating jobs in the European Union. We are very interested in the specific solutions that you propose for combating youth unemployment You will have the support of Parliament if you take on this problem. The negotiations on the multiannual financial framework naturally have a high priority. You have rightly recognised, and I congratulate you on this, that the financing of the Trans-European Networks will bring significant added value to Europe. I would like to call on you to make a strong commitment to push through in the Council the approach to financing called for by the Commission. Your country will benefit from this, Mr Christofias. For example, the port of Limassol is part of the core transport network, as is Larnaka airport and the road project linking Limassol and Nicosia, which could receive European funding. When we talk about Cyprus, we are, of course, also referring to an unresolved problem which has already been mentioned several times today. Mr Christofias, what sort of scenario should the European Union expect if there is no solution for Cyprus, which after 38 years of unsuccessful negotiations seems more likely than ever?

 Mr President, rapporteur, ladies and gentlemen, I think it is clear that the European Union’s aim is to ensure a better common railways policy. This legislation helps bring that about. In this respect, it will help, for instance, by opening up basic services for the market, which is a beneficial thing to do. I would also like to offer the rapporteur specific thanks for also having stuck to the multiannual financial plans between infrastructure operators and the Member States, as doing so facilitates long-term planning in respect of funding, which provides a certain degree of planning certainty and, above all, it will have a positive impact on the development of the European railway market. We have heard a number of times today already that the most important element in this legislation will be organising the national regulatory bodies as they actually should be organised, which is to say, with more powers and such that they are not as weak as they are in many Member States of the Union. The situation today is that we have regulatory authorities that are unable to make it possible for other competitors to enter the market, and this means that market access is made more difficult. Under this legislation, such unfair practice will, first of all, be monitored and then it will also be eliminated and made possible for punishment to be imposed. My final point concerns what I would definitely consider a step in the right direction, by which, of course, I mean transparency in the financial flows. In this respect, it needs to be very clearly emphasised that this obviously must not pave the way for the pre-emption of the separation of networks and operators, as that would be too serious an intrusion into national subsidiarity rights. We should therefore leave it at that. I would like to offer my sincere thanks to the rapporteur once again, and especially also to the shadow rapporteurs, for the fact that we have produced such sound legislation. Ismail Ertug  (S&amp;D

 Mr President, first of all, let me add my voice to those thanking the rapporteur for her outstanding work, as well as the shadow rapporteurs, of course. This was a tough job, we are well aware of that. It has always been Parliament’s aim to ensure increased road safety. With various laws, this venerable House has helped to also bring that about. I would remind everyone at this juncture, just by way of example, about the issues of overtiredness behind the wheel and the fight against the exploitation of workers. Irrespective of this, it is, of course, important to constantly adapt to technical changes, technical developments. On that basis, we must continue to prevent manipulation of the devices in future, too, clearly while adhering to strict data protection provisions. Another point that is very important to me and which is achieved by means of this document is the harmonisation of the specific measures for the training of control officers and, very interestingly and importantly, the approximation of penalties. When it comes to the derogation, I would insist that this 150 kilometre stipulation for handicraft businesses be maintained, as this is important for the business of these companies.

The Tymoshenko case and political developments in Ukraine in general indicate that democracy and the rule of law still remain values that cannot be taken for granted in today’s Europe and for which we must actively campaign. The thirst for reform seemed enormous in Ukraine in the period following the Orange Revolution and the country quickly became a perfect example of the success of European neighbourhood policy. In this context I find it extremely regrettable that political life in Ukraine is once again characterised by political trials, political meddling in the administration of justice and state interference. The response of the European Commission and a number of Member States to the latest events is decisive but by no means excessive. The absence of the most senior Members of the Commission from the European Championship in Ukraine sets down a clear marker, but should not divert attention from the problems in the country and the possible solutions. For this reason I welcome your intention, Mr Füle, to continue with the association process with Ukraine if there are positive developments and, above all, if free and fair elections are held this autumn. In order to be able to provide positive support for developments in Ukraine in future, European neighbourhood policy must also incorporate the wishes and expectations of the people of Ukraine. Before we intensify our partnership, however, Yulia Tymoshenko must be given fair treatment. Naturally this must take her health into consideration and must be free from all state interference.

 The resolution before us sends out a clear signal and supports the conviction that the social democrats have had for a long time that the crisis can only be overcome if the financial sector is put in its place. To avoid the excesses of the banks in 2008 from being repeated in the future, we need to rigorously pursue two goals. Firstly, ladies and gentlemen, it must not be possible for banks to operate in such a short-sighted and reckless manner in the future. Secondly, we must invest more in the real economy in order to stem the power of the financial sector in today’s economy. Both of these things can be achieved by the planned tax. Even the extremely low tax rates of 0.01% and 0.1% would provide the Member States with additional resources of up to EUR 100 billion. That EUR 100 billion could relieve the burden on severely stretched budgets and be used to invest in lasting growth. I am confident that you will all use your votes to give this proposal the necessary emphasis, and I call on all the Member States not to block the Commission’s proposal in the Council. However, should such a common EU-wide solution fail due to a handful of naysayers, then the remaining Member States must set a good example by pushing ahead via the process of enhanced cooperation.

 Mr President, Mr Kallas, as competition increases in the years to come, we can expect the volume of traffic to increase even further. If we look at the figures again, it becomes clear that more than a quarter of our current CO2
 emissions are produced by transport. This means that we must reduce our CO2
 emissions and increase the efficiency of our transport systems. In my opinion, you have taken the right approach in your document. Your proposal for new guidelines is primarily about giving priority to environmentally friendly means of transport. However, now we come to the ‘but’, Mr Kallas. This makes it all the more incomprehensible to me that you have seriously considered permitting cross-border transport on Europe’s roads using so-called monster trucks or gigaliners. I would be grateful if you could explain to us why you are considering this, without waiting for the analyses on road safety and the environment, and how you plan to proceed in future. You know that this is a very sensitive subject and that we are opposed to these trucks. Ismail Ertug  (S&amp;D
).

Mr President, Mr Kallas, does this mean that the current interpretation of the law, which states that cross-border journeys by these gigaliners are banned, continues to apply, or is this interpretation no longer valid? Ismail Ertug  (S&amp;D

 All of us have painful memories of the images of the burning Deepwater Horizon oil platform in the spring of 2010. Outdated technology and the conscious acceptance of safety risks led to the two-month long outflow of incredible quantities of crude oil. As we all know, the consequences for people and the environment were disastrous. The fact that there is a danger of the same thing happening at the 450 drilling rigs in the North Sea, for example, was demonstrated in August of this year by the oil leak in the Gannet Alpha pipelines off the Scottish coast. I therefore welcome the proposal put before us to extend the areas of competence of the European Maritime Safety Agency in this regard, so that in future, safety inspections can also be carried out on oil drilling rigs. EMSA has already proven its ability to act in connection with past tanker disasters. On the basis of this experience, I believe that the proposed extension of the areas of competence is preferable to the creation of a new agency. In addition, this kind of European solution to maritime safety problems is preferable to having national supervisory authorities. The faster lines of communication and the cross-border consequences of incidents such as oil disasters can only be tackled at European level. Finally, I would like to thank Mr Fleckenstein for his excellent work as rapporteur and I call on all my fellow Members to support this important dossier. Ismail Ertug  (S&amp;D

 Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, the White Paper on transport was proposed by the Commission in order to set European transport policy goals for the next 20 or 40 years. I know that 40 years is perhaps a very extensive period. However, we must nevertheless bear in mind that transport projects require lengthy planning phases. I therefore support the long-term approach taken by the Commission. Let us take a look at the ambitious goals of the Commission, which I support: increased safety through the use of intelligent transport technologies, improved traffic routing using multimodal solutions, the internalisation of external costs and, above all, transport must become even more environmentally friendly. There are some good approaches and, in this regard, I would refer to the legislative proposals for environmentally friendly urban transport up to 2015. While we are on the subject of environmental protection, I would once again like to point out that it is extremely important to reduce greenhouse gas emissions still further. As regards the development of inland waterways, I would also like to take this opportunity to mention once again the planned development of the Danube. In this regard, we must ensure that this does not ultimately damage the natural environment. I would like to quote Mr Cramer here, who quite rightly always says that ships must be adapted to the river and not the other way around. I am pleased to see that good amendments were tabled in this regard. I would like to thank the rapporteur once again for being so ready to compromise. Finally, I would like to mention one more thing: I would have liked us to have implemented the 300 km approach in connection with the shifting of goods transport from the roads onto the railways. However, I would essentially like to say thank you very much and I hope this will be successful. Ismail Ertug  (S&amp;D

Madam President, Mr Koumoutsakos, ladies and gentlemen, the report on the Commission’s proposal for a programme to support the further development of an integrated maritime policy is one way to achieve the objectives of the Treaty of Lisbon and to increase coherence between the various policy areas. It is a welcome development that solutions have been sought on a cross-departmental basis in maritime policy and that an attempt has also been made to create synergies. Maritime policy goes beyond marine transport and fishing. Industry, research and alternative power generation, as well as environmental protection, are areas that are inseparably associated with the classic aspects of maritime policy. For this reason, there is a need for improved coordination between policy areas and between Member States with access to the sea. The report has improved on the Commission’s proposal on several counts. In this context, I expressly welcome the fact that more attention has been paid to environmental protection, the protection of species and the sustainable use of maritime resources, an aspect which, I must say, could have been given even more prominence in the Commission’s proposal. Mr Koumoutsakos, I hope that you receive a broad negotiating mandate for your report and would also like to thank Mr Milana for his work and wish you all the best for the future.

 Madam President, Ms Serracchiani, ladies and gentlemen, this proposal takes us one step closer to a simpler, more effective joint rail policy. The significantly strengthened regulatory body and financial plans spanning several years will help make rail travel more competitive and reliable. I am also particularly pleased that the rapporteur has succeeded in including social aspects in the focus of the report. After all, an integrated rail market must offer employees the same high-standard working conditions throughout the European Union. In this context, it is correct that the right to strike should remain inviolable. Opinion has been divided for some time in relation to the separation of the rail network and the operating companies and I would like expressly to thank the rapporteur for her tenacity and willingness to negotiate, because this has helped us find a well-balanced compromise. We now await the legislative proposal from the European Commission. Finally, I would ask and encourage you all to give our rapporteur broad support with a mandate that will enable her to enter into discussions and negotiations with the Council. A solid path has been laid. With this in mind, I would like to thank the rapporteur and wish her well. Ismail Ertug  (S&amp;D

 The road safety measures called for in the report are practical and ambitious. That is the only way that we can reduce the number of accidents on Europe’s roads in future. With the call for a stringent alcohol ban for newly qualified drivers and professional drivers and the call for a ‘vision zero’, Parliament can send out a clear message that road safety has top political priority and road deaths are simply not morally acceptable. If the Commission and the Council get behind the measures that we have proposed, we can at last actually begin to work towards such ambitious objectives. Ismail Ertug  (S&amp;D

 Poland joined the EU seven years and two months ago and we are pleased to see it take over the Presidency of the Council of the European Union. Poland is putting its hand to the tiller at a time when Europe is facing great challenges in terms of its finances, energy policy and internal politics. We therefore doubly welcome the fact that Poland also intends pursuing ambitious goals in transport policy. We Social Democrats welcome the fact that you intend to promote the improvement of social conditions for workers in the transport sector. By taking up the expansion of the Trans-European Transport Networks, you are not only planning to keep in view economic and territorial cohesion, but also the social cohesion of the various regions of the EU. As an advocate of sustainable transport policy, I am particularly pleased that your priorities are in line with those of the White Paper on Transport and that you are anxious to work with Parliament to find a speedy solution for the new version of the first railway package. With this in mind, we look forward to positive collaboration. Ismail Ertug  (S&amp;D

 For me, one particularly important issue with regard to security scanners is that the machines which are available must meet the necessary technical requirements, so that they do not slow down the operational processes and, therefore, lead to undesirable results. The main problems in my view are a reduction in passenger comfort and the introduction of complex processes which ultimately do not bring any increase in security. Unfortunately, past experience indicates that difficulties of this kind may occur. It is important to make the deadline for introducing the new systems dependent on the technology being fully functioning rather than on a specified date. In addition, it must be possible to combine the new machines with systems for detecting liquids. I would also like to highlight the fact that issues of space and structural engineering need to be taken into consideration in the case of the control unit (in other words, the security scanner and the X-ray device). Major structural alterations will be needed at many airports to support the weight of the machine and to make the necessary space available. The throughput rate for passengers must be equivalent to the existing figures at the passenger checkpoints. Otherwise there will be significant operational and quality problems. It is essential that the airports are able to put realistic plans in place. We must not forget that the necessary facilities must be made available, including space for the machines, structural engineering work and training measures, and that comprehensive plans are needed which cover the time and funding needed for the alterations to the buildings.

− (DE) My aim is still to achieve a uniform ban on genetically modified organisms (GMOs) in all Member States. We cannot tell what impact GMOs will have on our health, because the technology is still too new. The fundamental problem is that it has spread so rapidly. Having once introduced the technology, it is now impossible to get rid of it. Therefore, I welcome the fact that we are adopting a report today which makes a ban on GMOs possible and which strengthens consumers’ rights. Once again we are reinforcing consumers’ rights more effectively than the Member States have done. The European Parliament was responsible for introducing the mandatory labelling of GMOs last year, not the Council of Ministers. This report makes it possible for Member States to impose a ban on GMOs, because of the fear of pesticide resistance, for example. The fact that the World Trade Organisation (WTO) does not feel that concerns about the health of the population are sufficient grounds for a ban causes me to have very serious doubts about the WTO.

Madam President, as you said, Mr Kallas, the gigaliners or monster trucks or whatever you want to call them are a controversial subject. You mentioned efficiency gains in terms of fuel consumption. I would like to know what exactly these efficiency gains are. I know that those in favour of these trucks say that you can make one truck out of two. This would ultimately result in warehousing as we know it today becoming less expensive and it would be cheaper to drive goods around on the streets than to store them in warehouses, with the result that making one truck out of two would actually have exactly the opposite effect. I would like to ask you to consider this, because it would mean that we would have more trucks on the roads than we did before. You have announced various studies on the subject of the monster trucks. What is happening with them? What results have you so far received? What are the next steps to be taken? I would be interested in knowing more, because Germany does not have a uniform approach to these trucks and most people are opposed to them. Ismail Ertug  (S&amp;D

Mr President, Commissioner, President-in-Office of the Council, ladies and gentlemen, over 31 000 people a year are still dying on European roads. That being so, I find it negligent, to say the least, that the Member States’ transport ministers have blocked such an important instrument in the Council for over two years. As representatives of the people, you should be keen, for the safety of your citizens, to ensure that drivers from non-Member States cannot disregard traffic rules with impunity. The fact that we shall be voting on this proposal tomorrow is due, above all, to our rapporteur’s persistence. Like her, I too am disappointed that the Council has changed the legal basis for this directive, thereby provoking an opt-out by three Member States. This will create a law for EU-wide prosecution of traffic offences that will not be applied throughout the EU and I consider this less than perfect, to put it mildly. This disappointment notwithstanding, it is another important step towards closer cooperation in the road traffic sector and I should like to ask you all to vote in favour of this compromise tomorrow. I should like to point out once again that the rapporteur campaigned extremely hard for a strong review clause and to thank her for that; I hope that, when the review comes around within the next five years, the transport ministers will be not only older, but also wiser.

 We in the Group of the Progressive Alliance of Socialists and Democrats in the European Parliament have worked hard to ensure that the new EU agricultural policy is oriented towards ecological standards. In our view, farmers must be rewarded for providing services to society. That is exactly what they do, and nothing could be rewarded less in the prices currently being achieved at market. Retaining the two-pillar model guarantees that farmers will continue to receive a fixed amount in the future that they can rely on. These payments are important for long-term planning. By linking the direct payment to an economic variable we can achieve the transition from a Europe of 15 Member States to a Europe of 27 without offending anyone too much. The report is a good compromise; it is a European compromise. The question now is what the Commission, and particularly President Barroso, will make of it. Cutting the funding for environmental protection in particular suggests narrow-mindedness, and I hope Commissioner Cioloş will be able to talk him out of it. Ismail Ertug,

 Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, following a negotiations marathon, Mr El Khadraoui and the representatives of the Council and the Commission managed to tie up an improved package of measures for road charging for heavy goods vehicles in Europe. I am very grateful to those involved and, in particular, to our rapporteur, for what they have achieved. Through the recognition of the principle of internalising external costs, the partial earmarking of funding for the transport infrastructure and the incentives provided for fleet renewal, we have succeeded in realising important objectives from the Transport White Paper. I also believe that we must not overlook the obligations for transparency, which ultimately must also apply to the Council. I find it highly regrettable that several Member States attempted, even after the conclusion of the trialogue negotiations, to throw a spanner in the works – they really did try – in connection with the correlation tables in order to block this directive. Nonetheless, I would like to conclude by calling on all my fellow Members to accept the compromise achieved and not to jeopardise the results of these long and laboured negotiations, as all that would achieve would be to help the wrong people. You have my thanks for backing this compromise. Ismail Ertug  (S&amp;D

 We are absorbing antibiotics in our food, which is resulting in increased resistance. This is one area of medical progress which is gradually being ruined and we have known about this for a long time. Mr De Castro referred to the measures that have already been taken. I support the proposals made in the resolution. There are two aspects of this which I would like to focus on. Regulations alone are not enough. In the dioxin scandal, we have seen how easily they can be undermined, if individual ‘black sheep’ behave in a very negligent way. Of course, we must have regulations and we need to introduce monitoring systems, but that is not the entire solution. In the medium and long term, the solution is to make the use of antibiotics largely superfluous. We can achieve this firstly by investing in research and networking expert knowledge, secondly, by passing this knowledge on to farmers and vets and thirdly, by providing information to consumers. We must make clever use of market forces, because it is consumers who decide in the long term how their food is produced. Ismail Ertug  (S&amp;D

 Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, the volcanic ash of last year showed us in an impressive way where our weaknesses lie. The question therefore arises as to how we should deal with such situations in the future. It is, of course, first and foremost a question of the safety of those people who board an aeroplane. Of course, we must also keep in mind how we intend to deal with the financial losses. My question to the Commission is therefore – Mr Hahn, perhaps you could also pass this on to Mr Kallas – what, in specific terms, are we planning? I would argue that it is particularly important for us to take over the coordination when it comes to test flights and limit values. That is very important in order for us to know which aeroplanes can take off and when. I have another comment, Commissioner: it is extremely important – and this has already been referred to many times – to establish the Single European Sky. What does the Commission intend to do in terms of exerting pressure on the Member States to actually fulfil their obligation in this regard? After all, they have put their signatures to it. Another important point, which has already been made several times today, is what happens now with regard to passengers’ rights in air transport. We have Regulation (EC) No 2061 from 2004. What does the Commission intend to do in this regard? We are aware of the problem of the financial losses suffered by the various airlines. I would also like to point out once again that we need alternatives to air transport, and by that I mean the rail system. I am also one of those who believe that we must link the large cities – Europe’s capital cities – together. In this case, too, the answer is that we need more involvement from Europe, not less. I would be pleased if the Commission would give its attention to these issues. Ismail Ertug  (S&amp;D

Madam President, Mr President-in-Office of the Council, Mr Füle, I would like to wish you every success with your work in future. It is hard to ignore the ambivalence of the Cyprus issue. We in the European Union must not dismiss apparently unpleasant issues or try to pretend that they do not exist. We have not kept our promise. That is a fact and we must resolve these double standards. We know that the Ankara Protocol must definitely be implemented with regard to the Cyprus question. However, it is also clear, as stated by the Council in 2004, that the isolation of Northern Cyprus must come to an end. I am pleased that Southern Cyprus is providing the north with the necessary support, but this was not the intention of the European Union. Its intention was that everyone, the entire EU, should bring an end to the isolation. In order to overcome the final obstacle in this area, we must take a step forwards and put a stop to this isolation. Ismail Ertug  (S&amp;D

 Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, Turkey is, of course, an emotional topic, that is quite clear. There is one thing that we should, of course, always take into account in this context, and this has been mentioned several times today, namely that, although the prohibition of the party is totally unacceptable, it was not pronounced by the government, but by the judicial system. We need to draw a distinction here in order to be fair and honest. However, that was not what I wanted to say. As Europeans, we must ask ourselves where we actually want to go. If, as a global player, we want to pass on not only economic – and as a Social Democrat I would like to emphasise this – but also political values, not only in Europe but also beyond European borders out into the world, then for this, ultimately, we need Turkey. It will also give us the opportunity to be firm and clear in our dealings with Turkey, which is exactly what is required. Only then will we succeed in setting a democratisation process in motion in order to succeed in our overall purpose. Jens Geier,

Madam President, President Caldeira, Commissioner Šemeta, ladies and gentlemen, I would like to begin by thanking the Court of Auditors for presenting this annual report, our most important tool in the discharge procedure for the Commission’s budget. My sincere thanks for this transparent report, which I believe will do much to help us more forward.  This report makes it clear that for the 18th
 time in succession, there can only be a limited statement of assurance for the work of the Commission, and as Mr Pieper has already said, the trend towards an improving error rate year on year has stopped. This House abides by its demand, however: what we want to see is a clear trend towards an improving error rate in the implementation of the EU budget. We are not prepared to accept the present situation. The Court of Auditors’ annual report also sends out a clear message to the Council, however, which is meeting this evening in order to find a compromise for the multiannual financial framework. Poorly functioning management and control systems in the Member States, overdue financial corrections at a high level, unnecessarily complicated rules in the Member States: anyone who wants better spending and does not use this as camouflage for cuts can start here. Anyone who wants better spending must improve the controls in the Member States, not cut the budgets. Anyone who wants better spending must also do their homework in their own country, for in Germany, the Netherlands and the United Kingdom, the control systems, according to the Court of Auditors and the Commission, are only effective to a limited extent. What concerns us about budget management in 2011 is that in some areas of the budget, the figures have got worse, as Mr Pieper has already pointed out. In research policy, for example – an area of the budget that is, in fact, directly administered by the Commission – the error rate has doubled from 1.4 to 3 %. Here, we must demand a plan of action from the Commissioner for Research, setting out how the Commission intends to reduce these error rates. In the common agricultural policy, the error rate generally hovered around the materiality threshold of 2 %. Now, the Court of Auditors estimates the error rate in rural development to be an incredible 7.7 %, meaning that spending on rural development has by far the highest error rate of any area investigated.  We cannot be consoled by the explanation that the programmes in the Member States have now reached full maturity, or by the explanation that the number of development projects is also increasing, so the errors are rising as well. No, what we want to see here is a remedy, and the Directorate-General for Agriculture and Rural Development and Commissioner Cioloş should be resolute in their efforts to move Member States towards better controls, as has already been achieved in regional policy. This is a good example of how tackling the causes can have a positive effect. The figure of 6 % for erroneous payments as a proportion of the total is still too high but the trend is moving in the right direction. The action plan adopted in 2008 has done much to improve the situation by greatly increasing the Commission’s supervision of the national management and control systems. Commissioner Cioloş should therefore start by seeking ideas for his own action plan to reduce the growing error rates in agricultural policy as well. There is room for improvement in regional policy too. We want retrospective projects to be removed from funding at last. We want the Directorate-General for Regional Policy to take the same robust action as the Directorate-General for Employment by suspending and cancelling funding programmes if Member States cannot guarantee proper and lawful control, and we want net corrections: Member States should only be able to transfer funds to other projects if they themselves detect errors in project management. If they are unable to detect the errors themselves, as is so often the case, the funding should revert to the Commission. Jens Geier,  
deputising for the rapporteur.

 Madam President, I am standing in, today, for Ms Ayala Sender, who is in Algeria as part of an electoral observers’ delegation and is thus unable to act as rapporteur for discharge of the other institutions. Let me start with the good news: we intend to move that the majority of the other institutions should be discharged. We had difficulty with the granting of discharge to the Economic and Social Committee because, although various requirements of the European Parliament in relation to questions of travel expenses claims and similar problems that attract a great deal of interest in the media have been met, we are somewhat concerned to find that there have been some differences of opinion within the Committee in relation to certain decisions on appointments – I trust you will understand my wish to choose my words with care here. The rapporteur has expressed her concerns in relation to this issue at Committee level and we shall continue to monitor the situation. However, this will not prevent us from requesting discharge. In the case of the Council, the situation is slightly different. Firstly, I would like to express my satisfaction and pleasure to find that the Danish Council Presidency is doing us the honour of following this debate. This is a first in all my time as a Member of his House. This is an encouraging sign that we are moving away from the phase where the institutions simply ignored one another during debates. I will return to this point at the end of my remarks. Each year, we find ourselves in a situation reminiscent of ‘Groundhog Day’. In other words, we start the business of discharging the Council for its management of the budget, or at least for the portion that involves European Union resources – in other words, the general budget funds. We assess the documents and we ask pertinent questions. The Council never gives any answers, however. Instead, we have received an offer from the Council to negotiate an interinstitutional agreement. This is something to be welcomed from my point of view at least because I have a difficulty when I find the Secretaries-General of the two institutions negotiating with one another, despite the fact that they do not have a political mandate – please do not take this personally Mr Welle – because, in my opinion, they have failed to pay enough attention to the aspirations, wishes and positions of the responsible Committee. Thus, we have a proposal for an interinstitutional agreement on the table and the position of my group in this House is that we should put the opportunities offered by this interinstitutional agreement to the test. Unfortunately we are in the minority here, because most of my fellow Members believe that the documents describe the functions adequately. At this point, I would like to emphasise once again that the Group of the Progressive Alliance of Socialists and Democrats does not wish to reduce the rights and responsibilities of the discharge authority, but that it would like to see how far we can get with the Council if we follow the strategy of negotiating this interinstitutional agreement. The main problem is reciprocity, as the Council insists that it should be allowed to examine Parliament’s auditing process, adopting the same high-handed approach as it takes to answering our questions to the Council. One more thing, Madam President; the bottom line for Parliament is that we cannot accept a situation where civil servants from the Member States control the public representatives who express the will of the citizens of Europe. Everything else is open to negotiation, so perhaps we shall succeed in making a little progress today. Jens Geier  (S&amp;D

Madam President, Ms Andreasen has just asked the European taxpayer to stop paying money to Brussels because, supposedly, no one is interested in spending practices. Exactly the opposite is true. This House is extremely interested in the spending practices of the EU institutions and what happens with the European taxpayers’ money. The problem is that our conclusions are different from those of Ms Andreasen. The Group of the Progressive Alliance of Socialists and Democrats certainly comes to very different conclusions in relation to the situation of the European agencies. Let me give you a brief run-down based on the example of the European Medicines Agency (EMA). Thanks to the work of our rapporteur of last year, Mr Stavrakakis, the EMA now has the strictest ‘Conflict of interest’
 system in Europe. The rapporteur for the European People's Party (Christian Democrats) has come to the conclusion that this is not enough and suggests that the discharge should be deferred, arguing that this system must first prove itself. This is precisely the opposite of the burden of proof outlined by Ms Herczog in her contribution. Ms Macovei, if the effectiveness of this system is to be put to the test, then this is the job of the next rapporteur, Mr Gerbrandy from the Group of the Alliance of Liberals and Democrats for Europe. If we find that the system does not work, then we can fine-tune it. However, to insist that an agency should not be discharged until the system has proven itself is to turn the burden of proof on its head. At this point, I fail to understand your claim that you are not seeking to damage the agency. The damage has already been done. We simply need to take a look at how the media has reported on your report, questioning the independence of stakeholders or experts in the agencies. You have already inflicted the damage that you say you wanted to avoid. We do indeed have a problem. The problem is that we cannot find independent rapporteurs or experts because you will find it difficult to identify university lecturers who have not worked for industry in the past. It is also the function of the agencies to cooperate with the private sector. Perhaps we really do need absolute clarity in declarations, separation of responsibilities and regulations. This cannot be achieved by deferring the discharge, however, Ms Macovei. For this reason, we will not be supporting your report. Jens Geier  (S&amp;D

 Mr Bradbourn, I share many of the opinions you have expressed. I have one question for you, however, in light of the judgment of the European Court of Auditors that the United Kingdom is responsible for 10% of the errors in cohesion policy: what is the Conservative Party of Great Britain doing to eliminate this mismanagement by British administrative authorities? Jens Geier,  
rapporteur.
 – (DE)
 Mr President, Mr Ehrenhauser, that fits in very nicely inasmuch as I can answer your question straight away. It is quite clear to me that, at this juncture, it is not a question of refusing discharge. However, if the rapporteur for the discharge in respect of the agencies raises accusations against the agencies, some of which lie outside the responsibility of these institutions, because the staffing of certain bodies, which you rightly described as excessive, is the responsibility of the Member States, then in October, the only option will be to refuse discharge, because this situation will not have changed, because the Member States will not have altered their behaviour with regard to the agencies. Therefore, the political instrument is not the appropriate one. The Group of the Progressive Alliance of Socialists and Democrats in the European Parliament really is now the last not to take the conflicts of interest seriously. The case just mentioned by Commissioner Šemeta is one that once again throws some pertinent light on the situation. However, the problem will not be resolved by postponing discharge. In committee, I have repeatedly argued that, to resolve the issue, we must wait for the report from the European Court of Auditors, which President Caldeira has, thankfully, informed us about, in order to reach conclusions based on a more thorough knowledge of the facts, which we can then also discuss in a serious debate. I am on the point of making accusations about certain situations, such as the issue that you also mentioned concerning the choice of seats of the agencies. In a press statement, I myself have criticised the fact that the UK Government is forcing one agency to establish its offices in Canary Wharf. That is the most expensive property market that the European Union has to offer. This is the same government that is proposing that the EU make savings. It really must start with its own decisions. Thus, with regard to the question of whether the criticism is justified, there is far less disagreement than there perhaps appears to be. The arguments relate to the question of what the political response to this should be. Jens Geier,

 Madam President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, are there 111 774 or 125 218 officers serving in Afghanistan’s national police force? This question remains to be answered. That is one of the problems that we encounter when we examine the issue of the use of EU aid in Afghanistan. This question is not inconsequential, as the salaries of the Afghan police officers are paid through the Law and Order Trust Fund for Afghanistan (LOTFA), which was set up by the United Nations Development Programme. LOTFA is the largest recipient of financial aid in Afghanistan. We do not know how many police officers there are because the databases of the Afghan police force are unreliable. Up to now, the European Union has provided funds to Afghanistan via three different channels. There is the use of private contracting partners which fulfil contracts issued by the European Commission. There are non-governmental organisations and there are the multi-donor trust funds, the largest being maintained by the United Nations, and there is another important one that was set up by the World Bank for the development of Afghanistan. These are the channels through which the European Union’s projects in Afghanistan, which must meet a number of criteria, are financed. They are to ensure the visibility of the European Union in Afghanistan. They are to support capacity building in the public administration. They must not be vulnerable to corruption. They must be sustainable. They are to be aligned with the regional priorities, but also with the priorities of the government. If we examine the strengths and weaknesses of the channels through which we transfer funds to Afghanistan, then we see that not all of the criteria can be met via any one channel, but that each of the different channels that the European Union uses to transfer funds to Afghanistan has its own particular strengths, but also its own particular risks. Two of the important objectives, namely, capacity building in the public administration and alignment with the priorities of the government, cannot be met at all via the channels used up to now. In my report, I therefore propose that we use a fourth channel, one that is now used for Afghanistan by many donors in the international community although not as yet by the European Union, and that is the channel of direct budget support to the Afghan state. This direct support to the Afghan budget brings with it a number of problems. One of these became very clear in media reports when it was found that cash – dollars in this case – was immediately being taken out of Afghanistan by the box-load, and I am pleased to be able to say at this point that, if these boxes contained any European funds at all, it would have only been a very small amount. With their direct budget support, the Americans had to learn a very expensive lesson in using this channel. However, they have learnt that lesson. They are proceeding step by step. They are taking it department by department of the Afghan ministries and ensuring that certain criteria are met, namely, that management and control systems are employed, that there are mechanisms for combating corruption in place, and that accountability to the Afghan Parliament is ensured. I believe that if the European Commission were to follow the same path, that is to say, take a step-wise approach, set clear goals for the Afghan Government that are retrievable and possible to monitor, ensure that there is accountability to the Afghan Parliament and – I believe this is very important – a truly independent Afghan court of auditors, then we can also support the use of this channel. After the withdrawal of the military, there will be a greater need for civilian aid. We must therefore ensure that this aid functions in a targeted, effective and sustainable way and that the funds provided by the European Union are protected against corruption and waste. That is in the best interests not only of European taxpayers, but of Afghanistan, too. Jens Geier,

 Mr President, Mr Caldeira, Mr Šemeta, ladies and gentlemen, the overall error rate for spending from the EU budget was 3.7%. This figure is too high. A resolution by this House based on the Liberadzki report calls for this figure to be constantly reduced. I am concerned that the Court of Auditors’ annual report for the financial year 2010 shows that the trend is being reversed. After three years of falling error rates, the figure is now increasing again. Unfortunately, European regional policy is once again responsible, because the error rate in this area rose from 5.5 to 7.7%. Interestingly, information from the European Commission shows that the United Kingdom is in third place behind Spain and Italy in the list of states where the most errors take place. We know that errors are being made because of divided management in the Member States and we know which Member States are responsible. Therefore, we are calling on the Commission to focus on monitoring activities in these countries. The Commission must suspend or interrupt the programmes, but the error rate must come down. If we look at revenue, it is clear that one eighth of the European budget is made up of income from external tariffs. The Member States are also failing to fulfil their obligations in this area. Duties are not being levied efficiently and once again Italy and the United Kingdom, together with the Netherlands, are the main culprits. I would like to thank the European Court of Auditors, you, Mr Caldeira and all your staff for this important document, which we will make detailed use of in the forthcoming discharge procedure.

 Mr President, President-in-Office of the Council, Commissioner Lewandowski, ladies and gentlemen, it is of course also appropriate at this point for we shadow rapporteurs to express our thanks and appreciation to the two rapporteurs from this House. They delved so deeply into the subject that sometimes we could no longer see them. My compliments on this splendid work. In connection with the Financial Regulation, we are also discussing Article 56, which deals with shared management. In the European Union, that is particularly important in regional policy and represents the second largest budget area. It represents the acid test for whether the Member States really are serious about the prudent use of EU funds, about which we have heard so much in the budget debates this morning. We see that, since 1994, there has been a total of more than EUR 7 billion in financial corrections in this area. We also see that, in 2010 alone, there was more than EUR 250 million in repayments to the EU budget – funds that were misspent in the Member States. At this point, I would like once again to recall the fact that EUR 250 million is more than the European Parliament wants to mobilise by means of the Flexibility Instrument. All I can say, Mr Dominik, is that when you next visit in the Council, please convey a message from the Committee on Budgets: we want our money back! What has been proposed in terms of audits and better control procedures in the Financial Regulation within the framework of Article 56 will help in this regard. I will be interested to see how the Council responds to this. Jens Geier,  
on behalf of the S&amp;D Group.

 Madam President, Mr Dominik, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, the question of discharge for the Council has been an institutional bone of contention between Parliament and the Council for years. According to our interpretation, the process is governed by Article 319 of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union, which governs the discharge of the Commission’s budget, and the corresponding article in the Financial Regulation. So far, the Council has not been in agreement with this view. It presently argues that, as it uses operational funding from the Commission’s budget, it is also discharged along with the Commission’s budget. I do not wish to repeat the statements and positions that I and the other members of the Committee on Budgetary Control have heard from the Council in this connection. All I would say is that there have been many of them and, in my view, they have not always been coherent. I think it is an important development that the Council is now ready to negotiate at a political level, rather than at the level of the Secretaries-General – who I do not believe have sufficient political mandate for this – as it informed us by means of a letter following the Committee on Budgetary Control’s decision on the granting of discharge to the Council. I would like to express my sincere thanks to the Presidency of the Council for this new offer. I take the view that we should take up this offer of negotiations with the highest-ranking negotiating delegation we can muster. I also believe that we should not go into the negotiations with predetermined ideas. I therefore recommended to my group that we should abstain at this point. (The speaker agreed to take a blue-card question under Rule 149(8)) Jens Geier  (S&amp;D

 Mr Søndergaard, I am happy to give you the answer to this, which is that these are simply rumours. At this point, I could simply fall back on the position of not commenting on rumours. However, I have just presented our group’s position, namely, that we are going to abstain at this juncture in order to enable negotiations to take place with the Council on a level not encumbered with predetermined ideas. We acted in a similar way when it came to your discharge report for the Council. Jens Geier  (S&amp;D

 Mr President, I would like to issue an explanation of vote on behalf of the Group of the Progressive Alliance of Socialists and Democrats in the European Parliament. The question of the granting of discharge for the Council by the European Parliament has been an institutional bone of contention for years. The Council and Parliament have not yet managed to resolve this issue amicably. The European Parliament bases its argument for its right to grant discharge on Article 319 of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union, and the corresponding articles in the Financial Regulation. It goes without saying that the S&amp;D Group shares this position. We insist on Parliament’s right to monitor and evaluate the proper use of taxpayers’ money by the Council. So far, the Council has not been in agreement with this view. At present, the Council argues that it is granted discharge along with the Commission budget. The S&amp;D Group does not share this view. We want to see a clear and balanced procedure that has been negotiated with the Council and that sets out the rights and obligations of the institutions. We are convinced that we should take the negotiated route first. This is because the non-granting of discharge to the Council will have no impact, as the EU Treaty does not provide for any consequences for such an occurrence. However, since the non-granting of discharge remains legally without consequence, the S&amp;D Group decided to abstain. Jens Geier,  
rapporteur for the opinion of the Committee on Regional Development

 Madam President, I would like to use a minute now as rapporteur for the opinion of the Committee on Regional Development and then speak for two minutes later in the debate on behalf of my group. Madam President, Mr Becsey, Commissioner Šemeta, President Caldeira, ladies and gentlemen, the regional policy budget remains the Achilles heel of the European Union general budget. Five percent of payments from the European Regional Fund still have errors and must therefore be described as irregular payments. Even some of the payments that appear to be correct are actually supporting grotesque projects. May I remind you that an Elton John concert in Naples was subsidised by the European Regional Fund. It was said to be a measure to promote tourism. That might be the case, but in my opinion real regional aid for Naples should take a different form. The reason for this is that all too often the Member States still consider funding from the European Regional Fund to be soft money. This is obvious from the fact that there is a backlog of repayments due from irregular payments, from the fact that very often the Commission has to use the instrument of suspending payments – something that, as budget controllers, we expressly welcome – and from the fact that the punctuality of reporting suffers. The Director General for Regional Policy cannot provide us with any assurance as to the legality and reliability of over half the operational programmes because the reporting by the Member States is inadequate. Ladies and gentlemen, we still have a lot to do here. Jens Geier  (S&amp;D
).

 Mr President, I would like to thank Mr Ulmer for his noticeably factual contribution. It makes a pleasant contrast to many of the things that I have heard said about the agencies this morning. It is extremely depressing that many of the Members from the Eurosceptic parts of this House can never think of anything else but the agencies when it comes to budget cuts. May I remind you that when these agencies were allocated it seemed that the prime ministers and governments of the Member States of the European Union could not get enough of these agencies on their soil. Yet now people are acting as if they are the scourge of the European Union. I am very pleased at the announcement of a study by the European Court of Auditors into the management costs of the agencies. I believe it will provide us with a basis to at last have a more objective debate. I am delighted – as I said previously in my first contribution – that the representatives of the Hungarian Presidency are here with us this morning. That is not something we can take for granted when there is a debate that includes the discharge of the Council. I would therefore like to address you directly, Mr Becsey. I am pleased that the Council is prepared to recognise – as I took from the comments made by Mr Deutsch – that the budget proceedings and the discharge procedure must be dealt with differently. This European Parliament is the people’s representation and it demands accountability for the use of taxpayers’ money. We will therefore not shirk from demanding that the Council be held accountable for the money given to the Council from the Community budget to finance its work. Of course, there is plenty that we could negotiate on, such as what form the discharge procedure should take in the future. However, I should like to ask you whether you seriously expect the European Parliament to negotiate on something that is our right under the treaties. After all, that could only result in this right being restricted. I fail to see why I, as a Member of the European Parliament, would do that. Unfortunately, we do not have many opportunities to discuss things together and I would be delighted if you would take this opportunity to make it clear to us for once who it is in the Council that is actually fighting against the necessary transparency.

 Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, when I listen to the debate on the House of European History, it seems to me that there are only two types of Members in this House: the budget specialists, who attend this debate and who are largely critical of this project, and everybody else, who seem to find the whole thing to be just fine. The worst thing here is that when it comes to the issue of the House of European History there are so many cooks that people have actually lost sight of the point of the whole exercise. Thus, the Daily Telegraph today reported that documents have come into its possession indicating that the cost of this project has risen to the astronomical figure of GBP 137 million. I can only invite the Daily Telegraph to forward these documents to the Committee on Budgets and to let us see from it some of the transparency that the press demands from the Members of this House. I would welcome an opportunity to examine the evidence. Does this project make sense? Naturally it makes sense to foster an awareness of what the European Union and European integration have meant for people’s lives. Should a parliament operate a museum? No, definitely not. That is why the Group of the Progressive Alliance of Socialists and Democrats in the European Parliament have followed two guiding principles on this project. The first is: we demand that the project should have a business plan. The second is: we want clarity on the follow-up costs, that is, how this project is to be funded going forward. We might add a third principle: we should avoid any duplications or overlaps between the Infocentre and the House of European History. Jens Geier,

 Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, Commissioner Šemeta, We know that 80% of the EU budget is administered in a shared management arrangement, which means that money is administered and spent in the Member States, which is exactly where the errors, irregularities and fraud occur. The annual report on the protection of the European Union’s financial interests is a bit like the Member States’ list of sins, which is why I would like to thank Mr Cătălin Sorin and the shadow rapporteurs from the other groups for their hard work. I found the Commission’s report on the protection of the European Union’s financial interests contains one remarkable sentence – on page 11 in the German version. It reads: ‘For the Objective 2 programmes, the very high irregularity rates of the UK and the Netherlands, which mainly benefit from this type of programmes, may have influenced the overall rate.’ The United Kingdom and the Netherlands are two of the countries that have proposed cutting the European budget. From my position I can only call on them to make sure that European taxpayers’ money is spent correctly and to combat the level of irregularities in their countries. I would be very interested to hear whether you have anything else to add in this context, Commissioner. Jens Geier  (S&amp;D

Madam President, Commissioner Lewandowski, ladies and gentlemen, this morning we are debating the need to make savings in view of the debt crisis that we are experiencing in the Member States. Mrs Trüpel and others have quite rightly pointed out that this debt crisis affects us only indirectly, as it is not permitted for debts to be incurred at European level. Yet how can we pursue an austerity policy in the European Union if the volume of European expenditure is only 2% of the total public expenditure of all 27 Member States? I believe that this is not an austerity policy at all. Instead, it is a question of symbols – symbols that are in some way passed to us by the Member States as if money that is transferred to Brussels for the European budget in effect disappears into a deep black hole. This completely ignores the fact that the funds that go into the European budget actually go back to the Member States again. Of course, they do not go back at a ratio of 1:1, as Europe is not a savings bank, and we naturally pursue a policy of solidarity where we support those in the European Union that are less well developed. For example, in my state of North Rhine-Westphalia in Germany, all of the labour market instruments that are now implemented there are cofinanced by the European Social Fund. If we remove this funding, there will be correspondingly less labour market policy. That cannot be what Social Democrats are aiming for. Let us consider for a moment how the Member States spend European funds. The Court of Auditors’ annual report states that there are deficiencies in the way the management and control systems for spending European funds operate. It states that the recovery of wrongly invested funds in the Member States runs into billions of euro. It also states that the Commission is now, thankfully, going to suspend payments in cases where European programmes are being mismanaged. That is also happening for example in Germany and the United Kingdom. The Council, which is not here, represents the Member States, which I urgently call on to improve their management of EU budgetary resources. The increase in efficiency that this would make possible would allow us to considerably improve the way we spend EU funds – not by spending more money but by improving the way we spend it. The Member States can play a part in this in order to underline their willingness to make savings. Jens Geier  (S&amp;D
).

 Madam President, Mr Lewandowski, ladies and gentlemen, naturally, we should discuss the costs that are to be avoided or saved in this budget. However, I would call on you all to be a little more objective in your knee-jerk responses to the discussion in relation to the agencies. Why is this? Firstly, because the Committee on Budgetary Control is permanently engaged in this debate and also draws attention to ways in which cooperation between the agencies and the performance of their duties can be improved, and also because we are expecting a special report on the agencies this year from the European Court of Auditors and will then have a more objective basis for what is, at present, a somewhat ill-considered discussion, particularly with regard to the question of how the agencies are managed and how we may be able to achieve these savings. Speaking of savings, I would like to come to my next topic, our building policy. The fact is that when it comes to the buildings of the European Union, we can certainly save resources. Speaking personally, I would question whether it is really a good idea to build new buildings for the European Parliament in Brussels because this strategy really only makes sense if real estate prices in Brussels continuously rise. At present, the market would not seem to support this. If real estate prices on the market do not rise, then the option of renting rather than buying really does make sense, particularly when you walk around the European quarter with your eyes open and see how much office space is actually available to rent in the area. Which brings me to the issue of the House of European History. I believe that greater legitimacy is required here because it is not enough that to date, all the initiatives for the establishment of the House of European History are simply based on resolutions by the Bureau of this House and have no democratic legitimacy. This needs to change. Above all, we need to know how the operating costs and follow-up costs of this institution are to be covered. Jens Geier  (S&amp;D

 Mr President, Commissioner Barnier, ladies and gentlemen, we all know that the European Union does not have the best reputation. This often results from the fact that workers do not feel that the balance between freedom and security is protected or that it needs to be restored in many areas. This can be seen, for example, in the Services Directive, since it is an important driver of the internal market but also throws a spotlight on the limitations of that market at the same time. The review is therefore important. It is a complex task, and one to which Mrs Gebhardt has provided absolutely outstanding answers. There are still some challenges to be overcome, however. The Services Directive must not, under any circumstances, undermine the fundamental principle of equal pay for equal work in the same location. We must therefore carefully ensure, through all the monitoring opportunities that have been made available to us, that cross-border services, too, do not violate this principle. The point of single contact must provide fair access to the market of the country in which the service is to be provided. However, this is not only for the service providers themselves and the companies, for whom in my home city of Essen, for example, there are six officials – for four towns – who feel responsible. It is also for the workers. In that regard, it is absolutely crucial what language these points of single contact speak. In the Committee on Regional Development, we had a fairly hopeless discussion on this. In my view, the languages of the neighbouring countries should be used. Jens Geier  (S&amp;D

 Madam President, Mr Almunia, ladies and gentlemen, I would like to refer briefly to two points. One of them concerns competitiveness, which is raised in a number of different areas of the report. I would like to ask you to remember how many mining accidents we hear about in the media. This is due to the fact that mining and, in particular, coal mining is going on all over the world, but unfortunately, the safety standards elsewhere are very low when compared with those in German or other European pits. This may seem like overstating the case, but personally, I do not think much of competitiveness which is bought at the expense of miners’ lives. However, if we are looking at the consequences for industrial policy of an early exit from coal mining, I would like to say that the European mining equipment industry is competitive. I would like to invite all those people who believe that mining is an industry of the past and, in particular, Mr Klinz, to pay a visit to a mine. They will soon realise that mining uses high-tech solutions and that it is a question of whether or not we want this industry to continue to be profitable. I know that this is not what the Group of the Alliance of Liberals and Democrats for Europe wants. I am afraid that the mining machinery industry will follow mining production and move out of Europe. Jens Geier  (S&amp;D

Madam President, I would like to ask Mr van Dalen whether he is aware that the high percentages refer only to the percentage of the sample. In other words, it is not 36% of the payments that are in error, but 36% of the payments in the sample. If this is extrapolated up, the result is at least 5% in the case of the Cohesion Fund. Therefore, the billions that you referred to are not accurate amounts. Were you aware of this? Jens Geier  (S&amp;D
). 
 – (DE)
 Madam President, Mr Caldeira, Mr Šemeta, cohesion policy is the sick man of the EU budget. Last year, he was in intensive care and this year he is convalescing. However, he is far from making a full recovery and he could have a relapse at any time. More than 5% of all the cohesion policy payments were in error and 3% should not have been made at all. This amounts to around EUR 700 million. A large proportion of these erroneous payments could have been prevented by the Member States. The errors are occurring in public procurement and in the payment of cohesion funding, despite the existing control systems, which have been approved by the Commission. We need to take another careful look at these control systems. In my home country of Germany, the samples showed that all the control systems there which had been tested were only partially effective. The responsibility for managing the budget lies with the Commission. We can discuss this contradiction – errors in the Member States which are the responsibility of the Commission – in our home countries, we can explain it to the media and we can tell our citizens about it. However, in political terms, it is the job of the Commission to resolve this problem in the Member States. Mr Šemeta, you need to take control in this area and you will have our support for doing so.

Madam President, Mr Oettinger, as rapporteur for the opinion of the Committee on Budgets concerning Mrs Van Brempt’s report, I can say that the members of the committee very much welcomed this report. We have looked at it not only from a budgetary perspective, but also, to certain extent, with regard to its content and we have raised one concern, which Mrs Van Brempt was kind enough to include. This instrument is aimed at municipalities and rightly so, because this is where the greatest increases in efficiency can be achieved. However, I come from an area of Germany where the municipalities cannot take out any additional loans, because they are already too heavily in debt. This may be a problem specific to Germany, because of our local authority constitutions, but Mr Oettinger, as a former head of a Federal German state, will be only too familiar with this subject. Therefore, in Germany, we are in a position where those local authorities which should be making use of this programme are not allowed to, because the body responsible for supervising them has prevented them from taking on any further debt. We are very concerned about this. It could result in this programme being ineffective in these areas. We welcome this programme and would be pleased if it could be continued. We have called for the programme to have a separate budget line and we would like to transfer to it the EUR 15 million available in the agricultural policy area which cannot be accessed there because there is no legal basis for doing so. This is where the budget needs to be more flexible. Jens Geier  (S&amp;D

 Madam President, Mr Wathelet, Commissioner, I believe that we are all agreed, even the gentlemen and the few ladies among the Eurosceptic to anti-Europe fractions of this House, that the EU performs important tasks and that the performance of these tasks represents European added value, because the nation states either cannot perform them or the final beneficiaries would not receive this money from the nation states. The latter scenario is due, in particular, to the fact that the Member States would not invest savings, but would have to use them to reduce debt, whereas the European budget is largely an investor. Thus, if we want to achieve the goals that are set here every week, we need an ambitious budget, and that means not less money, but more money in future. In this connection, I believe it is important to emphasise that the national budgets and the European budget are complementary to one another. The Council and the Member States behave as if money that goes into the European budget more or less disappears into a large black hole. That is not the case; it is invested in goals that we have previously agreed on here. We therefore also need, as Mr Böge proposes, a critical examination of the medium-term financial programme. This, of course, can only serve to show that the Council cannot say ‘yes’ to the Treaty of Lisbon while, at the same time, putting forward one or other project for financing and then saying: but you will not get any money for its implementation. If it is not possible, then we will resort to the necessary deletions of the budget lines that Parliament does not regard as priorities. Ladies and gentlemen, we will have this discussion again and again while the EU does not have sufficient funds of its own. What is important – no, essential – is that these own resources do not impose an additional burden on normal wage earners. As a Social Democrat, I am in favour of the introduction of a financial transaction tax, because in general, this will not affect normal wage earners and it will help to put the brakes on the financial market. We firmly believe that those who triggered a crisis, the like of which we have never seen before, and the costs of which we all have to pay out of the public budgets of our own Member States, should be called on to compensate for these losses.

 Mr President, Mr Barroso, Mr Zapatero, from the point of view of those in charge of budgetary control in this House, the Spanish Presidency has made history. We are grateful that this Presidency has succeeded in removing the discharge procedure for the Council from the sphere of obscurity. Previously, the Council has refused to lay adequate accounts before the European Parliament. Sessions had, at best, an informal character. One had to collect documents bit by bit, or they were unavailable. Answers to questions were unsatisfactory. The Council would refer in all seriousness to an agreement dating from 1970, the ‘gentlemen’s agreement’, which allegedly clarifies issues concerning the discharge, although this gentlemen’s agreement spares not a single word on this matter. This has now changed. The Secretary-General of the Council has agreed to introduce a discharge procedure worthy of the name in a transparent procedure in compliance with democratic standards. This success of the Spanish Presidency testifies to the democratic and European convictions of the Spanish Government. For this, it deserves the praise of this House. Jens Geier  (S&amp;D

 Mr President, Mr Maystadt, Mr Rehn, I would first like to thank Mr Deutsch for his work. However, I would also like to take the opportunity to emphasise the importance of the European Investment Bank (EIB) for Europe and for the citizens of Europe and to highlight the fact that we must make greater use of this unique institution, in particular in times of economic crisis. From the perspective of budgetary control, which in modern terms also covers the actual output and performance of European programmes and institutions, the EIB has definitely earned its high rating, in particular with regard to political reliability. It creates real added value for the people of Europe by means of the investments made in its six main programmes, ranging from the Trans-European Networks to supporting small and medium-sized enterprises, and its special programmes, such as the project to combat climate change. I am sure that this will receive broad support in the European Parliament. However, this also means that Parliament must in future extend its own supervisory procedures. I am referring here, for example, to the investment facility. Finally, I would like to make one further point which is particularly important to my group and which is aimed directly at the EIB. We welcome the fact that the EIB has revised its policy on offshore financial centres. However, we also need the assurance that income produced from EIB funds will not make its way into tax havens of this kind, otherwise the EIB would risk damaging the reputation and the rating that it has built up.

Good morning Mr President, ladies and gentlemen. I would like to repeat that, in my opinion, it is rather difficult to conduct a debate in the absence of those to whom we are supposed to grant discharge, with whom we want to discuss the reasons why we are granting discharge or are postponing discharge or whatever else we have to talk to them about. I know many of the honourable Members of this House from the committee. We also know our respective positions. It is fine that we will exchange them once again this morning, but it is not really helpful. In this context, I would like to propose that in committee, we deliberate formally inviting the institutions we are discussing to the next discharge debate and postponing the debates accordingly if they are not present. Discharge to the European institutions comes at a difficult, but important moment. A consequence of the financial crisis is that all governments are having to review their respective budgets and ensure that they are meeting their requirements. We are in the first year of a new legislative period of the European Parliament and are dealing with a newly assembled Commission. In terms of the discharge, we are, however, considering the 2008 budget, which was under the responsibility of the previous Commission. This opens a multitude of new perspectives. Among these new perspectives, we should expect a new way of thinking and a new approach on the part of the Member States since, for the first time, the Treaty of Lisbon names them as being co-responsible for the implementation of the EU budget. In terms of the 2008 budgetary review, it was the rapporteur’s intention to ensure that the Commission concentrates entirely on possibilities for improvement in budgetary control and that the Member States are on board for that as well. As the Group of the Progressive Alliance of Socialists and Democrats in the Committee on Budgetary Control, it is our goal that in future, every discharge report – on the basis of the judgment of the European Court of Auditors – is better than the previous one. It all depends on the Council assuming its new key roll in the light of the importance of the Member States. It would be equally helpful if the European Court of Auditors looked for ways of redressing the imbalance that is, on the one hand, the result of annual reporting and the multiannual duration of many EU programmes and the logic of their implementation by the Commission and the Member States. As the budgetary authority, we continue to have great concerns regarding some specific areas of responsibility, and, in particular, those in which the EU intends to implement its political priorities. For example, cohesion in the European Union is essential and therefore, the funds that flow into structural policy are particularly important. Here, we need to continue combating sources of errors decisively through simpler rules and recovering funds wrongly paid. We need finer instruments to measure results and we call on the Court of Auditors to develop these instruments, in order to be able to identify precisely the sources of errors. We know that the action plan for the structural funds that provides for recovery is finally being implemented and we must now wait for it to have an effect. Pre-accession aid has the goal of enabling fundamental processes of change in these states and problems in target setting and implementation must be remedied. What will not do, however, is the fact that the goal of the accession process is effectively being torpedoed through the back door. Therefore, I call on the House to reject the attempt by the Group of the European People’s Party (Christian Democrats) to use amendments to turn the position of the European Parliament on Turkey’s accession process on its head, as recorded in the resolution on the progress report. We are looking forward to the appointment of a new Director-General of the European Antifraud Office (OLAF) to end the ongoing debate, and also the Commission’s proposals on the reform of OLAF, in order to improve the crucial work of this office. Finally, to external policy actions. We need a demonstration of the determination of the EU to contribute to the resolution of problems worldwide. These actions must be highly effective, even under the most difficult circumstances. In the coming months, we must discuss the current management of EU funds in this area with the Commission and how these funds will be managed in future by the European External Action Service. We are, however, making some progress. Our group is particularly pleased with the steps the Commission is taking as regards the annual management reports of the Member States, for example, since we are thereby getting closer to the realisation of an old demand of the Group of the Progressive Alliance of Socialists and Democrats. The same is true for the financial corrections and recoveries, since this is also an opportunity to reduce an unacceptably high rate of errors. These points give us, among other things, the opportunity, some considerations notwithstanding, to call for the discharge of the Commission. I thank you and look forward to your comments. Jens Geier  (S&amp;D

Mr President, Commissioner, Mr López Garrido, I am delighted that you are here and so demonstrate the Council’s recognition of this important debate. Ladies and gentlemen, we all know this little trick: if you want to embarrass someone, ask them a question with a wording like, do you still actually smack your children? Even if the person says no, they have implicitly admitted that in the past, they did smack their children. The discharge report for Parliament by Mr Staes, who I would like to thank for his work, is a critical report, and to me, in some areas at least, it has followed this logic. Self-criticism is good, but it should then be accurate. I have had many discussions in my group on how we might reject this or that wording in the report on Parliament’s discharge. Some of us have come under more than a little pressure in our home countries regarding this. However, I do want to convey to you my answers to these questions as to why we have rejected some wording or other in the report on Parliament’s discharge. There are proposals that are already a reality. We could re-table them, but why? There are proposals that are not helpful, such as the idea of making the Committee on Budgetary Control a sort of alternative internal audit authority or an intermediary between the Bureau and plenary. There are many good proposals in this report that were, however, all adopted. Then there are proposals in this report that only represent a partial reality, as, for example, in Amendment 26 now on the table. This amendment demands the establishing of an internal control system in groups of this House. Nothing should be more obvious. In the Group of the Progressive Alliance of Socialists and Democrats, however, this has long been a reality, precisely for that reason. If my group were to agree to this, we would be acting as if we had some catching up to do. Therefore, we can, in this example, only agree if this reality is also illustrated in the report. I therefore propose adding the following phrase to this paragraph: as it is the fact in the S&amp;D Group. Jens Geier,  
deputising for the rapporteur.

Mr President, so that the Minutes are correct, I represent rapporteur Bogusław Liberadzki, who, like many others in this House, has been a victim of the transport problems this week. I am very happy to do so and would like to use the opportunity to go over a few of the remarks made during the debate. For a start, Commissioner Šemeta, to my great satisfaction, you have stressed that the Commission will take steps to further strengthen the accountability of the leading actors in the management of EU funds. We all know what that means. Indeed, we all know that it means that we must remind the Member States of the European Union that manage a large portion of European funds of their responsibility to do so in accordance with good practice, because we also all know that the majority of the errors that are made in the utilisation of European funds are made by the Member States and at this level. That is why it is also rather unsatisfactory to hear colleagues from the European Conservatives and Reformists Group and the Europe of Freedom and Democracy Group, all of whom, including Mr Czarnecki, have other commitments, strongly criticising the Commission in the debate and saying that the Commission will be refused discharge. I would have expected my fellow Members to support pushing for national management statements in this House and also in the Member States, because that is where mistakes are being made and there is insufficient cooperation. Then it is rather unsatisfactory to hear colleagues from the ECR Group say that everything that happens here is substandard – knowing quite well that responsibility lies somewhere else entirely. Once again, I would like to mention pre-accession aid, because I feel that a few things have to be put right there. I would like to remind you that the Committee on Budgetary Control supported the rapporteur with a slight majority. I would also like to remind you that during the reporting, the representative of the European Court of Auditors sought to remind the rapporteur that his report was about the behaviour of the Commission as regards what was deemed to be worthy of criticism, not about the behaviour of Turkey. Our fellow Members in the Group of the European People’s Party (Christian Democrats) have voted amendments into the discharge of the Commission that we would like to remove straightaway, because here it is obviously less about the utilisation of taxpayers’ money and more about the question of where accession negotiations with Turkey are going. Deciding that at this point is the wrong way to go. Jens Geier  (S&amp;D

 Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, I would like to draw the attention of the European Commission and of this House to the worrying developments with regard to the prices of raw materials. Duisburg, home of the largest steelworks in Europe, is in my constituency. Here, and in the other steel-producing locations in the EU, the employees are very concerned about their jobs because the three large suppliers of iron ore are forcing price increases of 100% on the steel industry. In future, the price of ore is to be traded on the London Metal Exchange instead of price security being ensured, as was previously the case, by means of long-term supply contracts. The workforce and its trade unions fear that this will result in an extreme rise in the price of the base material, steel. This comes at a time when the potential areas for savings by means of cost-cutting programmes and reductions in the workforce, particularly after the most recent restructuring in the steel industry, have been completely exhausted. In order to draw attention to this situation, works councils and Germany’s Industrial Union of Metalworkers have directed an appeal on behalf of Duisburg to Chancellor Merkel and to President Barroso. I would ask the Commission to respond to this appeal. Jens Geier  (S&amp;D
).

 Mr President, Mr Kallas, Mr Caldeira, ladies and gentlemen, firstly I would like to thank you, Mr Caldeira, for your introduction and I would like to thank you and the members of the Court of Auditors for your report. Parliament will investigate carefully the information you have provided and will act on it in the coming months. I was pleased that the previously unacceptable error rate of the common agricultural policy has fallen. However, after reading the Court of Auditors’ report, I have the impression that one Member State, namely Romania, is responsible for the majority of the remaining irregularities. It seems that we must put more emphasis in future on training staff and implementing control systems correctly in the new Member States, if possible, before their accession. The European Structural Funds, which many of my fellow Members have already mentioned, represent another cause for concern. It is true that the number of irregular payments has fallen when compared with the previous year, but there are still huge problems in ensuring that aid funding is handled without irregularities occurring. I would like to say to the Eurosceptic parts of this House that we are talking about 11% of the total payments and not 11% of the budget. This amounts to EUR 2.7 billion and not EUR 5 billion. I admit that this is still EUR 2.7 billion too much, but we must be accurate for the sake of honesty. These irregularities relate mainly to excessive payments and the incorrect use of funds. For example, if European Social Fund (ESF) money is used to pay the salary of a public administrator or if European Regional Development Fund (ERDF) money is used to buy a building plot, then the people concerned obviously do not have sufficient information about the correct use of aid funding or the Member States do not have the will or the ability to administer the funding correctly, or perhaps all of the above. When we revise the application procedure, we must put in place clear, transparent rules which are easier to understand. The Member States must ensure that the applications are monitored more carefully at a national level. It is clear that any waste or any irregularities in relation to European taxpayers’ money is too much. However, anybody who takes an impartial look at the EU and at this report from the European Court of Auditors will find little cause for offence. It offers a number of starting points for our work, which consists of making Europe better and more efficient every day. On this basis we will implement the discharge procedure for the European Commission. Jens Geier  (S&amp;D
). 
 – (DE)
 Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I, too, would like to thank Mr Søndergaard for his successful work, as a result of which the Council ultimately accommodated Parliament in the discharge procedure. The Council refused, for a long while, to provide pertinent answers to Parliament’s questions, citing the Gentlemen’s Agreement – an agreement of an informal nature which is now, in any case, 40 years old. This seems downright bizarre when Council officials, after 40 years, clearly no longer know what exactly the Gentlemen’s Agreement states, since the version provided by the European Parliament contains precisely the opposite of what the Council claimed again and again in the negotiations. The first resolution of the Gentleman’s Agreement stated that the Council would not attempt to make any changes to the European Parliament’s expenditure. The third resolution states that there should be close cooperation between the two institutions on budget issues. The Council takes this to mean that each institution will leave the budgetary activity of the other alone. At this point, I will refrain from commenting on the seriousness of this line of argument. Instead, I would like to thank the Swedish Presidency of the Council for having begun the process of bringing an end to this ignoble state of affairs. The solution is an addendum to the interinstitutional agreement that clearly regulates the procedure for the granting of discharge to the Council by Parliament, as the proposed motion for a resolution demands. I therefore ask the House to support the motion. Jo Leinen  (S&amp;D

After 30 years of civil war there was a lot of chaos in Sri Lanka and colleagues have said that there are improvements but not enough. But you are speaking about a balanced resolution and you are calling for a comprehensive investigation by March 2014 – that is three months from now. Do you think that is realistic? Why do you impose such an ultimatum, rather than stating ‘in due time’, as you yourself said? March 2014 is completely unrealistic – do you not agree? Jo Leinen,

 Mr President, I am a member of Parliament’s delegation to India, and I love the people and the country. But, like all of us, I was shocked by the atrocity of this gang rape against a young student. Sexual violence against women is, unfortunately, a widespread phenomenon in India, especially in the capital, Delhi. The rape of this young girl is only the tip of the iceberg.  In our resolution we ask the Indian Government to investigate the cases of persons occupying senior official posts – up to the top levels of the Parliament and the government – against whom formal accusations of rape are outstanding, and call for those persons to give up their public functions. We call upon the Indian authorities to take effective measures to train police forces to handle rape cases better, and we call for the Indian criminal law to be amended to punish all forms of sexual assault. The European Union and the Member States should work with Indian authorities on special campaigns and programmes to combat gender-based violence. More has to be done to protect women and to implement Article 51 of the Indian Constitution, which forbids any practice against the dignity of women. Parliament’s delegation visits India in early May, and I am sure we will address this issue with our partners in the Indian Parliament. Jo Leinen  (S&amp;D

 Mr President, Mr Potočnik, in view of the enormous challenges facing nature and the environment, as well as the planet’s ecosystems, it must be admitted that the Rio conference is a missed opportunity. I see the glass as half empty rather than half full because the world continues to be ravaged and we have still failed to identify sufficient specific objectives and schedules or concrete obligations to enable us to change course in favour of sustainable development. The shift in power evident in Rio has been remarkable. It is interesting that an emerging economy like Brazil, supported by China and India, should present a document without there being the opportunity to change it. I would have liked to have seen more courage from Europe – acting together with the African Union perhaps – in support of the United Nations Environment Programme (UNEP), exerting more pressure so that the UNEP would become a UN organisation. What happens next? Of course we have our hopes. I believe that hopes spring from the grass roots: green cities and green business. The Rio conference hosted more mayors and more CEOs than any previous environmental summit. We should identify the urban environment as a focus area in the seventh EU Environmental Action Programme. The majority of people now live in cities, which is where the greatest amount of energy and most resources are consumed, providing a good starting point. The same applies to progressive enterprises. They have understood that it is only possible to do business when the fundamental structures for commerce are in place. We need to establish an alliance with green business. We in Parliament also need to take action. The UN has established eight major groups: business, urban areas, women, trade unions, etc. Parliaments also need to become more involved, which is why it was a pity that we did not have an official delegation at the conference. We should form a major group at UN conferences under the ‘parliaments’ banner. Jo Leinen  (S&amp;D

 Mr President, it is, in any case, a bad habit that we have here in Parliament that a text is read out for one or two minutes and people cannot speak on one or two thoughts without notes. That has annoyed me ever since I joined the European Parliament. However, I will use my time for the subject in hand. Mr Potočnik, you quite rightly described the 2050 energy road map as a great transformation for our economy and society, for production and consumption. For this great transformation, you need all the players, and at all levels. I think it is good that you are establishing a platform for resource efficiency in Brussels. We ought to have the same thing at the level of the Member States and the regions, right down to municipalities. My question is this: do you have a plan for this? Mr Bütikofer rightly asked about resource efficiency plans. That is the same subject. For climate protection, we have the National Adaptation Programmes of Action (NAPAs) and the Nationally Appropriate Mitigation Actions (NAMAs). Naturally, we also need resource efficiency plans here. Do you intend to present this to the Member States? Then, of course, you will need all the other portfolios. I will simply mention the finance ministers – this has already been mentioned: the phasing out of environmentally harmful subsidies, the incorporation of external costs into our tax system. How can we win over the finance ministers and, not least, the ministers for economic affairs? We need new business models that reward sustainability and not the consumption of resources. For that, we need to think about something new with the ministers for economic affairs. (The speaker agreed to take a blue-card question under Rule 149(8)) Jo Leinen  (S&amp;D

Blue-card answer.

 Thank you for your follow-up question, Ms Merkies. In fact, the traditional business model is built upon the consumption, and even the wasting, of resources. The manufacturer produces something, does not deal with the waste, the product goes to the consumer and perhaps also ends up being thrown away. That is no longer acceptable. We need a new business model in which the manufacturer is responsible – from production through to recovery, to recycling. Then, I believe, there will be new designs for products. There are new responsibilities for recirculation. That is the direction we must move in. Jo Leinen,

 Mr President, Mr Potočnik, ladies and gentlemen, the European Parliament wants to introduce a 7th Environment Action Programme (EAP) in the European Union. It would not make sense for us to give up our efforts to improve the quality of the environment and of health in Europe when the 6th EAP comes to an end in June. However, the 7th EAP must not be a copy of the 6th programme. We have come much further along the road and we are facing much bigger challenges. We need to take a new approach in the 7th EAP: a horizontal approach covering all other areas of policy. We are exposed to systemic risks. Mr Potočnik, you have just mentioned the fact that climate change, the loss of biodiversity and the shortage of resources are all challenges which cannot be overcome by traditional environmental policy alone. We need to involve all the other portfolios and all the other policy areas in the EU and, in particular, energy and transport policy, agriculture and fisheries policy, cohesion policy and, most importantly, economic and financial policy. I would like to emphasise this point, because this is the most difficult aspect. How can we ensure that the finance and economy ministers treat greening as a central issue within their areas? Parliament has drafted 80 paragraphs containing proposals for the content and the procedure for a 7th EAP and these include calls for the abolition of subsidies which harm the environment. Following the greening of tax policy, we must incorporate external costs in our prices. The principle that the polluter pays must be applied gradually. As part of our macro-economic controls, we also need to monitor sustainability within the European Semester. We have come up with many other ideas in this area. Europe’s environmental footprint as a whole is far too large. If all the 7 billion people on this planet today and the 9 billion that there will be by the middle of the century were to use as much energy and as many resources as we do, we would need two planets, not just one. We know that there are limits to the resources which our planet can provide. For this reason, we need to make major cuts in our resource consumption. The 7th EAP must open the door to a green economy and to a policy of resource efficiency. We need to focus, in particular, on urban environments. More and more people are living in large conurbations and in these areas, we can set a good example of resource management and resource efficiency. Green cities are our objective in Europe. There are many good examples and best practices which must be applied everywhere. Of course, protecting the environment should also help us to protect people’s health. We must send out a clear message to the public that protecting the environment and public health form an integral part of the 7th EAP. This will help to ensure that it gains acceptance. There are still a number of difficulties in this area. Air pollution levels are still too high and noise pollution is a huge problem. Noise is an issue that has been neglected and completely underrated in our environmental policy. There are still many toxic chemicals that make their way into the environment and have an impact on health. Nanomaterials and other new materials need careful investigation and also present us with new challenges. The best legislation and the best programmes are useless if they are not implemented. The 7th EAP must resolve the problem of the implementation deficit. Ultimately, I believe that Europe must send a message to the world that we need sustainable management. Otherwise, the human race will not survive on earth. Jo Leinen,  
rapporteur.

 Mr President, the debate has shown that there is a consensus in favour of the 7th Environment Action Programme (EAP) within the European Parliament. I would like to thank all the shadow rapporteurs who have helped us to reach this consensus. I would also like to thank Mr Potočnik, who took the initiative within the Commission, because not everyone there supported the 7th EAP at first sight. It is clear that there was a certain level of resistance. Following the debate in the Council of Environment Ministers and in the European Parliament, it is clear how useful and how important a 7th EAP can be, because it brings together all the objectives which were previously spread across different strategies and road maps. The amalgamation of these objectives, the message that Europe’s environmental footprint must be reduced and the measures needed to achieve this are the main points of the 7th EAP. I would like to say once again that we need to address our calls to the finance and economy ministers. I hope that the report will not be watered down during the vote later today. We must call for the greening of tax policy and economic policy because we will not be able to make our economy sustainable by means of environmental policy alone. This point has been made in many of today’s speeches. The environmental strategy must be reflected in the finance strategy. We will soon be debating the medium-term financial plan up to 2020 and the Commission has proposed putting aside for climate change and sustainability 20% of the billions of euro available. I believe that this should be a minimum and I hope that Parliament can increase this figure during the negotiations. We must not allow 80% of the funding to be devoted to areas that go against the environment and only 20% to be used to protect the environment. Overall, this has been an important debate and we are looking forward to your draft, Mr Potočnik. This will go into the ordinary legislative procedure where it will be finalised. We will help to ensure that the result is an ambitious programme. Jo Leinen  (S&amp;D

 Mr Casini, would you agree that, if it accedes to the Convention on Human Rights, the EU must then support the provision of better facilities for the Court in Strasbourg? We know that the judges are completely overloaded and have poorer facilities than the judges in Luxembourg. The EU should – and I am asking you whether you agree with this – ensure that they have the same working conditions, the same standards and the same facilities, as then we can also hope for sound judgments. Would you come out in favour of Parliament and the EU supporting better facilities for the Court in Strasbourg? Jo Leinen,

 Mr President, Commissioner, climate protection requires immediate measures, as well as a long-term strategy if we are to achieve the objective of stabilising the Earth’s atmosphere at 2 °C. The Group of the Progressive Alliance of Socialists and Democrats in the European Parliament supports your Roadmap for 2050. It is an extremely important element in guaranteeing planning certainty and clarity in relation to where the path is to take us. All those involved, particularly the economic sector, eagerly await this planning certainty and clarity. This makes it all the more regrettable that Friday’s Environment Council meeting was blocked by one country, showing itself to be incapable of making political decisions. I would like to ask the Commission: what is your strategy for rescuing Poland from this psychological and political isolation? We need Poland. Poland is an important country. We need to make it clear that Poland also has enormous opportunities to modernise its economy and deploy new technology in pursuing its climate strategy. Perhaps it is necessary to clarify the assistance the EU can offer and the way in which the effort is distributed among all 27 countries, all of which share a common goal, but which may have different ways of reaching that goal. Commissioner, you must be able to provide an answer here. If we want to reduce CO2
 emissions by 80 to 95%, we need to embrace all sectors, not just industry, but also transport and agriculture. I hope that the amendments tabled here will not dilute our report. We need to speak out clearly in relation to climate neutrality in the transport sector and in favour of major efforts in the agricultural sector. We would encourage you to include not just aviation, but also marine transport in the emissions trading system. You need to show leadership here, and you should not give in. The Emissions Trading System is not working. You need to take corrective action. This report indicates how this can work. I believe, in the final analysis, that we are witnessing a new industrial revolution. The issue at stake is a competitive European economy and climate protection is a key element in the competitiveness of Europe in the 21st century. Jo Leinen  (S&amp;D

 Mr President, I am opposed to the motion. This is a complete surprise from the Group of the European People’s Party (Christian Democrats). We have discussed the motion in the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Food Safety. We have the advantage of excellent groundwork by the Committee on Industry, Research and Energy and the Committee on Agriculture and Rural Development and have discussed this in detail this morning. The Commission and industry at large must know how matters are to proceed with regard to climate protection. I am in favour of voting on this matter today. Jo Leinen,

 Mr President, Ms Hedegaard, the Group of the Progressive Alliance of Socialists and Democrats in the European Parliament would also like to congratulate you on your handling of the negotiations in Durban. The EU has demonstrated its strong leadership skills and this has paid off. I am also pleased about the climate diplomacy and the coalition of 120 states. I would like to see China joining our strategic coalition, alongside Africa. China is moving towards taking over worldwide responsibility. This would send out a signal to the US to bring an end to its policy of denial and to join the mainstream of international climate policy. We have prevented a fiasco and we have produced the road map which we will have to work on. There is, of course, a great deal for us to do at home. We have the gigatonne gap and if Europe wants to play a leading role, it will have to do more than it has in the past. I hope that there will be new initiatives which go beyond 20%. We must take the hot air out of Kyoto 2. The policy cannot really be credible with all these surplus certificates. I would like to encourage you to remain tough in the areas of aviation and shipping and to take new initiatives. It is totally absurd that the US Congress can pass a law banning airlines from taking part in our legislation. We must not allow this to happen and Parliament would like to see you maintaining your tough stance. Jo Leinen,

 Mr President, Ms Maćkowiak-Pandera, Ms Hedegaard, ladies and gentlemen, this week, the European Parliament is submitting a resolution which includes comprehensive proposals on combating global climate change. Mr President, I know that you are committed to overcoming climate change and it would, of course, be good if you could come with the parliamentary delegation to Durban. However, I understand the constraints you are under here in the House with regard to the 2012 budget. Nevertheless, a strong delegation will be going to Durban ready to exert pressure and to use its lobbying skills, so that the process of combating climate change does not come to a halt and so that we can continue to make progress. I would like to thank the sponsors from the five groups who have drawn up this resolution. There was a broad consensus in the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Food Safety about what should now be done and we had the support of the Committee on Development and the Committee on Industry, Research and Energy. Parliament has clear ideas about what we need to achieve in the 17th Conference of the Parties (COP 17) to the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC). We have no time to lose. The extreme weather events in 2011 alone and the melting of the glaciers and icebergs show that climate change is well under way. This is why we need to make substantial progress at the COP 17. Parliament’s goal remains the same: a legally binding instrument for all states in the UNFCCC or a global climate agreement, if you want to call it that. We will not be able to achieve this in Durban, but we need to establish further milestones on the road to a global climate agreement. This is primarily about meeting the promises and the undertakings which were made last year in Cancún. I will only mention the mechanism for technology transfer from rich northern countries to poorer southern ones and the institutions which will put in place the necessary measures to allow us to adapt to climate change. However, there are other open issues which we can hopefully resolve in Durban. One of these concerns closing the gigatonne gap. In Cancún, everyone agreed that we want to limit the global temperature increase to 2 degrees Celsius, but the commitments that are already on the table are not sufficient. We will end up with an increase of 3.5 or 4 degrees Celsius, which is much too much, as we all know. Therefore, we need to understand how the gigatonne gap can be closed on the basis of common but differing responsibilities for stabilising the earth’s atmosphere. We in Parliament are of the opinion that greenhouse gas emissions will peak in 2015 and this is a very ambitious goal. However, the scientists are telling us that we have to reach this point during this decade. We know that by 2050, we must reduce our greenhouse gas emissions by around 50%, which is a huge task. In Durban, the focus is likely to be on the Kyoto Protocol. We must prevent a gap from occurring between the first commitment period and a further second commitment period. Therefore, we need a solution for the period after 2012 and Parliament is calling on the EU to give its clear support to a second commitment period. We know that we do not have many partners, but they include Switzerland and Norway, together with Australia and New Zealand. I believe that with effective climate change diplomacy, we can achieve a critical mass which will make it worthwhile to implement Kyoto II and, at the same time and most importantly, to force the emerging countries and also the USA to commit to a timetable involving everyone. The idea is that we will succeed in implementing an overarching climate agreement in 2015. I would like to mention an issue that we are all aware of: the funding for combating global climate change. We hope that we can establish a Green Climate Fund in Durban, but we need to know who will manage it, who can become a member, how it will work and where the funding will come from. Parliament has made a number of suggestions including the income from emissions trading, taxes on aviation and shipping and the financial transaction tax, if it is imposed. I shall be brief. We must not use the economic crisis as an excuse for doing nothing. The message that comes out of Durban must make it clear that we cannot allow climate change to overcome the human race. Instead, the human race must have the determination to overcome climate change. That is the message that the European Parliament is taking to South Africa. Jo Leinen,

 Mr President, President-in-Office of the Council, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Food Safety here in the European Parliament, in the ‘citizens’ chamber’ of the European Union, is tabling a motion for a resolution in order to raise awareness of the threat to public health caused by the resistance of bacteria to antibiotics and to call on the Commission and the Member States to establish an action programme to combat this threat to public health. I am the Chair of the committee, not the author of this resolution, and you can see that we had sponsors from all political parties. We are in agreement in the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Food Safety that we have a ticking time bomb here, a major problem for the health of our citizens, and that there is an urgent need for action. We need an action plan, because the health authorities in Europe are alarmed. During visits this year to the European Medicines Agency (EMA) in London and also to the European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control (ECDC) in Stockholm, our attention was once again drawn by these specialist agencies of the European Union to this problem in particular. In the EU, around 25 000 people a year are now dying of infections caused by resistant bacteria. If we look at the situation, up to the end of the 1970s there was a great deal of activity in the pharmaceuticals industry aimed at developing new molecules and new agents. Since the end of the 1970s, the activity has diminished and come to a standstill. So, if you like, we stopped focusing on this problem 40 years ago. We are simply lacking new agents to fight this resistance. Commissioner Dalli, at this point the first demand that I am going to make is directed at you as the Commissioner responsible, and it is a call on the Commission to draw up a road map with the industry concerned in order to show more commitment to the search for and development of new molecules and new agents. Together with the actors involved in research and industry, you should draw up this road map so that we can obtain a new protection mechanism. We have mentioned a second issue, with regard to which we would ask you – as well as the Member States – to be actively engaged. Antibiotics help to reduce diseases, but if they are not used properly they can also cause damage. We have discovered that antibiotics are used entirely differently in the 27 Member States of the European Union. The Eurobarometer survey has shown how much ignorance there is. Of the people questioned, 53% believe that antibiotics kill viruses and 43% believe that antibiotics are effective against colds and flu. We can imagine how great the misuse of these substances must be, which then contributes to the resistance and puts other people at risk. We are therefore calling on the Commission to define general principles and best practices for the prudent use of antibiotics for 500 million people, for all 27 Member States, and also to ensure that these guidelines are actually implemented and put into practice everywhere in the European Union. We need a major awareness campaign in this area. We believe that we also need a well-functioning monitoring and surveillance system in this sector. The ECDC in Stockholm is our sectoral authority. We need good data, sound surveys and, of course, also analyses of trends and early warnings of the spread of such resistance. Ladies and gentlemen, there is one final issue that we have addressed in a serious way: the cross-transmission of resistance from animals to humans. Antibiotics are used in veterinary medicine as well as human medicine. There are strong indications that crossovers exist. That means that we need cooperation with veterinary medicine in this regard, above all in order to reduce and prohibit the prophylactic use of antibiotics in intensive livestock farming. In this regard, Commissioner, I hope that our resolution will also serve as a mandate for you as well as for the Polish Presidency to take action so that we can protect our citizens against this new threat to health. (Applause) Jo Leinen  (S&amp;D

– Mr President, I want to make a clarification on paragraph 8 because the formulation is misleading. It reads now in the old text ‘is concerned about the focus given to the green economy as one of the two main themes of the Rio Summit’ – ‘is concerned’ seems to be negative, so it should be ‘concerning the focus given to the green economy as one of the two main themes of the Rio Summit’. This is my oral amendment, not ‘is concerned’, but ‘concerning’. This is not negative, we want the green economy. That is the explanation to the Greens who asked me whether this is positive or negative – it is positive. Jo Leinen  (S&amp;D

 Mr President, Mr Barroso, you have called for a renaissance of the European idea. I believe that we agree that the European idea is good, but it requires a new foundation and a new profile to explain why we need Europe and also more Europe in the 21st century. As the Chair of the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Food Safety, one thing is clear to me. Europe must become a stability union from an environmental perspective and not just from a financial perspective. Young people understand above all that with 9 billion of us living on the planet by the middle part of the century, we will be fighting for energy, raw materials and food. Therefore, let us establish a European pact for environmental stability which includes energy efficiency, the efficient use of resources and sustainability. We have started to do this and it must not be allowed to get lost or be given a lower priority during the crisis. These problems will not go away. They will remain and they may even become more pronounced. Please encourage the whole of the Commission to make progress with the environmental profile of the EU. We will have the young people of Europe behind us. Jo Leinen,

 Mr President, President-in-Office of the Council, Professor Kraszewski, Ms Hedegaard, Mr Potočnik, ladies and gentlemen, the European Parliament very much welcomes the fact that the United Nations is holding the Rio+20 conference. We are submitting a resolution to the European Parliament which has been sponsored by Members from a number of different political groups, in other words, it has broad support in this House, and which states that this Earth summit next year in Brazil must be a success. If we look back 20 years to the first Rio conference in 1992, there was a huge amount of commitment and hope that we would be able to reverse the trend in our economic activities on this planet. When we consider what has happened over the last 20 years, there has certainly been a lot of commitment. Some things have been achieved, but the trends and the megatrends are still going in the wrong direction. If we look at the economy, and we discussed it at length this morning, we can see that a financial economy has developed alongside the real economy, which is far more powerful than the traditional economy. The speculation in the financial economy is threatening the real economy and also jeopardising whole countries and regions and many, many people. If we look at developments in the social sector over the last 20 years, there is incredible wealth and unfortunately also incredible poverty. The divide between rich and poor is getting wider. If we move on to the environment, it is clear that our environmental footprint on this planet is still a negative one. Over the last 20 years we have cleared huge areas of forest. We have overfished the seas. We have used up energy resources which took millions of years to form. We have damaged the soil. These are warning signs for the 21st century which indicate to us that we cannot go on like this. There must be a change of direction. We really need to make a renewed attempt to introduce sustainable development. We need a new departure next year in Rio. We need a new political will and a new sense of commitment. We also need an agenda with concrete proposals. It is clear that the three pillars – the economy, the environment and social development – must be better integrated. Economic activities are a good thing, but the economy must serve people and the environment. An economy which destroys people and the environment is not a good economy. We must redefine our economic activities in this broader context. Parliament has made a number of proposals about what is needed: the creation of the right basic conditions, regulation, but also marketable instruments, which will help the economies in our countries to bring in private capital, and the management of natural capital in order to prevent it from being overused and to intervene when ecosystems are exploited. The balance sheet for our activities is the gross domestic product or GDP. We know that GDP is no longer adequate, because it does not tell the whole truth about our activities from an environmental and social perspective. This is why we believe that the leitmotif for the next few years, for the next decade, must be a sustainable economy, a low-carbon, resource-efficient economy. We know that people all over the world do not have fair access to resources. We see large estates being bought up and in many countries, including in Africa, there is the risk that people will no longer be able to cultivate their own food as a result of land theft. This is a phenomenon which we need to devote our attention to. It is clear that many people do not have access to energy. Around 2 billion people have no proper, regular energy supply, which is a huge disadvantage in terms of development. Access to water is by no means evenly distributed all over the world. I only want to mention these three issues. However, there are other obstacles which prevent people from accessing resources easily because they are poor, underprivileged or have other problems. To make sustainable development possible, we need to shift the burden of taxes paid by the citizens of our countries. Currently the major part of the tax burden relates to the work which is done and it is clear that this tax burden must be reduced and shifted from work to the consumption of natural resources and energy. This is an important subject for which we also need the support of the finance ministers and ministers of economic affairs in the Member States. I would like to say in conclusion that sustainability requires commitment from the local level through to the global level. Civil society is a very important resource. People must take part and we must involve them. The state has a job to do, but the private sector also has responsibilities. We must ensure that the private sector does more to make use of its knowledge and expertise in the service of sustainability. At a global level, we simply need better governance, a better structure, in order to organise these environmental and sustainable trends. In Rio we will be discussing whether the United Nations environment programme (UNEP) is adequate in its current form. The answer is clear: it is not. We need better structures at a global level. We in Parliament are hoping that the EU will speak with one voice. We will have a delegation in Durban and we will help to ensure that Europe sets itself a genuine target and plays a pioneering role. We need an agenda 2020 for sustainable development on this planet. Jo Leinen,

Madam President, Commissioner, we, too, welcome your communication on improving civil protection in the European Union. Citizens in Europe expect us to respond quickly and efficiently in the event of a disaster and, above all, to help each other. In the past, we have sometimes sat helpless in front of the television watching forest fires in southern Europe and asked ourselves: why are the others not helping? Your communication now represents the next step towards European solidarity and the efficient use of the capacities that we have in Europe. We have everything that we need. We really do have all of the facilities we need to deal with disasters in Europe. In that respect, this is a positive step forward. As a previous speaker said, national capacities should not be replaced by centralisation at EU level, but we do need to exploit synergies. We really do need everyone to act swiftly together. This is also urgently needed now. I also agree that we need to think more and more in terms of prevention. We need to deal in the right way with the information that we have and must not wait until a disaster has occurred. We can do a great deal with regard to flooding or potential droughts, where fires frequently break out. I am pleased that we will now organise civil protection, both in the EU and also outside the EU, in a coherent way. I agree with Mr Seeber: the areas of responsibility ought to be clear. You are responsible. You ought to accept that responsibility and not permit the areas of responsibility to be mixed up so that we no longer know who is responsible. Finally, I believe that this 24/7 preparedness must always be ensured, including at Christmas, during New Year, on public holidays, and during the summer, too. That is very important. I would like to thank Ms Gardini for her excellent report. Jo Leinen  (S&amp;D

 Madam President, Mr Søndergaard, if we have a list of 25 candidates, these candidates will clearly not all come from a single country, but from 25 countries. Each party will arrange it that way. Would you agree, therefore, that it will actually be the small countries that have the relative advantage and not the large ones? It is precisely the opposite of what you are arguing. Jo Leinen  (S&amp;D

 Madam President, 30 years after the first direct election to the European Parliament, we need a fundamental reform of the electoral system. The shortcomings of the European elections are clear. We must not stagnate, we must not stand still; instead, we must take the next step forward. The next step is indeed this strategic instrument of European lists alongside the national lists. Democracy involves discourse and deliberation, as Professor Habermas used to say. That is exactly our problem. The political class has a national system of discourse. The debates remain in the national realm. We have no overarching European debate, no European political realm, and the European lists would force the political class to come together and to think in European terms, to argue from a European point of view and also to make the alternatives clear to citizens with regard to the forms of Europe they have to choose from in the elections. I hope that we will succeed in implementing these European lists with your report, Mr Duff. We need this vision, and we should not give in. Parliament has already taken a decision in this regard once before, and we cannot be less ambitious than our predecessors. Jo Leinen  (S&amp;D

 Mr President, Mr Dalli, ladies and gentlemen, Europe’s response to genetically modified (GM) crops is different from that of North and South America. We know that GM crops are widely grown not only in the USA and Canada, but also in Argentina and Brazil. However, Eurobarometer surveys show that the opinions of the large majority of the people of Europe on this subject range from scepticism to opposition. For this reason, it would be wrong for Brussels to force the Member States to accept GM crops. It would not be the right thing to do and it would not be accepted. I believe that Parliament and the Commission are moving towards transferring the responsibility and the competence for this area to the Member States. Each country must decide for itself whether or not it wants to introduce genetically modified plants into the environment. It is rather regrettable that we do not have unity within Europe, but that is the reality of the situation. I think that this approach is the right one because the countries which do not want genetically modified organisms (GMOs) should not be forced to use them. Now we need legal certainty concerning the grounds on which GMOs can be opposed. The Commission has referred to some of the reasons, but these are not enough. A number of gaps remain. Mrs Lepage’s report fills precisely these gaps in the environmental aspects. We have totally different ecosystems and different approaches to the environment. This report is definitely a step in the right direction and I hope it is successful. We will be supporting it in any case. What we also need is freedom of choice for farmers and for consumers. Mr Dalli, we urgently need a regulation concerning the distance between GMO fields and conventional crops. First of all, though, Mrs Lepage’s report must achieve a majority in plenary tomorrow. Jo Leinen  (S&amp;D

 Mr President, I would like to inform the House that voting in favour of the first part of the next amendment would mean voting against the energy and climate package of 2008. We have a lot of studies from the Commission showing that fulfilling the climate package means a 25 % reduction, so I would like to ask the House to vote against this amendment. Jo Leinen  (S&amp;D
). 
 – (DE)
 Madam President, Mr Oettinger, ladies and gentlemen, the Group of the Progressive Alliance of Socialists and Democrats in the European Parliament supports Mr Eickhout’s report because it sends out a strong message both internally and externally that we are not giving up on combating climate change. It is an internal signal that we are taking seriously the promise made in the 2008 climate package of 20% renewable energy and 20% energy savings. Mr Oettinger, you have presented us with a proposal today and we have a great deal of work ahead of us. Both of these measures together will result in a 25% reduction in CO2
 emissions within the EU. Who could be opposed to this? It is not possible, because it is a package of legislation which we have adopted. In addition, we have a responsibility to the rest of the world. We also have to achieve a level of 5% clean development mechanisms (CDMs). That makes a total of 30%. I hope that this will not be watered down. The amendment to paragraph 3 would destroy the entire report. If this amendment is passed, we will be voting against the report tomorrow. I hope that this will not be the case, because we need to send out a strong signal. Jo Leinen  (S&amp;D
). - 
 Madam President, on a point of order, we are holding a debate now with the Commissioner, not a debate amongst ourselves and amongst the political groups. I think, under the Rules, we have one blue card and not six or seven. Jo Leinen  (S&amp;D

 – (DE) 
Madam President, Mr Oettinger, the stress tests are necessary and also long overdue. It is surprising that they have not been carried out before. You should take the credit for the fact that all the nuclear power stations in the EU are finally going to be inspected. However, we must admit that we are skating on very thin ice with these stress tests. You have rightly said that several countries were not prepared to take part in a European inspection procedure. Of course, there is the risk that the inspection will differ from country to country. Some will not want to include aircraft crashes and others will only open up a part of their plants for stress tests. You need to make sure that the tests are genuinely comprehensive. It is also clear that you have not made a comprehensive evaluation. The area of human failure is incomplete. The risk now and in future is not that an aircraft will accidentally crash on a nuclear power plant, but that there will be targeted attacks on these plants from outside. That is precisely what is not being tested. I live on the border with France and Luxembourg and there are four nuclear power stations in Cattenom. We have been told that the fire service and the police are responsible for them. I imagine that al-Qaeda and other terrorists will almost die laughing when they find out that the fire service and the police are responsible for preventing the threat of terrorism. This really must be included in the stress test. Finally, what will the consequences be if you find errors and weak points? There is the risk that we will not be able to do anything at a European level and that it will all come to nothing. Will some of the power plants really be shut down or modernised? It is high time that the Euratom Treaty was revised. This situation, where we have no influence over the safety of nuclear power stations, cannot continue. Jo Leinen  (S&amp;D
).

 Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, farmers can be compensated, but human life cannot be recovered. Indeed, our sympathy goes out to all those who have died or are lying in a hospital bed. This situation is dramatic and it is also unacceptable. It is unacceptable that three weeks after the outbreak of this crisis, we still do not know exactly where the pathogen that caused the crisis originated. That really should not happen in Europe. There are several lessons we need to learn from this. Firstly, we need to look for the source and examine whether improper practices are still present in the food production sector or in the food supply chain. We have legislation that has been in place for 20 years, and the standards and codes of practices in the European Union are quite stringent, but it is clear that we are still vulnerable when it comes to foodstuffs. There still seem to be gaps and shortcomings and we need to learn from this once again. I also think that the communication on this matter has been chaotic. Facts about this matter are not communicated well or in the right way. We clearly need more Europe. That has already been said by other Members here. When any regional or national authority issues a warning for the whole of Europe, it can only be a disaster. In my view, the European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control (ECDC) has done a good job, as far as I can see, but we need a better, modern reporting obligation for determining the causes and also a better system for informing the general public. Jo Leinen,  
rapporteur.

 Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, today we are debating, and tomorrow we will adopt, European legislation that, on first impression, seems rather unremarkable, but with this law on European environmental economic accounts, we are probably opening a new chapter in the measurement of progress and prosperity. We have known for a long time that gross national product is inadequate. The purely quantitative view of economic activity says nothing about the environmental balance sheet, nor about the social balance sheet, and therefore it is high time that we measured whether, year on year, we are doing well or badly in terms of our measures and efforts. We have monthly statistics relating to our labour market figures and we have annual statistics relating to our economic figures. We therefore know exactly what is happening in these areas. However, we have an incomplete patchwork of data on the environmental impact. This law on environmental economic accounts is intended to help us to draw up an accurate balance sheet in the 27 Member States and to establish whether we are making progress or, as is often the case, whether we are going backwards. As long ago as 2002, Parliament called for reliable information to be collected on the state of the environment and the most important trends in, influences on, and causes of, environmental change, and for the public to be informed of these things. We want a scientifically sound concept for measuring the consumption of resources to enable appropriate political decisions to be taken. We are pleased that the Commission took this legislative initiative in April 2010, but in our opinion, it was much too tentative in the way it went about it. We in Parliament and all of the groups have called for this to be done much more quickly, because the Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD) and the United Nations have already been discussing these matters for 15 years. This is taking far too long. We have therefore made considerable progress in the negotiations with the Council. It was a very difficult situation in the Council, because some Member States do not produce an environmental balance sheet and we first need to create a foundation in all 27 Member States. The Commission proposed the inclusion of three modules. These modules are air emissions – in this regard, we are very well aware of which gases are emitted into the air. Then there is the financial expenditure arising from environmental taxes and environmental charges. Thirdly, there are the year-on-year national material flows, the input and output, measured in purely quantitative terms. This is a start, perhaps, but it is too simple a start, and Parliament has called for us also to produce water, energy and waste balance sheets and to find out about the status of our forests. These are the modules that we urgently want to see in the very near future. There was disagreement about whether statistics can also be produced for the marine environment, in other words, statistics on the status of fish stocks. In this regard, our methodology is probably still in need of improvement. Thus, we have achieved improvements in this area. In two years’ time – by 2013 at the latest – the Commission is to present a report and, where possible, also propose a revision of this directive. I hope that, at the end of this decade, we will have a green national product in addition to the gross national product. That is our goal. Jo Leinen,  
rapporteur.
 – (DE)
 Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, thank you for the debate. I see broad support for the creation of environmental balance sheets in the European Union. With a few exceptions, this has found favour here. I also agree with Mrs Kadenbach’s statement. Many of us thought that this was already in place, and we were surprised to find that a lot of data does not exist at all, and that in the statements we make with regard to the state of the environment in the European Union, we are therefore actually completely blind. One Member, Mr Gerbrandy, said that measurement brings knowledge. We then know something, and knowledge is the basis for taking measures and for all of our programmes. We quite simply need a better basis for the decisions that we take. These environmental accounts can help us in this regard. Of course, we have the EU 2020 strategy, in which sustainability is a planning goal. I hope that in the next few years, we will also have this basis so that in 2020, we will be able to see whether we were successful or not. We know that gross domestic product provides no information on the state of the natural world and the environment, on resources that we have used, or on the whole sustainability problem. That is why this is now necessary. We are also tackling this in stages. Mrs Klaß, we are not making excessive demands; rather, the modules are to be expanded gradually. After all, as the Commissioner said, the individual pieces of legislation – the water legislation, waste legislation and clean air legislation – already contain the requirement to collect this data. Europe is also under a global obligation, Mr Nuttall. If we sign the Convention on Biological Diversity, the Convention on Climate Change or any other convention, we must be able to tell the rest of the world whether we have done well or badly. Thus, all in all, I would like to thank the shadow rapporteurs and also Eurostat, which will subsequently have to carry out the work. I hope that the necessary resources will be available in Luxembourg, because without funds, without resources, this balance sheet cannot, of course, be produced. Parliament should also help out in this regard. Thank you very much. This is an important political matter – as some people have rightly recognised – and it is a new chapter in the consideration of what we do in Europe year in year out. Jo Leinen,

 Madam President, Mrs Győri, Mr Dalli, ladies and gentlemen, I have been involved in many negotiation processes here in Parliament, but the 12 hours of this conciliation procedure, which lasted from 19:00 to 07:00 the next morning, will remain in my memory for a long time. This was a very special event. Unfortunately, the two sides came from different planets. Parliament’s approach was clear, which was to focus on the interests of consumers and of the citizens of the EU. Others were considering the interests of the meat and agriculture industries. Because of these divergent approaches, we were not able to reach an agreement. This is a pity, because we now have a gap in the EU food legislation which we need to close very quickly. We were all relatively clear about this, including Mr Pittella, who acted as chair, and the rapporteur. The entire team was pulling together. Now we need to take the next step. We must fill this gap. Mr Dalli, you must present two proposals: one on novel foods, because we have almost reached a consensus on this with regard to nanomaterials, the centralised approval process and imports from third countries. The other proposal concerns cloning. You have listened to everything that we have to say on this subject. We do not want these products on the European market. At the very least, we want them to be labelled, because consumers should have freedom of choice. That is your job and Parliament is ready to support you. I hope you will be able to submit a proposal very soon. Jo Leinen,

 Mr President, Mr Oettinger, ladies and gentlemen, I would like to thank Mr Sonik for triggering this debate and for preparing the oral question. I agree that we should never forget the Chernobyl disaster. We are well aware that the long-term consequences of the catastrophe are still being experienced a full quarter century later. There is still a large uninhabitable area, so that people can no longer return to their homes. Then there is the long-term impact on health. Television has shown us that women still suffer miscarriages 25 years after the disaster. Europe shares some of the responsibility because the issue of nuclear safety is not a matter of national sovereignty, but rather one of European responsibility. On this densely populated continent, every nuclear power plant has consequences for neighbouring countries. It is for this reason, Mr Oettinger, that you have particular responsibility for ensuring that we get to grips with this topic, especially in the light of what has happened in Fukushima. Later on we are going to talk with you about the stress tests, in other words the safety analyses for the 143 nuclear power plants. I would encourage you to stick to your principles. We want the highest possible safety standard in Europe, not just investigations into natural disasters. Accordingly we must also investigate other risks, such as plane crashes, terrorist attacks, computer attacks, in other words this combination of attacks on nuclear power plants; what is more, you must guarantee that this does not become simply a token gesture. There is still a great deal to be done in Chernobyl. The sarcophagus is not yet safe, which is why new financial resources are required to put this in order. I have not yet heard any plans for what to do with the nuclear waste lying about the site; the disposal of this material is not yet assured. Accordingly I believe, Mr Reul, that research studies are necessary because we do not have enough experience with the long-term effects of radiation. I would encourage the Commission to put such studies in motion. In the final analysis, the safest option is the nuclear exit strategy. As we continue to cooperate with the affected countries, my greatest wish is that we should establish workshops for future technology there, and provide advice on how to save energy and develop alternative energy sources. This is precisely what is needed 25 years after Chernobyl. (The speaker agrees to take a question in accordance with Rule 149(8) of the Rules of Procedure.) Jo Leinen  (S&amp;D

 – (DE)
 Mr President, I would like to thank Mr Rübig for his question. The aim must be to establish a European competence for monitoring nuclear power stations. If an issue has an impact that goes beyond national borders, then this involves a European dimension, which also requires a European competence. Mr Oettinger, we do not yet have this competence, however you must do all you can to ensure that we are given the basis to monitor nuclear plants independently and objectively from a European perspective, enabling us to draw our own conclusions when weaknesses are pinpointed. If the stress test shows that a power plant is unsafe, then it must be shut down or, if possible, upgraded. Jo Leinen  (S&amp;D
). 
 – (DE)
 Mr President, you have heard what the Chair of the Committee on Industry, Research and Energy has said. Now I am speaking as Chair of the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Food Safety and the differences could not be greater. The fact that we need the highest safety levels for all nuclear power plants goes without saying. We all agree on that. Mr Oettinger, your stress test is an important first step, but it does not go nearly far enough. I also believe that we need to rethink our approach and come up with a new one which goes into greater depth and is far more fundamental. This is why, in addition to the highest safety standards in the EU, we also need an exit scenario from a risky technology, which we cannot justify using on the densely populated continent of Europe. Mr Reul, you and others will simply have to go along with this. Your colleagues in Berlin have made much more progress than you have here in Strasbourg and in Brussels. They have probably reached the turning point, while you are still stuck with your old ideas. I hope that we can come up with a formulation, a scenario and a strategy for exiting from nuclear power. Mr Oettinger, the road map which you are producing in June of this year would be a wonderful opportunity to achieve this. After the stress tests, you must also give us your idea of how we can get out of nuclear technology. (Applause) Jo Leinen  (S&amp;D

 Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, the Treaty of Lisbon, on which work went on for so long, had two clear messages: firstly, the strengthening of the Community method with a central role for the Commission and, secondly, the strengthening of democracy with the participation of the European Parliament. Little more than a year after the entry into force of the Treaty, the spirit of Lisbon is already being ignored and ridden roughshod over. What the European Council has devised with this revision of the Treaty is unequivocally contrary to both of these messages of the Treaty of Lisbon. The Community method is not being strengthened – instead, what we have is renationalisation, intergovernmentalisation, in an important area of future EU policy and the complete exclusion of the bodies of the EU. That is unacceptable and Parliament actually has to be opposed to this proposal. It amazes me that the Commission, as guardian of the Treaties, has not spoken up more clearly and that we here in Parliament have to act, to some extent, as representatives of the Commission. We must push the Commission into action that it should already have taken. A dangerous precedent is being set here. We are observing as a result of the economic crisis that monetary union cannot exist alone. Given the influx of refugees from North Africa and the uncertainty in our neighbourhood, we are seeking additional EU policies and we do not want renationalisation. I hope that the rapporteurs can still make improvements as otherwise, I cannot vote in favour of this revision of the Treaty. Jo Leinen  (S&amp;D

 Mr President, the first energy summit in the history of the European Union will take place on Friday, because, with the entry into force of the Treaty of Lisbon, the Union has direct responsibilities in this sector for the first time. I agree with Mr Barroso that energy policy may be the European Union’s next big integration project. There are very many aspects to this, and President Buzek has always said that we need an energy community in the EU. Where this summit was concerned, there were many hopes and expectations that the European Union’s strategic questions with regard to energy supply would be answered. What are the strategic questions? Yes, Mr Saryusz-Wolski, they include the EU’s dependence on energy imports. They include the enormous amount of energy that is still being wasted, and there are also the negative consequences of the current energy system on ecosystems and in particular on the Earth’s atmosphere. When I look at the Council conclusions, I have to say that this energy summit is going to be a huge disappointment, because it will not answer any of these major questions. It has actually been poorly prepared in terms of the common vision that we need and it has also been poorly prepared in terms of the coherence of the resources and instruments that we use. I would like mention once again that yesterday, at the alternative energy summit of the Group of the Progressive Alliance of Socialists and Democrats in the European Parliament, a five pillar concept was proposed for how we can answer these strategic questions, how we can reduce energy imports and energy wastage and, of course, how we can eliminate the negative impact on the environment. The proposed means for achieving this were through the development of renewable energies, through energy efficiency and through the use of information technology to interlink these different energy sources. That is an innovation summit. I have not heard of information technology being used as a strategic factor before. I therefore believe that we need a technological revolution, and this summit ought to be setting us on the right course. However, I have the impression that it is going in the wrong direction.

Madam President, I am pleased to be able to speak after my successor on the Committee on Constitutional Affairs, because I supported this project for 10 years and the European citizens’ initiative was included in the text of the treaty almost at the last second. Back then, it was the Members of this Parliament and of the national parliaments who took the initiative in the Convention. This opens a new chapter in the relationships between the citizens and the European institutions. All of us hope that this will reduce the distance between people and politics in Europe. The citizens’ initiative is not the cure for all our ills, but it can be a huge help. Above all, I would like to see more openness in Europe, in the form of a cross-border debate on current issues which are of interest to citizens. In my area, the environment, I can think of a number of subjects which could be put on the European Union’s agenda using this instrument and, in particular, on the agenda of the Commission in its role as European government or executive. I would also like to ask the Commission how it is preparing for these future initiatives. We must not disappoint the people. I would like to thank everyone and especially the rapporteurs Mrs Gurmai and Mr Lamassoure for their excellent work. Jo Leinen,

 Mr President, we would like to thank the Commission and the Council, Mrs Hedegaard and Mrs Schauvliege, for the daily briefings that the European Parliament delegation received in Cancún. We can truly say that, in Cancún, the EU was not part of the problem but, in many cases, was part of the solution. That should please all of us. The positive mood must now be utilised to bring new momentum to climate policy in Europe and also to the European Union. I would just like to mention three points. It was absolutely right for Parliament, in its resolution, to call for us to raise our ambitions and achieve a reduction in CO2
 of 30% by 2020, and I hope that the Commission and the Council will adopt decisions on this in the spring. Secondly, we have the Green Climate Fund. We proposed the introduction of a financial transaction tax to finance this. The people who rejected this must now come up with alternatives – we can no longer beat about the bush. Thirdly, we must do our homework. We must take the hot air out of the EU’s carbon footprint. My final point is this: This climate conference is done. Now let us look to the next one. The work must now be stepped up. Jo Leinen  (S&amp;D
). 
 – (DE) 
Mr President, Mrs Schauvliege, Commissioner, I am concerned that we are going from one extreme to the other. Prior to Copenhagen we were perhaps too ambitious, and now, ahead of Cancún, I am concerned that we are not being ambitious enough. I therefore think it is good that, in its resolution, Parliament addresses all the issues that we believe to be necessary for there to be progress and for us to achieve results even in Cancún. We have one major demand, and that is that the EU switch its strategy. Prior to Copenhagen, we made ourselves dependent on what was done in the United States and perhaps on what was done in China. That did not work there and it will not work in Cancún either. We should therefore take climate protection measures to protect our own interests. Hence the call by the majority in committee, and I hope in plenary tomorrow too, for us to increase our targets from 20% to 30%. That will be necessary during the course of the process in any case. We need to achieve this target at least before we go to South Africa. I also think that we are still on the wrong track with regard to Kyoto. Here too, we are relying on everyone else. I believe that our offer should be to establish Kyoto II. We will have no problem doing this; we will achieve it. Finally, with regard to the EU speaking with one voice: I saw how this worked in Nagoya. We had one microphone for the EU. Different people could speak, but they had to convey the same message. That is what I would like to see from the Council and the Commission in Cancún, too. Jo Leinen,  
on behalf of the S&amp;D Group.

Madam President, I hope that our Commissioner gets his voice back again, because we need a voice at the climate conference in Cancún. I had been rather surprised that Mrs Damanaki was speaking here on the revision of the hazardous substances directive after also speaking on the fisheries revisions; thank you for stepping into the breach. Parliament has not got everything that it wanted. Annex 3 has been dropped, which we regret. However, we will continue to keep an eye on these substances and when the revision takes place in three years’ time, you will have to come back to this House with your impact assessments and provide evidence of the problems that exist there on a substance-by-substance basis. We also have a considerable number of exemptions, so that it rather resembles a Swiss cheese. We also need to check here the gaps and shortcomings that exist as regards human health and the environment. I will simply say that solar panels were highly controversial. We want to keep cadmium out of the environment, but these panels put 100 000 tonnes of cadmium into the environment. That is something we will have to watch carefully. I am pleased that the Commission has made some concessions with its four statements, so for now, we will take what progress has been made in 2010 and we will meet again in three years’ time for the revision. Naturally, I would also like to thank the rapporteurs and shadow rapporteurs. Jo Leinen,

 Madam President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, the Gulf of Mexico has probably suffered one of the biggest environmental disasters of recent years, and we in Europe – in the European Union – must do everything we can to ensure that such a disaster cannot happen here. I believe we are in agreement on that. We have four seas adjoining the EU or situated within the EU: the North Sea, the Baltic Sea, the Mediterranean and the Black Sea. Oil drilling takes place in these European waters. In this regard, the subject is also an issue for the European Union. Deep-sea drilling especially represents a particular risk. That has become evident from the oil well in the Gulf of Mexico. There are problems here that are beyond our control. A great many outstanding questions have arisen to which we still do not have answers. Ladies and gentlemen, Commissioner, that is why we are recommending to you in our resolution that it would be appropriate to have a moratorium at least on new applications for deep-sea drilling until such time as we have a complete overview of what is needed and how we can close the gaps and remedy the shortcomings. I believe that the citizens of Europe expect us to ensure an equally high level of security for all 27 Member States, and thus for all four seas of the EU, and that there is no gap between countries that are already doing a lot – and that should be recognised – and those that are perhaps somewhat more lax in this area. I am also addressing our neighbouring countries here. We have a Neighbourhood Policy, and in the Mediterranean, in particular, there are, of course, also drillings by countries that are not members of the European Union. Commissioner Oettinger, I believe you are taking initiatives – and that is something you must indeed do – to talk to Libya in particular, but also to others, concerning our standards and our approaches. The question is: would the EU be prepared for such a disaster? What control mechanisms and intervention mechanisms do we have in the event of such a disaster? We need answers to this too. We have the agency in Lisbon, the European Maritime Safety Agency (EMSA), which was established in the aftermath of a disaster involving the break-up of supertankers. The agency thus checks the safety of vessels, but not the safety of the seas – in other words, precisely what we have now seen in respect of deep-sea drilling. In our opinion, it would be a good idea to expand EMSA’s mandate to allow these things also to come within its remit. That would at least address the problem adequately. I imagine that new resources would be needed for this. That is always a problem, of course. However, if we want to deal with such a major issue, then the resources will have to be found. I would also like to mention liability for such major events. What, in fact, is the insurance situation? What possibilities are there for getting the funds needed? We need to gain an overview of liability and insurance law relating to deep-sea drilling, and that is something we are discussing. Naturally we also, and above all, need to see how this applies to small companies operating in this field. Not all the companies active in this area are multinationals; there are many small companies too. How will they manage? How can they insure themselves? Do we need solidarity funds? Do we need collective solutions to ensure that those who suffer are compensated – the fishermen and others who are affected by such disasters? We also want to know whether the Environmental Impact Assessment Directive, which demands environmental impact assessments for activities on land, also applies to deep-sea drilling and related areas. There is much we do not know about the high seas. What kind of working conditions and social standards are effective there? After all, the human factor can also play a major role. We have good technology, but if the human factor fails, then it could result in such disasters. Commissioner, you have overall responsibility for energy. Offshore oil has its problems; offshore wind would be better. I believe that this debate naturally opens the way for a different energy policy in the EU – and that also lies within your remit.

 Mr President, Mr Tajani, ladies and gentlemen, along with industrial chemicals and agricultural chemicals, household chemicals represent the third large group of substances which are of significance for the environment and human health, and we are introducing rules covering these products in the biocide regulation. I believe that we have made significant progress since the old directive which dates back to 1998. Other speakers have already mentioned this. We are introducing a comprehensive regulation which applies not only to products manufactured in the EU, but also to imported products. This is very important. We are improving the labelling of these substances and, as Mr Jørgensen has said, we are calling for animal testing of these products to be replaced with alternative methods. We want to see animal tests reduced to a minimum or even abolished altogether in this area. In addition, we want particularly hazardous substances to be replaced with substances which are less dangerous. All of these measures represent progress and we can explain to the citizens of Europe that they will benefit human health and the environment. I was surprised about the level of disagreement as to whether or not the European Chemicals Agency (ECHA) in Helsinki should be responsible for monitoring and authorising these products. We want the same standards to apply throughout Europe and we want it to be possible for these products to be sold on the European market. For this reason, it is right that the ECHA takes responsibility for this area. I would like to ask Mr Tajani whether the ECHA has sufficient funding and the right organisation to be able to take on this task. My thanks go to Mrs Klaß and to the shadow rapporteurs for achieving a consensus on this subject. Jo Leinen,

 Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, I am not going to point the finger at any particular country, but I believe the finger is pointing back at all of us, because the EU strategy for 2010 has not worked and we need to think of new approaches for the new decade leading up to 2020. In a few weeks, the UN Conference of the Parties to the Convention on Biological Diversity will take place in Nagoya, and I hope that it will not be a similar disappointment to the UN Climate Change Conference in Copenhagen. At such an important global nature conservation conference, there simply must not be another failure, and the EU must play a major role in ensuring that is the case. We need to push for an ambitious global programme for the preservation of biodiversity. We must show solidarity in the financing of these measures, and the EU must speak with one voice and not 27 different ones. The Economics of Ecosystems and Biodiversity (TEEB) study has been mentioned. EUR 50 billion is lost each year as a result of species decline. In this case, 0.2% of financial resources from the EU budget for nature conservation is very meagre and paltry. In the medium-term financial programme, we simply must be provided with more money for the conservation of species. As far as the solidarity of the EU with the rest of the world is concerned, we also need an instrument that we can use to provide something in return for the species that we remove, particularly for medicinal plants. Developing countries need compensation. I also believe that the key to success lies in viewing biodiversity as a cross-cutting task. Agriculture, forestry, fisheries, marine exploitation – these now all need to be viewed from a species perspective. A soil protection directive will also gain a new importance. The soil is a buffer for CO2
, and changes to the soil represent a very negative scenario. Parliament will stand up for biodiversity. Congratulations to the rapporteur. Jo Leinen,  
on behalf of the S&amp;D Group.

Madam President, this disaster happened off the coast of the US, not the EU. It therefore affords us a real opportunity to learn some lessons and draw some conclusions. Mr Oettinger said that this is the second time we have discussed this issue. My committee has also held a major debate, and I am thankful to you that as soon as next week, together with the coordinators of the Committee on Industry, Research and Energy and the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Food Safety, we shall learn the results of your analysis, enabling us to continue our work into the summer recess. I would support you on the imposition of a moratorium on extreme drilling in Europe. We need to wait until we have identified the problems. I would also support your call for European standardisation, stringent safety standards and a European supervisory authority. As you have said, what we need is a system for auditing the auditors. I like this idea a lot. We would be happy to work on this. Mrs Damanaki, I liked what I heard from you: this disaster must spur us to change. The integrated maritime policy you have called for is a major project for the EU. I believe that harnessing the renewable energy of the sea, whether through deep-sea currents or other forms of retrieval that are yet to be invented, is a really key issue. I believe that the institutions, including the Council, have demonstrated a determination to prevent such a disaster in Europe, as has Parliament, and will be happy to cooperate with you in avoiding such an eventuality. Jo Leinen  (S&amp;D

 Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, a similar picture seems to be emerging from within all the groups. We had an interesting debate too on this regulation, which was also filled with controversy. However, the large majority of us feel that we will vote tomorrow with the rapporteur and give a clear signal to the Commission and Council. Commissioner, I believe that you said that we have a consensus. With novel foods, we need prior authorisation before they enter the market. I also explicitly agree that we need a central authorisation procedure and not different authorisation procedures in 27 Member States. This would not conform to the concept of the internal market and the uniformity of health and living conditions. We have new technologies entering the food market – as has already been mentioned in this Chamber – such as nanotechnology and GMOs. We are adopting a cautious approach in this House until we know all the facts and can be sure that our citizens can buy food which is totally safe in our supermarkets and then eat it afterwards. We are not calling for a ban on GMOs and nanomaterials. We want consumers to be given the freedom of choice or, in other words, a label indicating if these materials are contained in the food. I hope that during its cross-section debate on nanomaterials next week, the Commission will also reach a definition and perhaps a regulation so that we can have more material available about how we should handle nanomaterials. A great deal has already been said about meat from cloned animals. I would like you, Commissioner, to remove this section from the novel foods regulation. This would pave the way for a regulation on all the other topics which are not controversial. However, I would still call for a decision to be made about a separate regulation for meat from cloned animals before the conciliation procedure has ended, and to remove this from the novel foods regulation.

 Mr President, Commissioner Potočnik has thanked this Parliament emphatically for the fact that we have stayed so hard-headed with this legislative package, and that we have contributed to the big push forward that will now take place on the prevention of air pollution. The thanks for this must, of course, go to our rapporteur, Mr Krahmer, for his excellent work, but also to all the shadow rapporteurs and the others who stayed with us on this objective to make Europe’s air cleaner. The European Environment Agency has given us a report which shows that in some areas, we still have a bad situation as regards air pollution, nitrogen oxides and dust. Commissioner, you said it yourself. Now we hope that, with this new amendment, you will also have a tool for carrying out controls. We hope that you will also really implement this in a hard-headed manner and not accept any major exemptions or time wasting. After all, the previous directive dates from 1996 – that is, 14 years ago! I can understand the new Member States such as Poland and others, but I cannot understand the old Member States at all – the fact that in all these years, so little has been done, and the arguments that we hear again in this instance too, with regard to jobs and costs. Well, of course, these things always turn out badly; if we wait too long, then everything comes at once. If we do our work on time, then we can also carry out innovations and still protect jobs. Thus we have a great success, though it is spoiled somewhat by the large combustion plants. The small fry are arrested, while the big fish are allowed to go free. What happens so often in life is also unfortunately happening here with industrial plants. Jo Leinen,  
rapporteur for the opinion of the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Food Safety.

 Mr President, Mr Kallas, ladies and gentlemen, transport policy is of great importance when it comes to protecting both the environment and people’s health. It is good that the European Union has a strategy covering the period up to 2020 in order to resolve the many problems in current transport systems. We need to see a significant reduction in the environmental impact of road transport. We need genuine innovations in this area to reduce CO2
 emissions and also nitrogen oxides and fine particulates. In addition, we must integrate air and sea transport more closely into our environmental strategy. In particular, in the case of sea transport, sulphur and nitrogen oxide emissions are rising, and improvements are needed in this area. The increase in the noise produced by transport is also a nuisance for millions of people, which impacts on their quality of life. Improvements must be made in road transport, but also in rail and air transport. I would like to mention the internalisation of external costs. Company cars bring tax benefits and the airline industry does not pay excise duty on fuel, which means that we still have a great deal to do in this area. I would like to congratulate Mr Grosch on his excellent report. Jo Leinen,

 Madam President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, our group welcomes the statement by the Commission that we will fight to maintain the moratorium on commercial whaling. Now it is up to the Council to confirm this statement and, above all, to ensure that the 27 Member States speak with one voice. We cannot afford to delay this. We know from the meeting of the environment ministers that we do not have agreement here. There are some individual Member States that are pursuing different interests to the vast majority. Now that we have the Treaty of Lisbon, we ought to get used to the fact that we also speak with one voice in our foreign policy and in the representation of our values and interests in international organisations and not, as was the case in the past, each Member State for itself, which ultimately resulted in the weakening of Europe. We have seen this already at the CITES Conference. Here, our lack of agreement was ultimately a kind of powerlessness. We did not achieve what we wanted. I would not like this to continue in the International Whaling Commission. 2010 is the International Year of Biodiversity; in other words, the protection of ecosystems and threatened animal and plant species will be right at the centre of our efforts during these months. It would be a very bad sign if, in the Whaling Commission of all places, the moratorium was lifted and commercial whaling was permitted once again. We know that this animal species remains vulnerable. Our seas are becoming increasingly polluted and climate change will place yet another new strain on them. We therefore need to be very careful in our approach to this subject. The commercial interests of Japan, Iceland and Norway cannot take precedence here. Protection of this species and its ecosystems must determine our path. We are seeing the abuse of the concept of ‘scientific hunting’. Japan is clearly killing 900 whales a year in the Antarctic Ocean under the concept of ‘scientific whaling’. That is blatant abuse and I fully support the concerns of the Australian Government, which also no longer wants to permit this. We should do what the Commission has proposed in this regard. We call on the Council to create unity here so that we will speak with one voice at the forthcoming meeting of the International Whaling Commission. Jo Leinen,  
on behalf of the S&amp;D Group.

 Mr President, we do not need to take a detour with regard to this vote. We can decide directly. The Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Food Safety has recommended that plenary bans the sticking together of separate pieces of meat and therefore does not allow thrombin to be used as an additive. A steak must be a steak and a ham must be a ham. I am sure that this is what the constituents of all the Members of this House want. Therefore, please vote in favour of our amendment not to include thrombin as an additive in our food regulation. Jo Leinen  (S&amp;D

 Mr President, the theme of the Lisbon Strategy was competitiveness and it was a very strongly one-sided economic strategy, which, of course, in part has failed. I am therefore very pleased that the theme of the EU 2020 strategy is now sustainability. That is the right way to go and it also involves a better balance between economic, social and environmental developments and needs. The disadvantage of sustainability is that it is a very general concept that can also lack substance. We therefore need to make it more specific. In this regard, the Commission’s paper is much too vague, as there are too many pieces of the picture missing to allow us to implement it. A resource-efficient Europe is the right approach – we have meagre energy reserves and meagre raw material reserves – but there is a lack of targets and instruments to bring us to this point of resource efficiency in our production and in our consumption. In this regard, I hope that by June we will have something rather more tangible and that we will know precisely what each of us has to do – what the Commission will do, what Parliament will do and what the Member States will have to do. In relation to this resource-efficient Europe, the environment seems to have been somewhat forgotten, because air, water, land and also ecosystems are resources too. That has been completely lost. I would therefore like to hear more from the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Food Safety in respect of what we want to do in this regard. The biodiversity strategy has failed. A new one has, of course, been drawn up to take us to 2020 and this point must be taken into account in this strategy. Climate protection has certainly been tossed about many times. I believe that we need to increase our reduction target from 20% to 30% and we need mandatory targets for energy efficiency. This is still too vague – we need to make it legally binding.

 Mr President, as if we had been able to predict what was going to happen, the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Food Safety, which is also responsible for civil protection, has an own-initiative report on the community approach to the prevention of natural disasters in the pipeline. The rapporteur is Mr Ferreira. We will be voting on this report in the next session and we will discuss our experience of the volcanic ash cloud then. Plenary will very soon be able to formulate Parliament’s position on these subjects. I agree with the Members who have said that we are poorly prepared for natural disasters. Fortunately, Europe has few natural disasters. However, we also have little experience in this area and it is clear that our crisis management is poor. In my opinion, it all took too long. Five days before a test flight took place and real data was collected is simply too long. We must learn from this. I do not want to make any accusations, but experience shows that we must do things better the next time around. If this volcanic ash has made one thing clear, it is the need for more Europe. Mr Kallas, you have said that the national authorities have responsibilities. However, this does not help the people who have suffered as a result. We need more Europe in civil protection and in a common transport policy. The Treaty of Lisbon opens up more opportunities for us. In the same way as Mrs Hübner, I would like to ask you how you will make use of the opportunities afforded by the Treaty of Lisbon in crisis management and civil protection. This situation must improve. Jo Leinen,  
rapporteur for the opinion of the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Food Safety.

 Madam President, Commissioner, the European Parliament has been waiting for this moment for a long time, namely for Parliament to be on an equal footing with the Council with respect to the control of legislative delegation. To illustrate this point: in 2008, there were 6 000 delegated acts, in other words, a huge mountain of standards, which were turned into a kind of secondary legislation by the Commission and the old comitology procedure. Parliament had very few rights in this process. We were informed, but we were not colegislators. The Treaty of Lisbon has now changed that. With regard to the control of delegated acts, we are on an equal footing with the Council, and we also want to utilise our equal standing to the full. That means, Commissioner, that when you argue that the urgency procedure is possible, then we will also need to receive information at as early a stage as possible. We want to receive information as early as the Council receives it. Jo Leinen  (S&amp;D

 Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, the Greek crisis is a current problem, while the growth crisis and the environmental crisis are long-term problems, and both need to be tackled dynamically with decisions taken by the European Council. The Europe 2020 strategy rightly states that growth should be intelligent, sustainable and inclusive. When I look at the Council’s conclusions, however, I see that they are much more narrowly focused and reduced to the classical growth strategy – a strategy that has failed and that did not get us very far. Growth cannot be intelligent if it is not sustainable and it is also not intelligent if it is not inclusive. That is why I would like to ask the Council and the Presidency of the Council to ensure that this triad, these three pillars, are retained. This is the new development that really should be implemented now. I am very pleased that growth that saves on resources and on energy is to be a flagship of the European Union. Of course, we have been talking about this for a long time. This will actually help us to save costs, reduce dependencies and solve a series of problems. I expect the Commission to provide us with a roadmap in the course of 2010, as it is a shared responsibility of the EU itself but also of the Member States, and many areas are therefore on very soft ground and very vague. Above all, we must make the target of 20% energy savings binding. This efficiency target must thus be made legally binding so that everyone knows where things are headed and industry can also realise the relevant investment. Jo Leinen  (S&amp;D

 A very warm welcome to Parliament, Commissioner. I wrote a letter to the President of Parliament to inform him that all of the delegations in this House have climate protection on the agenda in our discussions with our partners throughout the world. We need to find another mechanism to enable this information and these results to be linked in with your travels around the world so that those of us here in Brussels and Strasbourg know exactly where we stand. I am rather concerned that the climate negotiations could suffer the same fate as the Doha negotiations, which are constantly being postponed year after year. My question is, therefore, what is your plan B in order, perhaps, to achieve results in parts of some sectors? I also have a question concerning the Kyoto Protocol. One strategic error we made in Bangkok was to give the impression that we would abandon it. What would happen if we do not adopt something until 2011 or 2012? What is the future for the Kyoto Protocol? Jo Leinen  (S&amp;D

Mr President, Commissioner, welcome to Parliament. I would like to join my fellow Member, Mr Schnellhardt, by saying you have a major task in this area, to create genuinely equal conditions in the 27 Member States by 2010 so that household pets can be transported and brought from one country to another without obstacles. Free movement for dogs and cats was certainly the goal of the 2003 regulation. Now, for the third time, we are making an exception. In the EU, some things take a really long time: ten years to tune such regulations. No country in the EU wants diseases to be introduced and I also wonder why 22 countries accept the idea of dogs and cats being allowed to travel with their owners and five countries do not. You should examine whether the reality and the obstacles still correspond to these special provisions. I know that there are thorny debates at national level, but we are now one legal space and it is time, by 2011 at the latest, to introduce free movement, the single market for pets. The animal expert, Mr Schnellhardt, has already mentioned the conditions, namely that there is a vaccination card and that instruments like electronic tagging will be used, which will then give you access to the five countries when you are on holiday or travelling to work and wish to take your pets with you. This regulation on pets will go down in history. It is, in fact, the first legal act since the Treaty of Lisbon and we wanted a level playing field with the Council of Ministers in the empowerment of the Commission for delegated acts. That was an uphill struggle, but it was worth it. My congratulations to Mrs De Brún for this report and, of course, for this procedure to begin a new era. That is why it is so important, because we have perhaps a hundred legal acts in a year, but 6 000 delegated acts, and from this we can gauge how important it is to set the new procedure on the right track from the beginning.

 Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, following the disappointing conclusion to the climate conference in Copenhagen, Parliament is using this resolution to make it clear that there is no alternative to climate protection and that, as we move towards the next conference in Mexico, we must increase rather than decrease our efforts in this area. I shall be brief. Amendment 6 from the Group of the Progressive Alliance of Socialists and Democrats in the European Parliament was intended to serve this purpose. However, as it has been worded confusingly, we are withdrawing it. Nevertheless, we do support Amendments 1 and 9 from the Group of the Alliance of Liberals and Democrats for Europe and the Group of the Greens/European Free Alliance, which call on the EU to do more en route to Mexico. Climate protection must not come to a standstill. I would ask for your support. Jo Leinen,

Madam President, Madam President-in-Office of the Council, Mr Samecki, 2010 is the International Year of Biodiversity and the EU is about to press ahead with a new strategy for biodiversity, in other words, for the protection of flora and fauna within the area of the European Union. It would greatly enhance the credibility of the European Union if we were also to work on an international level to protect endangered flora and fauna globally and to give this our support. There will be an opportunity for this next month at the 15th Conference of the Parties to the Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species of Wild Fauna and Flora (CITES) in Doha. The EU must make itself a champion for all species which, as a result of various different factors, but in particular, over-exploitation or destructive and illegal practices, are endangered or even threatened with extinction. The Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Food Safety has debated this issue in detail and will table a proposal for a recommendation in plenary tomorrow, and we would be very pleased if the Council and the Commission were able to endorse these recommendations. Due to the time constraints, I will just mention a few example species which, in our opinion, are in need of a high or an even higher level of protection. Firstly, there is the African Elephant. We are most definitely opposed to the downlisting of this animal from Appendix I to Appendix II. The prohibition of international trade, particularly in ivory, must remain in place. Secondly, there is the Asian tiger. It is now on the brink of extinction, and we are demanding stricter protection regulations for many parties to the Convention, in particular to prevent the illegal trade in the body parts and derivatives of the tiger. We know that there is a large market for tiger bones and components of the tiger in Asia and this is threatening the existence of this animal. Thirdly, there is the protection of the polar bear. Climate change is threatening to destroy the habitat of this species and there is also an increase in trade in the body parts of polar bears. We are therefore in favour of uplisting the polar bear from Appendix II to Appendix I. I would also like to mention the protection of various species of shark. Various shark species are being over-fished, in particular the porbeagle and the spiny dogfish, but other shark species are also affected by this. Up to this point, there is consensus among us. I now come to the controversial issue. The source of the controversy is the classification of the Atlantic bluefin tuna, which is found in the Mediterranean and the Atlantic. Ladies and gentlemen, we are aware of the recommendations of the ad-hoc working group of the FAO, which wants to leave the Atlantic bluefin tuna in Appendix II. However, we are also aware of the proposal by the CITES scientific committee, which wants to uplist the Atlantic bluefin tuna to Appendix I. The background to this proposal is the data which reveals what is happening with this species. The stocks of Atlantic bluefin tuna declined by 75% between 1957 and 2007, and in the last ten years alone, there has been a decline of 60.9%. The risk to this fish is increasing and gaining momentum and therefore, the vast majority of us in the committee were of the opinion that this species should be included in Appendix I. This means that there will only be restrictions and prohibitions on international fishing fleets, not local fishing. Thus, the small, local fishermen can continue to catch this fish, and the preservation of the fish in the ecosystem is, in any case, more important than the general availability of sushi and sashimi. That is the conflict that we face. We need to take a long-term view and should provide proper protection for the Atlantic bluefin tuna in Appendix I. Jo Leinen  (S&amp;D

 Mr President, Mrs Espinosa, last week I attended the Informal Environment Council meeting in Seville. It was the first Council configuration under the Spanish Presidency. You were, of course, unable to attend due to an unfortunate family matter, but your Secretary of State, Teresa Ribera, did a splendid job of representing you. Throughout the meeting, which was extremely well organised, the commitment of the Spanish Presidency to the matter was evident. That is all well and good, but the result of this Council meeting was not very satisfactory. The Council of Ministers was divided, with a complete lack of direction. There is absolutely no agreement among Member States about what we should do now. That is not a good sign. It is your job and your responsibility to find the common denominator among the 27 Member States. In my opinion, we need to do three things in the European Union following Copenhagen. The first is that we must regain the leading role in global climate protection. Secondly, we need to show credibility in the commitments that we have made and, thirdly, we urgently need to gain new partners before we get to Mexico. With regard to regaining the leading role, I agree with everyone here who said that we should continue to state our promise to reduce carbon emissions by 30%. I would like to see us specify this 30% target to the UN Secretariat in Bonn on 31 January, not the old 20% target. If we make ourselves dependent on comparable efforts by others, it will take forever and Mexico will also come to nothing. In terms of showing credibility, the EUR 7.2 billion must actually be realised before Mexico. The countries in Africa need to be able to see that the first measures are already in progress. Finally, with regard to gaining partners, I hope that we will develop climate protection diplomacy and, with the help of the African Union in particular, that we will also find sufficient partners, including in Latin America and Asia, for a global agreement in Mexico.

 Mr President, an official delegation is representing Parliament in Copenhagen. You will also be attending and, for the first time, we do not have to rent an office in the city. Instead, we will have an official presence in the EU pavilion. This is good and we are grateful. Therefore, Article 61 is not needed. The Treaty of Lisbon ensures not only that Parliament will be listened to with regard to international treaties, but also that it has to agree to them. This is the beginning of a new era for us and, therefore, we are asking, in accordance with Article 60, to be admitted to the EU coordination meetings and not to be left standing outside the door. The Commission must treat us in the same way as it does the Council when it provides information about treaty negotiations and we are asking it to begin with the Kyoto agreement. This is our request to the Commission. Perhaps Mrs Reding would like to say something on this subject. (Applause) Jo Leinen,

 Mr President, Mr President-in-Office of the Council, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, in recent years, the European Parliament has been a driving force in the debate on climate protection, and we have also achieved a large percentage of the EU’s climate protection package. The resolution that we are putting forward today has all the elements for an ambitious agreement in Copenhagen. Yet what we are proposing is also realistic. It is both ambitious and realistic at the same time, and we hope that the Council and the Commission will join forces with us to form a single lobbying body at the conference in order to get other partners on board. The EU has taken on the leadership role in these issues and we want that to remain the case in Copenhagen. We must therefore stand by our offer of a 30% reduction in CO2
 by 2020. The science tells us that we need to be in the upper end between 25% and 40%. 30% would therefore still not be enough, we know that, and that is why we must actually offer this target, as it will drive up the ambition of other countries. We know that global climate protection is not possible without financing. In contrast to the Council, Parliament has given specific figures in this regard. The global framework is around EUR 100 billion, and Europe needs to take on around a third of that. So why do we not say that we will provide EUR 30 billion in 2020? Parliament has committed itself to this and I hope that the Council and the Commission will be equally specific in two weeks time. Mrs Wortmann-Kool has already mentioned the kick-start. We need EUR 5 to 7 billion straight away. When I look at how much money we made available for the banking crisis, we are really talking about peanuts to overcome the climate crisis – and there will be no second chance at this. Once the climate has been broken, it will be broken forever and we will not be able to fix it. This really has to deserve a major effort from us all, therefore. I also note that some countries are moving, but others are not. It must not be the case that the two greatest climate polluters, China and the United States, play a giant game of ping-pong where each accuses the other whilst dragging its own feet. That is irresponsible and I hope that the US, in particular, will also show leadership in Copenhagen, with specific information on reductions in its own climate-change gases and also a share of the financing. Without these two countries and without India, there will be no agreement. We emphasise forestry policy once again – deforestation is a major factor – as well as aviation and maritime transport. If railways are included in the emissions trading and have to pay, I can no longer see why aviation and maritime transport should have such special privileges. At long last, Parliament will be represented in the EU pavilion for the first time. That is a new beginning, and I hope we are able to take part in the briefing between the Council and the Commission since, under the Treaty of Lisbon, we have joint legislative power on the Copenhagen agreement. Jo Leinen  (S&amp;D

 Mr President, the demand from Václav Klaus for an addition to the Charter of Fundamental Rights is both arbitrary and superfluous. However, it is easy to oppose, because the charter refers only to EU law and applies only to the future. Therefore, if necessary, the Council should make a political declaration. In a few weeks, the ratification of the treaty, which we have been waiting nine years for, should then take place. The European Council must make the necessary preparations, but should not jump to any hasty conclusions. This applies also to the European External Action Service. The High Representative is responsible for proposing a concept for the service, not the Council bureaucracy. I would therefore ask the Council Presidency to ensure that the service is not in a position off to one side, but can integrate itself into the community system, as Mr Barroso has said. This treaty gives us the legal basis for a common energy policy and for a common climate protection policy. I can only hope that the fog lifts before Copenhagen, because we must not leave these questions open until the conference. The Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Food Safety has made clear demands, including with regard to financing. I hope that there will be agreement on a financing concept next week at the summit. Furthermore, we need internal burden-sharing within the EU. Germany and other countries must give way, as we need a fair deal both within the EU and between the EU and the developing countries throughout the world. Jo Leinen,

Madam President, Commissioner Olli Rehn has praised this Parliament for its activities in bringing about the climate protection package and, in fact, we aim to continue to be ambitious. Last night, the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Food Safety voted 55-1 in favour of adopting a resolution that sets high targets for the negotiations in Copenhagen. This result shows that the denial of climate change, the ignorance of these matters, is represented by a vanishingly small minority of individuals here in this House whose views really should be disregarded and who have made their views known here on a number of occasions, but who are actually swimming against the tide of opinion of the citizens of all the countries of the European Union. It makes no difference to the Earth’s atmosphere where the CO2
 comes from. That means that we need a global agreement for every country and not – as is already being argued in Bangkok – multiple agreements, with one for the US, one for Europe and one for the developing countries – that would be disastrous. We need a global pact against climate change and that means that we also need a global pact of solidarity of the rich countries with the poor ones. This point has already been made many times. Climate change represents an opportunity for us and also for the developing countries to set in motion low-carbon development with new technologies, together with the modernisation of the infrastructure. Europe must help this come about. When it comes to funding, we have endorsed the demand that the EU needs EUR 30 billion by 2020 and that we must develop funding tools that are durable and predictable. They must not simply be dependent on funds from the budget, but must also have other sources of funding. I want to stress, once again, that marine transport and aviation must be included and that, of course, the forests and agriculture have their own, significant share. Development and climate protection are not opposites – rather, they must be brought together into a synthesis in Copenhagen. Jo Leinen  (S&amp;D

 Mr President, after eight years and many debates and negotiations, there is a real chance now that this Reform Treaty will enter into force, thanks also to the hard work of many people in this House who were committed to this project from beginning to end in the Convention and later in the intergovernmental conferences. I believe that Parliament has played a constructive part in this Reform Treaty. I think that, if the constitutional court in Prague in the Czech Republic gives a positive ruling, there will no longer be any legal grounds for President Klaus to block the EU any further. The other constitutional bodies in the Czech Republic will also find ways to overcome any such illegal blockade. We are, of course, hearing that there is a new threat of trouble from the United Kingdom. However, if a British Government were to allow a referendum, then it would not be on the Treaty of Lisbon but on whether the British people are in favour of the EU or whether they want to pull out of Europe. That would have to be the subject of the referendum and not a treaty that has been ratified. That would be totally unacceptable. I think we need to learn something from this, and that is that our citizens need more information. I therefore hope that, in the new Commission, we will also get a vice-president for communication and for information and perhaps even a commissioner for European citizenship. That would be the answer to these controversies on European policy. Jutta Haug  (S&amp;D

Mr President, Commissioners, ladies and gentlemen, the extraordinary meeting of the European Council is now imminent and we are talking ourselves to a standstill in an effort to achieve harmony. The extraordinary meeting has one sole purpose: to develop the Council’s mandate for the negotiations on the multiannual financial framework. As part of the preparations, two inter-related negotiating boxes have been produced. To put it bluntly, we are not satisfied, and we cannot possibly be satisfied with what has been presented. We are also annoyed, to put it mildly, by the Council’s conduct on budgetary issues, which can be described in one word: irresponsible! We can only repeat what we said in June last year, namely that we need a proper system of own resources which is worthy of the name. The Commission has taken a first small step, but this is not enough. There is almost nothing we need more urgently than these genuine own resources, for they would mean that the European budget would no longer be dependent on national contributions. We need this independence to put an end to this untenable situation. There would also be no further logic to the arguments being advanced in some Member States. As Mr Reul has just said, the debate there is only ever about payments, contributions and spending. They never discuss political priorities, their priorities. They never tell us what they would like to achieve with the European budget. No ideas are forthcoming about the future of the European Union. The Council is not acting like a European institution. Instead, it has become a collection of 27 sets of national self-interest, where they all bicker like children  The budget is like a pie, and yes, there should be pie, but they squabble over which ingredients they should provide and how big their slice of the pie should be. Everyone wants to eat and no one wants to bake. It is appalling! Jutta Haug  (S&amp;D
).  
– (DE) 
Madam President, Commissioners, ladies and gentlemen, the next multiannual financial framework and the amount of funding and the policies we want to finance are the focus of our discussions and disagreements here as we seek to reach a consensus, but this is only one side of the coin, namely the expenditure side. However, we must work on the other side of the coin as well, namely the revenue side. That is nothing new. For almost 20 years, the European Parliament has been calling for a more transparent, fairer and simpler system of own resources. Now, for the first time, we can lend weight to this demand.  In the SURE report last June, we called for a system of own resources which would abolish all of the rebates and make the revenue side of the EU budget completely independent of the contributions made by Member States. The Commission took account of these demands, at least to some extent, by proposing a reform of own resources from valued added tax and the introduction of a Financial Transaction Tax. We support this proposal by the Commission, even though it only amounts to a 40 % reform. It is at least a step forward, and what is more, it moves in the right direction.  The European Union has won the Nobel Peace Prize. This was intended to be an expression of gratitude but also an incentive to go further. A more peaceful approach could also be achieved if the constant bean-counting between the net contributors and the net recipients were consigned to the past following a reform of the revenue system. A genuinely European revenue stream would also highlight the European value added of the EU budget. Then this constant small-minded national bean-counting could finally stop. Jutta Haug,  
rapporteur for the opinion of the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Food Safety

Mr President, President of the Council, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, the Committee on the Environment would like to remind you that, although it is responsible only for an infinitesimal part of the European budget, we will certainly not achieve the aims of the Europe 2020 strategy if we do not commit sufficient appropriations to the programmes and measures relating to environment and climate action and biodiversity. That is why we have reinstated the totally incomprehensible cuts the Council made to the Commission proposal. After all, the Commission did also subscribe to the commitment to sustained growth. In any case, the Commission was already being very cautious when it drew up the budget. It provided for a rise of no more than 0.72 % for climate and environment policy. In plain words, that simply means a cut. For the inflation rate is in fact 2 %. Even more dubious is what the Council is doing with the agencies. Let us make it quite clear: the Commission has already included the minus 1 % for staff in its proposal, and, moreover, it is as usual also reducing the appropriations the agencies regard as necessary. That means the available budget for the agencies is pretty low from the outset. And then the Council comes along and snips away at it even more. Soon we will be down to the bare bones! This most affects the agencies to which the legislator, i.e. the Council and the EP together, have transferred new tasks. They cannot fulfil them if they do not receive adequate funding. We expect the Commission to produce a supplementary and rectifying budget as soon as possible in any case and at all events. We expect the Council to take on board our good arguments when it negotiates with Parliament. We know that the Council is incorruptible, but surely it can at least see reason! Jutta Haug  (S&amp;D
).  
– (DE)
 Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, in unity, strength. That is what they say. We ought not to be wasting our energy among ourselves, therefore, because the vast majority of us – Parliament, Council and Commission – are in agreement: Europe needs growth, and Europe needs jobs. How, then, can we put this unity of analysis into action? That is where the European budget comes into play – the common budget that is a budget for investment with no compulsion for consolidation, because it has no debts. A European budget with adequate funds, an innovative structure and the necessary flexibility is quite simply our common instrument for leveraging existing growth potential in Europe, opening up new prospects and maintaining our position in the global competition for talent, technologies and market leadership. The common European budget represents our joint European opportunity, our added value. That cannot be that hard to grasp; even the Council can do so. Jutta Haug,  
rapporteur for the opinion of the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Food Safety.

 Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, the Committee on the Environment is responsible for the budget lines for the environment, public health and food safety, and controls 0.76% of the Union’s budget. Overall, we were very pleased with the implementation rates. A full 99.26% of resources are tied up in the environment and climate change sector, while the figure in the LIFE programme, our flagship and our only financial instrument for the environment, was 99.4%. The rate was also above 99% in the health sector too. All the available information leads us to the recommendation that the Commission should be granted discharge. I have been dealing with agencies in various capacities for seven and a half years. These seven and a half years have taught me that it is the decentralised agencies that do the lion’s share of the work in Europe, fulfilling the tasks assigned to them by the legislators, Parliament and Council under the ordinary legislative procedure. For seven and a half years, I have seen how the agencies are under particularly close public scrutiny. More than ever before, the specialist committees are particularly rigorous in exercising political control over the agencies. We want to know what staff in the agencies do, how they do it, and what happens with the resources from the Community budget. The agencies’ budgets are not arbitrarily organised in the budgetary process, nor are the agencies absolved of responsibility in the discharge process. However, during these seven and a half years, I have never experienced so many half-truths, insinuations and misinformation being used to create an atmosphere of distrust and suspicion towards the agencies and the people working in them during the discharge process. This is not worthy of the working practices normally followed in this House. This fatal combination is the reason why the Committee on Budgetary Control has applied to defer the discharge for three agencies, the Medicines Agency, the Environment Agency and the Food Safety Authority. Of course, I support criticism of excessively high carry-overs to the next year and of the extremely high cost of governing body meetings. However, these issues do not justify the deferral of the discharge. Speaking from my seven and a half years of experience working with agencies, I can only recommend that our decision in relation to granting discharge should not be based on an unholy mix of half-truths, misinformation and insinuations. With all the information available to us, we can confidently grant discharge to all agencies without exception. Jutta Haug,  
rapporteur for the opinion of the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Food Safety

 Mr President, Mr Dominik, Mr Lewandowski, ladies and gentlemen, let us not be under any illusions. We are in the same position in the budget process for 2012 that we find ourselves in every year: faced by a Council that does not understand the issues. As always, the Council has cut the appropriations for the Commission, even the not very large amount for the environment and climate change, for public health and for food and feed safety. Together with the four agencies, this amounts to just under EUR 1 billion, in other words, all of 0.67% of the EU budget. Therefore, we are very pleased that the Committee on Budgets has complied with all our requests and has restored the funding from the draft budget in all cases. At this point I would like to give my warm congratulations to the rapporteur. Ms Balzani has done an excellent job. We are also pleased that the package which has been negotiated includes seven pilot projects and three preparatory actions from the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Food Safety. We have never been as successful as this in the past. All that remains now is for us all, together with the Council – and perhaps it will work – to ensure that good results for the citizens of Europe come out of the negotiations. Jutta Haug  (S&amp;D

 Madam President, Mr Barroso, Mr Dowgielewicz, the Commission’s legislative proposal has been described by Mr Barroso as ambitious, but realistic and sensible. Having listened to the dismissive and highly critical reactions from various capital cities in our wonderful European Union, it would be easy to believe this. However, if you read the proposal, which is what Parliament does, unlike many areas of government and the large majority of journalists, you get the very clear impression that the time when the Commission was regarded as the engine of European integration and development is finally over. The Commission has failed to meet Parliament’s expectations with regard to the structure of the budget, levels of spending and the extent of the reform of the own resources system. To give one example of revenues, Parliament has said that we want our budget to be based entirely on own resources as laid down in the Treaty. Therefore, we aim to replace the transfers from the Member States completely. At the same time, we want to bring an end to all rebates. What does the Commission do? It proposes replacing less than half of the Member States’ contributions with real own resources and no longer calculating the rebates, but simply applying a flat rate. Well, my goodness! It would have been better if we had at least reached this point only as the result of long negotiations between Parliament and the Council, as a compromise achieved, as far as I am concerned, with the help of the Commission. We in Parliament had hoped that the Commission, as the champion of a Europe-centric policymaking approach, would be on our side during the negotiations with the Council, but now we are anticipating the inevitable discussions with very mixed feelings. Jutta Haug  (S&amp;D

 Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, a year ago, the plenary agreed and mandated a special committee to draft the position of the European Parliament in relation to the next financial perspective. Now, following exactly eleven months of work, the Policy Changes Committee is presenting the fruits of its labours. This was a task that required discipline and concentration and that could only be achieved by adopting an approach characterised by openness, solidarity and mutual trust. For that, let me express my sincerest gratitude to those Members involved in the creative process. The report we have produced, drawn up under the leadership of Mr Garriga Polledo, is a genuinely good result. It is something of which we can be proud. However, as we all know, good results require not just hard-working Members, but also excellent staff. We certainly had this, not just in the shape of our personal assistants and our group staff, but also, above all, in an excellent secretariat. This super team, led by Monika Strasser, was not just competent and professional, but was also more than usually interested in its work. It was patient and creative, extremely well organised, and, at the same time, spontaneous and flexible. Best of all, it was always cheerful and open. They obviously enjoyed all the hard work. I would like to thank this nine-strong team from the bottom of my heart. Thank you very much indeed. (Applause)
 From the outset, Mr Garriga Polledo and I wanted to deliver a report that could be supported by three quarters of Parliament. We actually received a majority of more than four fifths in the vote in committee. We were very pleased with this. Our call for a seven-year financial perspective which is expressed in a structure that reflects the objectives of the Europe 2020 strategy, while, at the same time, respecting all the policies for the European Union and avoiding increasing the European budget to unrealistic levels, must be seen to be reasonable. It is realistic and achievable. Our report contains 174 paragraphs, all of them arguments for more Europe. We genuinely need more Europe. Please read the report. It offers the best basis for convincing our citizens in local debate and for entering into serious negotiations with the Council, which is unfortunately notable by its absence today. Thank you for your excellent work. Jutta Haug,

 Madam President, President-in-Office of the Council, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Food Safety has expressed a very positive opinion to the Committee on Budgetary Control. We were very pleased with how the funds had been implemented by the Commission services. We have no criticisms to make, either as regards the way in which the funds were spent or as regards the level of expenditure. On the contrary, we have nothing but praise for the prompt and positive use of the funds in the LIFE programme. The Commission has succeeded in spending the additional funding that we granted and in doing so usefully. The agencies in our area – the European Environment Agency (EEA), the European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control (ECDC), the European Chemicals Agency (ECA), the European Food Safety Authority (EFSA) and the European Medicines Agency (EMA) – have also managed their money responsibly. In contrast to the competent committee, the Committee on Budgetary Control criticises the European Medicines Agency in its report and even wishes to refuse discharge for this agency. I think that is going too far, to put it politely. If I were being less polite I might say that the Committee on Budgetary Control is interfering in matters outside its sphere of competence. It should please stop doing so. I can only ask Parliament and plenary to improve matters in this respect. Jutta Haug  (S&amp;D
),  
in writing. 
– Though not very ambitious, the first reading compromise improves the current legislation – I therefore voted in favour. Besides the new methodology for substance restrictions, one key improvement is the open scope: all electric and electronic equipment, including equipment for the generation of electric currents, will in the medium term fall under the RoHS legislation. A major drawback, however, is the long list of exclusions, including photovoltaic panels. Excluding this decisive ‘clean’ technology from environmental legislation will send the wrong signal, EU-wide and globally. This is about setting the right regulatory framework for coherent sustainable investments! Even if the production of photovoltaic panels with hazardous substances like cadmium telluride might be more cost-efficient, less problematic alternatives have existed for a long time and have proved to function excellently. I do not see any need, therefore, to cover our roofs and fields with potentially hazardous waste, shifting the disposal challenge to future generations. On this point, I strongly disagree with the position and decision of the EP’s and Council’s majority. Jutta Haug,

 Mr President, Mr Wathelet, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, as rapporteur for the opinion of the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Food Safety regarding the budget, I will not be telling anyone here present anything new. Nevertheless, I would like to point out once again that the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Food Safety is responsible for less than 1% of the budget as a whole, less than 1% of all environmental protection actions, biodiversity actions and actions in the fight against climate change. It is responsible for the whole area of public health, for food and feed safety, and for veterinary measures, as well as for the extremely important work of five European agencies. 1%! Well, in that case, it is certainly not possible to talk of excessive quantities of money. This small amount of money is therefore desperately needed for carrying out our work. It will therefore be no surprise to anyone that we are unable to accept the Council’s cuts. We need the resources. Jutta Haug  (S&amp;D
). 
 – (DE) 
Mr President, Commissioner, I will say right at the outset that I think it is a good document that we have before us here. It is balanced, as Mr Lewandowski has always promised us – balanced with a large number of suggestions and ideas for how we can, and should, continue to work. However, it is not what we as budget specialists in the Committee on Budgets expected. To be honest, we thought there would be an analysis of the current financial framework, and the real optimists even believed that we might also get a small revision for the remaining period of the current financial perspective. However, what we have before us now is purely a glance into the future. Almost every other section mentions how we should do things better in future with regard to our budget, whether in relation to our priorities, how to achieve the goals of the Europe 2020 strategy, better cooperation with our neighbours, better European infrastructure or our future agricultural policy and cohesion policy. This paper even presents ideas with regard to the future structure of our budget and the length of the next financial period. (The President cut off the speaker) Jutta Haug,  
rapporteur for the opinion of the Committee on Budgets.

 Mr President, Mr Wathelet, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, our two rapporteurs have already provided an evaluation of the Council’s position, and now it is my turn to speak on behalf of the Committee. I would like to say right at the start that I am certain that the Belgian Presidency will do as good a job as it possibly can. However, it can only do its job as well as it is permitted to do by the Council as a whole. Unfortunately, we have to admit that, in this regard, the result is poor. The Council has, as usual – and I cannot remember things ever being any different – gone round busily deleting and cutting parts of the Commission’s draft, in terms of both the commitments and the payments. It has done this all over the place at random – and that is also the usual procedure. It has not looked to see where this could possibly make sense and where not. The result is more than EUR 780 million less in commitments and EUR 3.6 billion less in payments. If we look at who this affects in particular, we see that once again, it is the decentralised agencies. We established these agencies together by means of legislation. Both Parliament and the Council were involved, otherwise there would be no agencies. However, if we do not make available to them the funds they need to enable them to do exactly what we have tasked them with doing, we ought to shut them down. Otherwise, every euro we give them really is money down the drain. The same thing applies to the executive agencies. The Commission has already mentioned this. If we bleed dry the executive agencies that are supposed to implement the multiannual programmes that have been decided by law, these programmes are finished. Do we really want that to happen? Elements in the Council hold pious speeches about how Europe must make greater efforts to be, or to become, competitive. In the budget procedure, however, it is precisely those parts of the budget that are intended to promote growth and competitiveness that are being cut, in other words, category Ia. The structural policy figures are being affected in a similar way. Where there are now real requirements for funds from the regions, funding is being reduced by EUR 1 billion. That can hardly be regarded as logical, and it is certainly not wise. We would really like those with the political responsibility to look closely at the content of our budget – the content! – and, in so doing, to have Europe and its added value for citizens in mind and in sight. Then they will indeed find a suitable partner for discussion in us. Jutta Haug  (S&amp;D

Madam President, it is a little unusual, but I must inform my own group that our voting list for the Trüpel report is not correct in the form that we have laid it down. There has been a misunderstanding. We reject all the amendments, except our own. Jutta Haug,  
rapporteur for the opinion of the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Food Safety.

 Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I would just like to address one point, a point that really is a scandal. I am talking about the European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control, the ECDC in Stockholm. Since May 2005, highly qualified people there have had to work in an absolutely hostile environment. Until now, the Swedish Government has been unable to conclude an accord de siege
 with the ECDC, although they desperately wanted this agency, like all Member States always badly want an agency. To this day, none of the employees have a personal identity number, the so-called Folkbokföring
 number. However, this number is used by public administrations, institutions and private companies to identify their customers. Consequently, children born in Sweden cannot be registered, for example, providers of electricity, gas, telecommunications and television withhold their services, landlords refuse long-term tenancy agreements and there are problems accessing doctors and hospitals. For spouses, it means it is impossible to become self-employed in Sweden. There are also enormous difficulties in getting a job. The list could go on. One thing is clear: certain fundamental rights anchored in European law are simply being denied to the staff at the ECDC in Sweden. As a result, all of this has landed before our Committee on Petitions. In any case, the situation is untenable …. (The President cut off the speaker) Jutta Haug,  
rapporteur.

Mr President, Mr President-in-Office of the Council, Commissioner, when we debated this year’s budget in December of last year, we were already aware and, as general rapporteur for the 2009 budget, I mentioned in the discussion that the impact of the financial market crisis and its repercussions on the real economy would be felt in all the Member States. This is exactly what has happened. In April 2009, Parliament and the Council agreed on the funding for the first part of the economic stimulus proposed by the Commission. In order to make the EUR 2.6 billion available, we needed what was referred to as a minor revision of the financial perspective. How would we have been able to find the funds otherwise, given our tight budgetary constraints? The remaining EUR 2.4 billion, which was missing from the total of EUR 5 billion, was to be found this autumn. This is where we are now. Autumn is here and, because Parliament and the Council have come to a sensible arrangement on the 2010 budget, we have a solution. The 2009 budget is also making a significant contribution to this solution. The 2010 supplementary and amending budget cuts the payment appropriations by more than EUR 3.4 billion. In line with this, the margins of the unused areas under the different headings will be reduced by almost EUR 1.5 billion. All of this applies to the 2009 budget, which consists of EUR 133.8 billion in commitment appropriations and EUR 116.1 billion in payment appropriations, and is therefore not exactly on a lavish scale. If we take a look at the budget lines where the Commission found the necessary money, it becomes abundantly clear that the Commission simply does not take the budgetary authority’s resolutions seriously. I would like to remind Parliament that in 2008, when we adopted the 2009 budget, our priorities were also the competitiveness of the European Union, growth and employment. This is why we allocated more money than proposed by the Commission to budget lines which promoted the social dimension by creating more and better jobs and supporting small and medium-sized enterprises. However, it is precisely these budget lines which are being plundered for transfers or amending budgets. Would it be asking too much to call on the Commission to implement the resolutions of Parliament and the Council and to make an effort to ensure that the money reaches its intended destinations where it will have a positive impact? The draft budget submitted to us by the Commission has not been accurately calculated or carefully estimated. In 2009, we had more than 50 transfers and 10 supplementary and amending budgets. It is not possible to talk about budgetary accuracy and clarity in this context and this situation must improve. Our fellow Members in the specialist committees must pay greater attention to the implementation reports in the course of the financial year and the Commission must finally live up to the good reputation that it still has of being an effective European administrative body. I hope that we will all work towards this. Jutta Haug,  
rapporteur.

 Mr President, I would like to thank all my fellow Members. We have managed to find a common position with regard to the Council. However, I would also like to thank the Council and the Presidency of the Council very warmly at this point. Anyone who knows me will be aware that I am normally very sparing with praise and thanks. Nevertheless, I would like to express my sincere gratitude to the Swedish Presidency and, in particular, Mr Lindblad, for its work and its constant presence during the discussions on budget issues. This made a pleasant contrast to the other Council presidencies that I have experienced during the course of my long career as a Member of Parliament. Thank you very much. This morning, many Members took part in the discussion and I believe that on this occasion, there were many more Members involved than usual. The majority of them referred to the limitations of the budget and its structure. Ladies and gentlemen, we can confidently assume that the 2010 budget will be the last of its kind, the last with this structure, which leads us to believe that we can finance the necessary policies of the European Union and its new challenges and tasks in this way. We expect the new Commission to carry out the mid-term review quickly, as, under the terms of the agreements made in 2006, this should have been submitted by 2009 at the latest, in other words, by the end of this year. To spell it out, we also expect a revision proposal for the current financial perspective. We cannot wait until 2014 for reform. We need sustainable instruments now, so that the European Union can meet the challenges of the immediate future with democratic legitimacy, as the Chair of the Committee on Budgets, Mr Lamassoure, has just called for on behalf of all of us. Jutta Haug,  
draftsman of the opinion of the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Food Safety

 Ladies and gentlemen, it is no secret that the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Food Safety takes the view time and again – this year included – that the funds provided in the European budget absolutely do not suffice to provide effective environmental programmes, to maintain our biodiversity and for a fight against climate change that has a chance of succeeding. The fact that the Council makes even further cuts from these meagre funds is as incomprehensible as ever. That is why ‘back to the preliminary draft budget’ is the standard response. There are two things that we must impress on the Commission. The first of these is that we expect it to immediately include what are known as the ‘assigned revenues’ for those agencies that are partly dependent on fees – such as the European Medicines Agency in London or the European Chemicals Agency in Helsinki – in the preliminary draft budget and not to achieve an artificial margin by omitting them. The second point is that we expect the Commission to bring forward a proposal as soon as possible for how it will fund the anti-smoking campaign Help 
in future after the tobacco fund has run out. You see, it is the same every time. Jutta Steinruck  (S&amp;D

When we vote tomorrow on the own-initiative report on a Social Investment Pact, it will become apparent whether we finally have a cross-party understanding of how we need to tackle the crisis. Our collective response must be not simply cost-cutting measures, but specific measures to achieve the Europe 2020 targets. We can achieve these targets, but it will not happen by itself. If we want more jobs, we must make it possible for our economy to employ more people. Between 2008 and 2011, there was a 4 % fall in output in Europe (from 20 % to 16 %) which resulted in an 11 % fall in employment. On the one hand, that means that we have to invest in places where new jobs are needed. On the other hand, it also means that we have to pay special attention to the nature of these jobs: jobs must be sustainable and must offer decent employment conditions. The crisis must not be an excuse for low wages and social dumping! Europe’s economic policy must be expanded to include a compensatory social policy. We in particular, as the European Parliament, must resolutely uphold the interests of the individual in Europe. Accordingly, I would urge honourable Members to press energetically for European workers to be given back their right to decent employment! Jutta Steinruck  (S&amp;D
),

 The working conditions of women in the service sector are still not how we would like them to be. A quarter of all non-typical employees work in the service sector; in the German retail trade, there are almost a million so-called ‘mini-jobs’. Working women, who represent eight out of 10 of those employed in the service sector, are particularly strongly affected by this. We have already achieved a great deal in respect of equality between men and women, and we are on the right path to achieving even more. However, in the context of services, specifically, it is particularly important that agreement is finally reached on the Posting of Workers Directive. Women are particularly strongly affected by this: 58% of all the women working in posted positions in Germany work in the service sector. The percentage of female workers in, for example, care work is considerably higher than in many other sectors, and the working conditions are often very poor. What we need are minimum wage rates, limits on working hours and safety standards that are reasonable for all female workers in Europe. We can only achieve these objectives if we lay down clear rules for the posting of workers by temporary employment agencies. I am therefore pleased to see that the rapporteur takes up the subject of mobility in her opinion. We advocate a clearly regulated legal framework for Europe’s internal market in the field of services in order to prevent precarious labour relations and discrimination. Jutta Steinruck  (S&amp;D

 As rapporteur for the Programme for Social Change and Innovation, which integrates the three programmes EURES, Progress and the European Progress Microfinance Facility, I would like to draw attention to two specific matters. The Committee on Employment and Social Affairs rejected the Commission proposal to finance the cross-border partnerships through the European Social Fund (ESF) from 2014 onwards. If the financing of these partnerships were only to be possible within the framework of the ESF, each participating Member State would have to include this in its operational programme for the ESF. In view of the many priority areas for subsidies that is unlikely to happen. Cross-border partnerships for mobility-related advice must also be financed via the EURES axis. This call is supported across the groups and across the Member States, and I am hoping for the support of the Council. It is a question of facilitating mobility and of providing the associated advice. With a broad consensus and the support of all of the groups, we have introduced a fourth axis for a Youth Initiative. This is about financing specific projects for combating youth unemployment. The Youth Initiative will only be integrated into the programme if additional financing is secured via the multiannual financial framework. The Commission and the Council are always saying that something has to be done to combat youth unemployment, but there is a lack of projects. If combating youth unemployment really is a priority for the Council then this is the opportunity to prove it. Jutta Steinruck  (S&amp;D

 Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, in view of the economic problems, the crisis and the challenges faced by European companies, their employees, creditors and other shareholders and stakeholders, EU company law needs to focus on a sustainable, forward-looking corporate model characterised by long-term thinking. I am therefore asking you to pursue the aims of a social Europe. As part of that, you need to look at the involvement of workers in corporate decisions. You should also involve the social partners in your initiatives. After all, businesses have a social responsibility towards society and in respect of their contribution to growth and employment. In all your proposals, you must ensure that, as far as possible, existing rules on codetermination cannot be bypassed or eroded. We need the highest possible standards in European companies and we need corporate decisions to involve all those affected. Jutta Steinruck  (S&amp;D
),

 I expect the European Commission to finally learn the lessons of the crisis. There are some good ideas, but there is a lack of commitment. I welcome proposals such as support for start-ups, the overdue consultation paper on the quality framework for internships, or the youth initiative to give young people some career prospects. However, well-intentioned proposals do not reduce youth unemployment. Improving the quality of work and strong codetermination must remain key elements of European policy. I reject the idea of the uniform contract of employment, which is another attempt to erode protection from termination of employment. I also take a highly critical view of a new tripartite pay monitoring committee at European level. The EU Treaty excludes the possibility of intervening in wage setting. It must stay that way. Along with the trade unions, we in the Group of the Progressive Alliance of Socialists and Democrats in the European Parliament would warn against using the crisis to undermine the autonomy of the social partners.

 2007 was the ‘European Year of Equal Opportunities’. Five years later and Europe is still at square one. It is true that we have established the legal principle of the same remuneration for men and women. Nonetheless, wage inequality for men and women still exists. We are making little or no progress. I am pleased, therefore, that, as well as setting targets, the rapporteur has also provided some specific, detailed recommendations in her report. We need collective redress when this principle of equal pay is violated. It must be possible to obtain prosecutions for wage discrimination. We are calling for awareness campaigns dealing with wage inequality for men and women. We need wage equality officers in the various Member States. This will enable progress in the Member States to be monitored more effectively. We need to make specific progress. In this case specific progress means pursuing legal initiatives requiring equal pay for men and women. Jutta Steinruck  (S&amp;D

 Mr Clark, you and some of the previous speakers have mentioned a reduction in red tape as a cure-all to get rid of youth unemployment in Europe. I would be very interested to know, however, what exactly you mean by that, and whether you are also aware of the consequences of certain measures. Jutta Steinruck  (S&amp;D
). 
 – (DE)
 Madam President, Commissioner, many of the previous speakers have already mentioned that we are on the way to losing a generation of young people. I think that we all also agree that it is high time that something was done. Initial proposals were made in January this year or in December, so we have already wasted a couple of years with nothing but declarations of intent and a failure to tackle things in concrete terms; instead, responsibilities have been shifted to and fro at European level. I hope that is now in the past. Single-minded austerity is destroying the jobs of our young people. Growth creates jobs and training places, including for the young people of Europe, and also saves the costs of future social expenditure. What we need now is a rescue package for young people, for young Europeans, that is given just as much priority as was the rescue package for the banks. We found it easy to spend EUR 800 billion on rescuing the banks. It was right, and it was important, but we have to do it just as vehemently for something that will be much more important to us in the future, or at least equally as important. Alternatively, what about the EUR 82 billion that has not been spent from the Structural Funds? As the previous speaker has already said, we need to call off the money. That would give us EUR 15 000 to spend on each unemployed young person in Europe, if that would simplify things. Moreover, as the previous speaker mentioned, we also have to use the Structural Funds for this in the future. Together with my shadow rapporteurs, I have started initiatives for my report on the Programme for Social Change and Innovation, so that we very specifically allocate funding for a youth initiative. I hope, then, that I will also have the support of this Parliament, of the Commission and also of the Council in getting this funding, since everyone says that it is so important, and that this will also be anchored today in the other funds. This money could be very well used for the future of us all. Jutta Steinruck  (S&amp;D
). 
 – (DE)
 Mr President, I, too, would like to thank the rapporteur and, like the previous speaker, I welcome this regulation, on which we will be voting today. Europe’s internal market provides benefits for the workers, too, but sadly, in the past, loopholes in the law have been exploited in relation to cross-border mobility. One example of this – and this has been mentioned by a few of the previous speakers – concerns the airline business. Flight routes were often consciously chosen in such a way that airline staff were often socially insured in the Member State where social security was cheapest for the airline. This distorted competition, and it is an example of wage and social dumping, which takes place time and again at the expense of the workers. That is why we, as European Social Democrats, fought hard to ensure that airline staff are socially insured and have to pay their taxes where they are stationed. In a social Europe, there is no room for businesses that exploit the advantages of Europe’s single market while shirking the social responsibility that is the other side of the same coin. Jutta Steinruck  (S&amp;D

Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, without quotas I would not be a Member of this House, but I am also self-confident enough to say that I do not do my work badly, nor am I a bad politician. I believe that the quotas fulfil their purpose, since, in the past, we had 100% male quotas, and the time has come for us to do away with them. The reality is that there is progress when it comes to equal rights for women in Europe. It may be at a snail’s pace, but fortunately the movement is in the right direction. Especially in times of crisis such as those in which we find ourselves at the moment, it becomes particularly clear that there is still major discrimination against women in the European labour market. Women are the first to be fired, in traditional female professions our salaries are currently going backwards in many cases, and women in executive roles continue to be in short supply, despite better qualifications from secondary and tertiary education. Today we have discussed how women in Europe – and this is not news to us – continue to earn less than their male colleagues. It is not enough to talk about this and to debate it, however. Ultimately, we have to also start to change fundamental structures. Professions that are mainly occupied by women are, as a rule, less well paid. We need new and more objective ways of evaluating work, while greater transparency in respect of salaries would also be an important step towards equal pay. The culture of silence in business keeps women in the dark about the fact that they earn less. If we had more transparency within companies, women could defend themselves better against this, and this needs to be tackled now, just as we need quotas on boards of directors, in executive roles or even in political positions.

 The budget consolidation must be based on the objectives of the Europe 2020 strategy. Since the beginning of the crisis, it has been clear that, in focusing on economic consolidation, the Commission and the Member States have forgotten that only balanced and socially just reforms will bring about sustainable growth. Unilateral austerity measures and cuts in social security funding will not result in a stable economy and good, secure jobs in the long term. Sensible tax policies must be introduced to increase revenue. The focus of our efforts this year must be on creating more jobs and combating youth unemployment and poverty. It is completely incomprehensible to me that the Group of the European People’s Party (Christian Democrats) has prevented Member States with a current account surplus from being required to help put an end to the recession and create jobs. This would have been a step towards a single European economic policy. The conservatives should finally understand that national egoism will only intensify the crisis. Jutta Steinruck  (S&amp;D

 Mr President, my question is for Commissioner Andor. As you know, my group has for quite some time been calling for the Posting of Workers Directive to be revised, and I find it very regrettable that the Commission has thus far not done so. It is not as if there is a shortage of reasons to do so: we have social dumping on a massive scale and the principle of equal treatment applies to too few criteria. Furthermore, there is often abuse of posted workers by means of failure to adhere to the rules. What we need is limits on subcontractor chains and more opportunities for information for workers. I therefore await the Commission’s proposals on the posting of workers package with baited breath. My question is this: how does the Commission proposal for the Enforcement Directive seek to tackle the problems with the Posting of Workers Directive that I have outlined? Most importantly, are there measures in the proposal to prevent the well-known problem of social dumping? Jutta Steinruck  (S&amp;D
). 
 – (DE)
 I have a specific follow-up question. You said that the aim was to improve on the original directive. In my initial question, I asked about limits on subcontractor chains, better opportunities for information for workers and better control mechanisms. I also wanted to know what specific steps are being taken to prevent social dumping in future. Jutta Steinruck  (S&amp;D

 I hope that today’s own-initiative report will be interpreted by the Commission in the way it was written by Parliament, because a directive on the transfer of company seats could have considerable negative effects on the rules on corporate codetermination. That applies not just to Germany, but throughout the European Union. The transfer of a company’s registered office could result in the loss of codetermination at corporate level. Transferring the company’s registered office to another country could allow the rules on corporate codetermination in Germany to be circumvented. At present, employees’ codetermination in a company is based on the Member State in which the company has its registered office. We are not talking about a nominal registered office; rather, the company must be registered where it actually has a genuine presence, such as business premises, employees, etc. In other words, it must have a genuine link with the state in which it is registered. We cannot allow the directive on transfers of company seats to be used to circumvent the rights of employees and creditors through the establishment of post-box offices abroad. If separation between the registered office and the administrative seat of a company is allowed, then social rights could effectively be eroded – and that is something we have to prevent. This can only work if the registered office of a company is in the country where it is actually based. That is the way to safeguard effectively the rights of employees in the European Union. I hope the Commission will safeguard social Europe, and the rights of its citizens, in its draft legislation. Jutta Steinruck  (S&amp;D

 Firstly, I would like to say that I am very pleased. This Presidency brings me pleasure in two ways. First of all, the Danish Government is headed by a woman and, secondly, she is a member of the right party. Given that 2012 is the ‘European Year for Active Ageing and Solidarity between the Generations’, I welcome the initiative by the Danish Presidency to encourage older people to join the labour market. The call for increased gender equality will also have a positive impact on labour markets throughout Europe. This is something that is urgently needed, in particular in the light of the demographic change which is underway in Europe. The younger generation has also not been forgotten. The focus will be on young people who leave the education system too early. The European Parliament has shown what it can do in this respect. During the negotiations on the so-called six-pack, we ensured that collective bargaining autonomy was protected as part of all the measures involved. The European Parliament will take this approach in many areas in future. We finally need to solve the problem of fiscal policy. Also, the regulation of the financial markets must remain high on the agenda. The European Parliament will work together with the Danish Presidency under the leadership of the social democratic Prime Minister Helle Thorning-Schmidt to resolve these issues. Jutta Steinruck,

Madam President, I would like to thank the authors of the questions and the Commissioner for his statement. The German Social Democrats are also in favour of mobility and the free movement of workers on the European labour market. That is an important and key fundamental freedom. Although the facts dispel all fears, the German conservative-liberal Government is also no doubt planning to refuse to allow all workers to fully exercise this fundamental right. I find that very disappointing when I look at other European policy areas. In contrast to other countries, Germany has not made use of the transitional periods in order to make the German labour market fit for Europe. Time and again in Germany, I receive reports from colleagues from Romania and Bulgaria informing me of the methods being used in Germany. I can tell you that these are almost always bordering on illegal or are actually illegal. A further extension and a further denial of this fundamental right will only serve to promote fraud, undeclared employment and ostensible self-employment. It is not the influx of workers from Bulgaria and Romania that creates problems but the lack of fair conditions on the labour market. For us in Germany, these include the lack of a minimum wage and too little control of undeclared employment and combating of ostensible self-employment. Therefore, we must also put the principle of equal pay and equal working conditions for equal work in the same place into practice and introduce it in a uniform way at European level. Then, all workers within Europe will also be able to move around to work with dignity. (Applause) Jutta Steinruck  (S&amp;D

 I would like to thank Ms Delli for this report. The importance of health cannot be emphasised often enough. According to the European Agency for Safety and Health at Work in Bilbao, almost 28% of European workers claim to have significant health problems. This means that one in four workers in Europe is affected. Therefore, we must not only apply the existing occupational health legislation better in the Member States; we must also develop and improve it further, because the workplace is constantly changing, too. Whereas physical ailments were previously the top work-related illnesses, today it is mostly mental disorders that are on the rise in the workplace. This development, in particular, must be investigated thoroughly by means of improved health monitoring. The measures need to be adapted for this purpose. Prevention must also play a greater role. Furthermore, we must not forget that there are also certain groups whose health needs special protection. It has been proven that young, older and migrant workers and workers with precarious jobs are more frequently exposed to occupational hazards. If people are working without previous training or the necessary skills, the risk of disease or accident increases sharply. We must prevent this from happening. Jutta Steinruck  (S&amp;D
).

Madam President, this report is a good one and represents an important step in the right direction. Combating poverty and social exclusion is the responsibility of the Member States, but in the past, the national governments have not been sufficiently ambitious and have taken too few concrete measures. Well-meaning words are not enough. The current austerity policies in Europe, which have resulted in cuts in social budgets, are also creating more poverty in new areas. In the employment policy guidelines and the Europe 2020 strategy, we have set ourselves the goal of reducing the number of people at risk of poverty by 20 million. In my opinion, a key factor in this respect is employment, in the form of good jobs. A total of 8% of European employees are classified as working poor and 22% of the people at risk of poverty in Europe have a job. That is a quarter of the population. For this reason, we must begin by introducing fairer labour and social standards and minimum wages. Jutta Steinruck  (S&amp;D

The Professional Qualifications Directive is a key element in the integration of the labour market and an important step in achieving equal opportunities in European society. Many Member States have not yet implemented the directive and there are still far too many problems with recognition. This is also evident in the document from the Commission on which this own-initiative report is based. I welcome this report whole heartedly because it paves the way for the position the European Parliament is to adopt in relation to the promised revised directive at the beginning of next year. From an employment policy perspective, I would once again emphasise that we need to put an end quickly to the sometimes unfair practices found in the Member States. We cannot have a situation where, in many cases, qualifications are not recognised in order to keep wage costs low. This is clearly a problem of misalignment and is causing difficulties for immigrant job-seekers. This not only constitutes an infringement of the principle of equality, but also significantly restricts mobility within the workforce. The European Parliament needs to take a clear line on this in the forthcoming revision of the directive. I look forward to continued excellent cooperation. Jutta Steinruck  (S&amp;D

 Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, Nokia was exempted from paying tax in Romania for 30 years and only three years later is moving to Asia. Nokia received massive financial support for the construction of its plant in Bochum in Germany and then for its plant in Cluj in Romania. At the same time, the redundancies and the safeguards put in place for the employees were financed from public funds. I believe that it is dishonest to cite the crisis and production costs that are allegedly too high or, as has been mentioned today, environmental legislation as a justification for mass redundancies. Every employee at the plant in Cluj generates turnover of EUR 1 million each year and costs less than EUR 10 000 per year. We can no longer stand by and watch companies unscrupulously pocketing European money and then simply moving on like a plague of locusts. All the small agencies working on European projects have to sign contracts concerning the sustainability of their projects. Why does the same rule not apply to large companies? It is high time for us to introduce clear, tough regulations in this area. A voluntary approach and calls for compliance are completely useless. As long as companies like this exist, the European Globalisation Adjustment Fund, which is vitally important for workers in Europe, must not be called into question. We must help the people who are suffering. Jutta Steinruck  (S&amp;D

Madam President, ‘new skills and new jobs’ takes the form of guidelines for the Europe 2020 strategy and represents an important step towards increasing employment and growth. However, this must not mean that the labour markets are made more flexible unilaterally, without the involvement of unions and management, and, at the same time, that workers have little or no social protection. Flexicurity, a combination of security and flexibility, has so far only been used by the Member States as a magic word which will allow them to gradually increase flexibility and also to make working conditions more precarious. We do not want flexicurity under these circumstances. A cheap approach will not create jobs. We have established this during the discussion on the previous item. Therefore, I would like to emphasise once again that we are strongly opposed to the single open-ended contracts proposed by the Commission. From our perspective, offering contracts which will result in a lowering of social standards to young people who are starting work will not create one single job. Instead, it will play the different generations on the labour market off against one another. Labour market reforms must be negotiated with unions and management and must provide robust pension systems, training, employee rights and social security. We are very much opposed to interventions in the national systems for wage negotiations involving management and unions. I would like to thank everyone involved. I hope that tomorrow, we will adopt this positive report which would be further improved by the two amendments from the Group of the Progressive Alliance of Socialists and Democrats in the European Parliament.

 Public procurement not only needs to be made more flexible; it also needs to be made more sustainable. We must use the revision of the procurement directives as an opportunity for a change of strategy in favour of qualitative growth. We need to use public procurement to get rid of existing inequalities and to provide ecological incentives: it is a matter of good work on public contracts, adhering to collective agreements and maintaining and checking social and ecological standards. These requirements are more important than ever when faced with strict budgetary constraints. I am pleased that the report incorporates some of these demands, particularly the anchoring of social and ecological standards and the removal of the criterion of the cheapest offer. We need to maintain this line in the announced revision of the directives at the end of the year. We need to go even further, however: it is a matter of the protection of posted workers, compliance with working standards and collective pay agreements and good work. I hope that the Commission has noted the signal we have sent and will take it into consideration when making its proposals. Public procurement is not a market-based instrument for achieving the aims of the EU 2020 strategy, but rather needs to be used to develop the social and ecological aspects of the European project further.

Madam President, my question is directed at Mr Andor. A few weeks ago, Mr Andor, I visited a large building site in France along with other Members from my group to find out at first hand about how mobile European workers are being treated. Those employees in particular who were supplied by temporary employment agencies and who came from Poland, for example, were being subjected to appalling exploitation. Their working conditions were very poor. During this year alone, up to the time of our visit, three people had died in occupational accidents on the building site. The workers lived in dreadful conditions. Tax and social security contributions were deducted from their wages, but they had no right to health insurance. It was not clear where the taxes were actually going. This is just one of many examples of how the legal and also the illegal opportunities are being exploited. My questions are: What measures is the Commission planning to take to guarantee that the Posting of Workers Directive is implemented properly in the Member States? What proposals is the Commission making to prevent employees recruited through long chains of subcontractors from being exploited? Jutta Steinruck  (S&amp;D

Older women are discriminated against on two counts on the labour market: because of their gender on the one hand, and because of their age on the other. The consequence for women aged 65 and over is the prospect of a poverty-stricken old age. The increase in atypical, precarious employment, mostly involving women, is a growing problem in Europe. We must ensure that women aged between 55 and 64 remain in the labour market and are not sidelined. We must also to create the conditions that allow them to return to work. In the context of 2012 as the Year for Active Ageing, it is particularly important that the European Commission should redouble its efforts to improve the situation of older women and increase their participation in the labour market. Strengthening equality policy and increasing training opportunities are just two ways in which we can improve the situation of older women in the labour market in the long term. A good work-life balance is the key here. Different phases in life are associated with different demands on women in terms of family and professional commitments and should not be punished with pension reductions. Jutta Steinruck  (S&amp;D

 In its communication on social services of general interest the Commission already admitted last year that not all the Member States have the financial means to meet the growing demand for social services. In some countries there are, in fact, gaping holes in the social safety nets. It is important that we now fill these gaps. Mr De Rossa’s report is an important step in this direction, with the aim that social services may continue to facilitate social equality and social integration in the immediate future. The European Commission’s one-sided political concentration on the rules of the internal market is a big mistake. Budgetary consolidation at all costs is not the solution. The public sector has become the main target of all the austerity measures which are aimed at bringing budget deficits back into line following the rescue packages given to banks threatened with bankruptcy. The loss of public services will only increase the suffering of those who have been particularly hard hit by the current crisis in many Member States. I welcome the European Voluntary Quality Framework, which aims to ensure high quality even in difficult times. This is, moreover, a voluntary quality framework that includes the stakeholders in the process, and its principles support the quality systems of the Member States. I hope that the Commission will continue along the lines set out in Mr De Rossa’s report and its own communication from last year; in other words, that it will ‘fill the gaps’ rather than tearing open new holes.

 The subject of the management of spent fuel and radioactive waste is highly topical. Recent events in Japan have once again highlighted the immediate risks which affect workers and citizens who are exposed to radioactive material. We have many tonnes of radioactive waste in Europe which people have to move about. I am pleased that we can lay the foundations which will help to protect these people’s health throughout the whole of Europe. We have produced a report in Parliament which is based on the Commission’s technical report and which puts the focus on people, including employees of transport companies and plants which work with radioactive waste and employees at the final storage sites. Therefore, the members of the Committee on Employment and Social Affairs have focused on protecting the workers involved by putting in place safety measures, health protection measures and training for employees on the subject of radioactive waste. Economic interests must never be given a higher priority than the health of workers and citizens. Therefore, we need comprehensive documentation of all the waste and its management, while it remains harmful to people and the environment. I am pleased that so many of our requirements have been included in the final report by the Committee on Industry, Research and Energy. Jutta Steinruck  (S&amp;D

 I welcome the report on European cooperation in vocational education and training and would like to emphasise how important it is to promote lifelong learning through initiatives and Europe-wide programmes in order to make it possible for workers to have a better future. These days, workers are at the mercy of frequent and risky employment transitions. There are many types of transition: from training, redundancy, internships or precarious employment into full-time employment. The report contains some important points, including increasing the quota of women in work, recognition of informal learning and promotion of languages with the goal of providing mobility programmes. I am particularly pleased that the focus has been placed on education and training for young people, which is something that I will actively support in the flagship initiatives that follow. The transition from educational institution to working life must be as smooth as possible and, in particular, tailored to individual needs, because it must also be possible for young people with inadequate training to gain the skills necessary to be able to work in skilled jobs and to earn a good living. Social background must not determine a person’s educational opportunities. Young people must be given help and support in securing entry to the world of work. However, the cost of a modern labour market policy must not be borne by our workers. Jutta Steinruck,  
rapporteur for the opinion of the Committee on Employment and Social Affairs.

 Mr President, let us get back on topic. As rapporteur for the opinion of the Committee on Employment and Social Affairs, I would like to thank everyone who worked on this report. In the committee, all the groups pursued the unanimous objective of making education and training possible for every young person in Europe and supporting their entry into a career, while no young person should fall by the wayside. I did not base my opinion for the committee on the Commission report, as I found it too unspecific. It was important to me for very specific tasks, too, to be listed in the report. In some cases, I was unable to support the positions taken in the report. In the view of the Committee on Employment and Social Affairs, one important aspect is the transition from school to career. It is a core interface. This transition must take place without time spent waiting around. We also found it important that young people’s entry into their careers should not be associated with social dumping and that it must not take place under conditions of dumping. We felt that the role of traineeships was important. They are important and they are necessary, but their abuse must be avoided and forbidden. We would like to see an initiative for a European qualifications framework laying down minimum standards for traineeships. I will close with a request of Parliament and the Commission to ensure that the Youth in Action programme does not suffer financial cuts or even abolition in favour of the Youth on the Move programme. The work of youth associations is important for social engagement and helps young people progress, both in terms of substance and personally. That is also a major advantage for later working life.

 This report shone the spotlight on an occupational category that is all too often neglected. What would European culture be without creative artists? While developing the creative industries economically, we must not forget those who work in this sector. As the shadow rapporteur for my group in the Committee on Employment and Social Affairs, the social situation and the conditions in which creative artists in Europe live are particularly important. Unfortunately, many of the 5 million people who make their livelihoods from the creative sector live in precarious conditions. Second and third jobs are not rare, as one job is often not enough to live on. A lack of health and pension insurance is on the agenda. Contracts are mostly uncertain, and many creative workers are scarcely able to plan more than a couple of months in advance. Moreover, a fair level of social security protection, with adequate insurance against unemployment, sickness and for old age, must be standard practice also for those working in the creative sector. I am very pleased to see that the rapporteur followed the position of the Committee on Employment and Social Affairs in this regard and included it in the report. It is now time for the Commission and the Member States to remedy these social deficiencies and to promise the many creative minds of Europe that creative artists in Europe need not live as an underclass.

 Mr President, it is very significant that the Member who asked the question has left the room during the discussion. The arguments and questions put by some of the previous speakers once again demonstrate a highly revealing populist mindset. We are in the midst of a crisis and, as usual, savings are being made in areas which affect the workers. I think that this is a very one-sided approach. I would like to look briefly at the European Training Foundation (ETF). It is important because of its cooperation with the International Labour Organisation (ILO) in the EU’s partner countries. It enables the European social model to be exported to acceding countries and provides help with developing education, vocational training and further education programmes and with creating secure jobs. Two weeks ago, I was in Belgrade and, in meetings with education and training providers, I was once again assured of the importance of the agency. The same thing happened in meetings in Turkey. The ETF plays a very important role in helping the acceding countries to enter the EU labour market. If we take a more far-sighted approach, the Arab spring is also very important. We do not want large numbers of refugees to come to Europe, so we must offer people support in their home countries. We must provide education and help the countries to develop training programmes and facilities. Jutta Steinruck  (S&amp;D

 Mr President, Commissioner, I sometimes have the feeling that you should try out all these solutions on the Commission itself so that you could see what impact you are actually having on Europe. Following your speech, I am left with the impression that the Commission really does sit in an ivory tower. The people of Europe – the workers, the low earners and the pensioners – are really picking up the bill, and you are interpreting legislation and competences however you please. On 19 October last year, I received a response to a question that I had put to the Commission in which it was explicitly confirmed that minimum wages and wages in general are the responsibility of the Member States. The response states this very emphatically. Please read it. It is not acceptable for you to give me that kind of answer when it is a good thing for employers and then simply change direction when you believe something is good for the other side. That will make the people of Europe really very unhappy. My fellow Member has just mentioned this. You are chipping away at codetermination. You are weakening the trade unions. That is not the way out of the crisis and you are fully aware of that. Those who caused the crisis must also be the ones to pay for it. (Applause) Jutta Steinruck  (S&amp;D

As we discuss the report by Mrs Nedelcheva today, the 100th anniversary of International Women’s Day, it is high time for us finally to follow up our words with deeds. The disadvantage suffered by women in Europe can only be combated effectively if we introduce binding rules instead of voluntary commitments. These include mandatory women’s quotas on corporate boards, as well as all other levels, the consistent combating of precarious employment conditions, which affect women far more than men, the improvement of career prospects for women during education by systematically expanding the range of careers open to them, a ban on financial disadvantage to women in taxation and income, statutory equality plans in business and industry in order to promote women, and regular checks and reports on the progress achieved in Europe, if any. Let me conclude by saying this: After 100 years of International Women’s Day, we women will no longer be satisfied with simple lip-service. We want binding statutory regulations and we want final recognition that the work of women makes a decisive contribution to our prosperity. Jutta Steinruck  (S&amp;D

 Madam President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, the Europe 2020 Strategy is very important, not only for the development of European social and economic policy, but also for national social and economic policy. We must take care to ensure that this strategy is not misused at European level to pursue a social clearance policy in the Member States. I am extremely shocked that, in its Annual Growth Survey, the Commission is proposing pay cuts and a reduction in social protection. Some previous speakers have already talked about this. The impact on the people locally will be disastrous. It is unacceptable for the people, the workers, to bear the costs of budgetary consolidation alone. I, too, would like to appeal to the Member States to be guided only by the integrated guidelines when they draw up their national reform programmes, as these enable a much better balance between social protection and economic growth. The Annual Growth Survey once again mentions open-ended contracts, which were previously mentioned in the Agenda for New Skills for New Jobs. Mr Andor, we debated this once before in November 2010: young people cannot be integrated into the labour market by watering down employee rights. Experience in Europe has shown that this watering down simply results in a shift to precarious working conditions and does not create new jobs. We need specific measures in order to help those people who are most at risk and not flagship initiatives that operate alongside each other rather than being integrated with one another. Jutta Steinruck  (S&amp;D

 Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, pensions throughout Europe must provide enough money for people to live on. One important requirement is that people have decent jobs, because low paid jobs result in poverty in old age and inadequate pension provision. When I hear other Members of this House saying that people simply need to take out an additional private pension for their old age, I want to reply that many people can barely survive on what they earn, never mind paying for an additional private pension. This is why the first pillar of the pension system is of particular importance. The pay-as-you-go system based on the solidarity principle must form the foundation of European pensions and it must provide enough for people to live on. We cannot simply say that this is a matter for the Member States. We must send out a clear signal that we need pensions which give people enough money to have a reasonable quality of life. Mr Mann gave a detailed description of the German occupational pension system. I would like to mention it too, without going into the same level of detail. In my assessment of the Green Paper, I have come to the same conclusion, which is why we worked on the amendments together in committee. Therefore, I am calling on the Commission to ensure that, in everything which we do in future, the distinctive features of each country – the things that really work well and are essential for the survival of the pension systems in the Member States – are not disregarded. Jutta Steinruck  (S&amp;D

 Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, the free movement of workers, the freedom of establishment and the freedom to provide services are vital pillars of our internal market. Of course, these must not act as a gateway for social dumping. Service providers must respect the law of the State in which they operate. The country of destination principle must thus also be enforced consistently. For that to happen, all the Member States must also do their homework. My home country of Germany has not done its homework in this regard, as there is quite clearly a lack of framework conditions for fair mobility and social security. There are no binding wage floors in many areas, the monitoring of undeclared work is inadequate and we have fictive self-employment as a common way of circumventing labour law. As Mr Geier already said, we also need advice centres in different languages for posted workers, not just for companies. If the freedom to provide services is also to benefit workers, there is still some homework to be done. Jutta Steinruck  (S&amp;D
).

 Mr President, Mr Andor, Mrs Vassiliou, it is true that combating unemployment and the goal of full employment together represent one of our most urgent tasks. As Mrs Harkin said, the people of Europe do not want concepts; they want concrete solutions. I would like to thank you for your initiative. There are a lot of positive approaches here which two colleagues from my group have referred to. However, I believe that some improvements are needed, because more flexibility and more mobility will not create a single new job. I would like to endorse what Mrs Schroedter said in this respect. We need good, secure jobs in Europe and the Member States and businesses must ensure that these are permanent jobs which allow people to earn a good living. This must become a general rule once again and we must work towards this on a European level and choose the right course. In the agenda, you refer to new forms of employment contract with fewer rights for employees who are just starting their careers. You refer to these as open-ended contractual arrangements. In my view, this will not create any new jobs. Experience shows, and the Social Democratic government in Germany found this out a few years ago, that weakening employees’ rights will not result in any jobs being created. Measures of this kind simply turn secure jobs into precarious jobs. We must not allow this to happen in future. Jutta Steinruck  (S&amp;D

 Since the financial crisis of 2008, the G20 Heads of State or Government have been meeting regularly every six months to discuss economic and financial issues and to bolster cooperation in order to achieve stable and sustainable growth for the world economy for the benefit of all. However, I believe that, in order to find a sustainable and appropriate response to the financial, economic or social problems of the crisis, we need a broader-based approach and a more balanced perspective on these problems. The Finance Ministers of the Member States are not in a position to evaluate the situation on the labour market and to come up with answers to the pressing labour and social policy issues that give due consideration to the needs of workers or the people in general. I therefore call for regular meetings of the Ministers for Employment and Social Affairs in the G20. Moreover, I call on the EU and those Member States that are also members of the G20 to develop this idea further and to cooperate more closely with one another in the field of employment and social policy and to aim for a more balanced approach at summit level. We cannot allow competition to undermine the protection of workers’ rights. We need to enforce these rights, not only for the citizens of the European Union, but also for the citizens of other countries around the world. Jutta Steinruck  (S&amp;D

 Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, what I feel is missing from this debate is the necessary distinction between national transposition in the Member States and the task that exists at European level. We all realise that we need to take the special features of individual nations into account. However, where the debate in Germany is concerned, for example, I must say that I can definitely see how Germany could implement this report. What we are concerned with here is creating minimum standards at EU level to establish social framework conditions for women. We are always keen to make reference to the ILO when it comes to good work, protection at work and protecting health, so I ask myself: why not in this case? As far as the debate on costs is concerned, I would like to remind everyone in this House that in Germany – as well as in some other European countries – the anti-discrimination directive brought about a huge amount of lobbying on the part of enterprises. There was talk of an avalanche of costs, of companies going bankrupt, of burdens on the economy and on workers themselves. Looking back years later, how much of this happened? None of it. I find this debate, this lobbying, very reminiscent of that time. I urge you at last to put the economy on one side and to put people at the heart of what we do. I am not one of those merely sermonising here. I have stated that I advocate a social Europe. For me, that includes women. In this situation, women need our help. Jutta Steinruck  (S&amp;D

 The experience of countries where liberalisation has already taken place shows that liberalisation of postal services is a downward spiral. Competition must not be played out at the expense of workers, in other words on the basis of pay and working conditions. We must retain high quality jobs in the European postal service, because that is the only way that we will be able to guarantee the universal service for everyone. Postal services must be equally accessible to everyone, wherever they live – it must be a basic right. It is the Commission’s job to protect the citizens of the European Union from social dumping and to maintain labour standards. So far, however, nothing has been done. The opening up of European markets must not go hand in hand with the abolition of social protection rights. We reject the competition between the social systems of the Member States. I call for a moratorium until the social impact has been investigated, social conditions are secure throughout the postal market, the financing of the universal services is ensured and a way is found for competition to be based on quality and innovation in the market. Member States must provide legislative guarantees of the full accessibility of postal services. Jutta Steinruck  (S&amp;D

 Mr President, I would like to ask the Council to take note of our vote today and I would like to request a brief statement. Jutta Steinruck,  
on behalf of the S&amp;D Group.
 – (DE) 
Madam President, I would like to begin my speech with a criticism of the procedure. Parliament’s work has been greatly impaired by the late tabling of this report. It was only really able to present its position because exceptions were made and the Council is not now going to debate this matter until the autumn summit. In the end, a workable compromise was found. The cooperation between the rapporteur and the shadow rapporteurs was excellent. That can also be seen by the fact that we received a clear majority for our position in committee. As Social Democrats, we were able to include very many of our key concerns, although we are not happy with every point. However, I am grateful for the assurance from the Belgian Presidency that it will support Parliament’s position. In order to facilitate this procedure, we have tabled four amendments, for which we request support in tomorrow’s vote. It was important to us that the guidelines for employment policies contain social components, in other words, a definition of good work, the stipulation that good work must also be well paid, and that testable interim goals are also laid down. However, the guidelines will only be taken seriously in the Member States if the Commission and the Council take them seriously. We therefore ask the Commission to ensure that appropriate measures are implemented and that the results are also examined. I am pleased that the Commissioner has assured us that our positions will be included, because Parliament has added a very socially-orientated and worker-friendly component which will benefit the people of Europe. That is also what people expect of this Parliament and this represents an improvement in social conditions. Jutta Steinruck  (S&amp;D
). 
 – (DE)
 Mr President, Mr Barroso, Mr Van Rompuy, it is important that we all work together to promote growth and employment and attempt to eliminate the causes of the crisis. However, our goal must be to learn from our previous mistakes and not to make those mistakes again. One subject which we must not lose sight of and which is particularly important to me is the fight against poverty. It is a pity that the European Heads of Government were not prepared to commit to implementing the Commission proposals on combating poverty as quickly as possible. The message sent out by the Council last week is that Europe does not care about the poorest people. The original goals have been watered down. All that remains are three key figures and the objective of lifting 20 million people out of poverty. That is not enough and it is clear that there is a real lack of political will in this respect. We had really hoped that the Commission proposal to reduce poverty by 25% would be adopted and taken forward, because poverty ultimately represents a risk for Europe. Jutta Steinruck  (S&amp;D
). 
 – (DE) 
Madam President, of course we need economic governance and, of course, the Member States must consolidate and restructure their budgets. However, what we are now seeing is a radical reduction in the social budget. Unemployment and poverty are increasing and people do not understand why banks and companies are receiving support while the politicians simply pay lip service to combating poverty and unemployment and put in place objectives that cannot be monitored. This is why the Europe 2020 strategy and the integrated guidelines are so important. We want to continue striving for the goal of full employment and we want proper work, not vulnerable jobs. When it comes to combating poverty, our goals really must be more ambitious. This is why we are calling on the Council to take up the Commission’s proposal to reduce poverty in Europe by 25%. The European Parliament has specific objectives and it is important for Parliament to be taken seriously. Jutta Steinruck  (S&amp;D
). 
 – (DE) 
Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, I would like to appeal once more to the conservatives and liberals that we cannot here place the interests of the self-employed above the safety of the people of Europe. Entrepreneurial freedom is undoubtedly a very good thing, but the safety of our children and of everyone on the roads is more important – and that, to my mind, is the responsible way for Europe to act. Tomorrow’s vote is an opportunity to show that you are not in favour of social dumping. What this debate has also shown in recent months is that a debate on ostensible self-employment in Europe is long overdue. More and more regular employment relationships are being ousted by ostensible self-employment, which is why we urgently need the situation to be analysed and a proposal to be made for what we can do about it. As the Commissioner stated quite clearly today, we have had many declarations of intent on this matter. It is time to act at last. Jutta Steinruck  (S&amp;D
).  
– (DE)
 Mr President, Mr Mann, I hope you are in regular contact with your Chancellor, if you see things in the same way that I do. The EU 2020 strategy is a real opportunity to make Europe more social and we need that opportunity at this very moment when many hostile words are directed at Europe and when it has distanced itself from the people. We absolutely need to offer something positive to our citizens that will offset that situation. When it comes to growth and employment, we should stop putting people’s interests behind those of business. Indeed, that must be the key objective of the EU 2020 strategy because Europe needs social progress. I already pointed that out last Monday at the committee debate on employment policy guidelines: we must not lose sight of the goal of full employment, but we cannot have full employment at all costs because we need good jobs. We always say we need jobs, but what matters to me is that these jobs are good, that there is social security, that people do not have to receive subsidies and that they can actually make a living from these jobs. The ever more precarious nature of working life, the increasing income inequality and also growing poverty – which many speakers have talked about today – must finally be brought to an end with the EU 2020 strategy. We need a more active labour market policy and one which covers many areas. Finally, people expect more specific answers, very specific answers, in fact, and not an umpteenth strategy!

 Yesterday, the media told us that the Opel plant in Antwerp will close. This is just one of many examples of jobs being lost in Europe. Next Thursday, the European industrial trade unions will be holding a day of demonstrations throughout Europe. They are calling for jobs and the future of Europe as an industrial base to be safeguarded. The trade union members want full employment, but they also want effective European policies and definitive answers today, not in five years’ time. Your work programme does not provide very definitive information in this respect. You have just referred to the guidelines and the Europe 2020 position paper. In my view, this is not specific enough. You should provide examples. What do you plan to do to re-establish our strategically important industrial sectors in Europe and what role is the Commission playing in making the automotive industry future-proof and in safeguarding jobs? Jutta Steinruck  (S&amp;D

 Commissioner Špidla, Madam President, the Commission should protect European interests and on that point I agree with what previous speakers have said. The Commission should reconsider its approach. From tomorrow, General Motors will be trying to rake in EUR 2.7 billion worth of public aid across Europe, without contributing a single cent of their own. We have to make it clear that Europe, i.e. the Commission, will not make any money available if that means that further plants will be shut down or that production will relocate outside Europe. However, at the same time, Member States should not support General Motor’s plans to that effect and should not think only about saving their own plants. We should not allow workers to be played off against one another, nor should Member States allow themselves to be so, because any such divisions would result in further off-shoring. The European taxpayer and Opel’s other workers in Europe should not foot that bill. Nobody will understand that over there! People want to understand what the European Union is doing. Whatever plans General Motors might have for Europe, the Commission should ensure that they play to European rules. The European Works Council has proposed a solidarity-based solution and a sound financial rescue plan for Opel, whereby all the plants would remain in Europe and whereby adjustments would be made in all plants on the basis of solidarity. Management should not be allowed to ignore this plan, nor should Mr Reilly and his colleagues disregard the consultation process with the European Works Council or the rights of consultation and participation which we have secured for European workers. A solidarity-based European solution for Opel is possible, but the Commission must get involved. Jutta Steinruck  (S&amp;D

 Madam President, I have a comment to make on what our fellow Member has said about there not being enough German MEPs attending this debate. Although I am a German Social Democrat, I share your criticism of the Minister of North Rhine-Westphalia, who is a member of the CDU, having said that he was pleased that it was the plant in Antwerp, rather than the one in Bochum, that was being closed down. We, the German Social Democrats, are in favour of a European solution, in other words, the plan put forward by the European Works Council. Let me say this very clearly once again: I have no idea why the German Conservatives and Liberals have shirked this debate. Jutta Steinruck  (S&amp;D
). 
 – (DE)
 Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, this is actually about finding a common European solution, rather than about national egotism. Opel Europe has a significant role to play in industrial policy in Europe and this is not only about jobs at Opel, but also about jobs in many automotive supply companies in a number of European countries. The decision in favour of Magna – and the European Works Council has confirmed this for me – achieved a consensus in the European Works Council, too, and its members are working flat out on European solutions. The workers are ready to make sacrifices for this cause, and we expect the same from all the decision makers. Everyone needs to work together, and to do so quickly. Previous speakers have already talked about this. In the interests of the workers, it also makes sense, of course, for thousands of jobs truly to be temporarily stabilised with State aid. We will not grant validity to any competition arguments that have been put forward. We are dealing with people and with jobs, but also with whole regions. The path that we were put on under Germany’s auspices must now lead to the best possible result for all European workers, across all European sites. Kerstin Westphal,

Madam President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen. I can only say that patience is its own reward. The report on type approval for Category L vehicles has turned out well in the end. The work took longer, overall, than we all thought it would – certainly longer than we hoped it would – and there were a lot more pitfalls along the way than we would have liked. However, I would like, at this point, to thank the rapporteur, Mr van de Camp, most warmly for his excellent cooperation. Together we achieved a lot in our talks with the Member States. As rapporteur for my group, I commend this report to the House – even though it could have been better. By better I mean safer. For us Social Democrats, the emphasis right from the start was on the safety of vehicles and thus the safety of their drivers, above all those driving scooters and motorcycles. The figures for motorcycle accidents have remained constant for years. Basically the number of fatal accidents is declining in Europe – apart from those involving motorcycles. Cutting the number of motorcycle and scooter fatalities is something I feel passionate about. Fewer deaths on Europe’s roads was and is my goal. Each death is one death too many. In a regulation that brings so much benefit to the internal market, this issue must be addressed with vigour. I remain convinced that this can be achieved through effective anti-lock braking systems (ABS). I am equally convinced that they are cost-effective. It just is not true that ABS is too expensive. Anyway, we have secured a mandatory requirement that manufacturers must, as of 2016, fit all new motorcycles of 125 cc and over, and from 2017 all existing motorcycles of that capacity, with ABS.  Motor scooters may be fitted, at the choice of the vehicle manufacturer, with ABS or a combined brake system. In this respect, it must be said, unfortunately, that we have not managed to improve on the Commission’s proposal. I would have liked to have achieved a lot more here, but the Commission and Member States were – I choose my words carefully – very slow to move forward on the whole business. However, we secured the promise of a Commission report in 2019. The report is to include road accident figures from the Member States and will consider the mandatory fitting of ABS to motor scooters. It will be forwarded to Parliament and the Council. On the basis of the report, the Commission will then decide whether or not to make the fitting of ABS to motor scooters mandatory. As you can see, this remains very much a work in progress. Thus we shall seek to close the loophole in the law in 2019. I am sure the figures we receive will vindicate me. I am convinced that this is indeed a good day for two-wheeler riders in Europe, and that we shall see a drop in the accident figures in future. Kerstin Westphal,  
rapporteur.

 Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, demographic change is one of the most important themes in our times. For example, we know that every second girl born in Germany today will live to see their 100th birthday. My 13-year-old daughter was happy when she heard this news. However politicians must naturally also respond to this fact, drawing conclusions and establishing general political conditions. My report, which will be the subject of a vote tomorrow, deals with some of these conclusions and the associated general conditions. It does not deal with social issues such as pensions. This is quite simply beyond the remit of the Committee on Regional Development. What it does consider, however, is the question of what European cohesion policy can do and how we can organise future cohesion policy in order to respond to the pressing issues. I would like to draw attention to four areas mentioned in the report. Firstly: we need to tailor European cohesion policy more closely than ever to demographic change. Demographic change continues to play quite an important role in the Europe 2020 strategy and in the legislative proposals. Now, as we come to implement the strategy, we must ensure that the topic remains on the agenda. The second area relates to infrastructure: we need infrastructure suitable to the needs of older people in order to avoid social exclusion. This includes accessibility to public buildings, for example. This move would also benefit other groups, such as families with small children or people with disabilities. At the same time, we need to make areas affected by emigration more attractive, particularly to young families. The third area relates to older people, children and families. More and more older people live in the various regions of Europe. Regional policy must respond to this fact. For me, this also means promoting so-called multi-generational housing, as well as European Regional Development Fund (ERDF) and European Social Fund (ESF) support in the social and health care sectors. Also, when it comes to the prevention of emigration, I believe that well-qualified full-time day care for children plays a very important role. It is a pity that the majority in the committee were not in favour of providing free child care. I would have liked to see much more courage here. The fourth area of concern is employment. Our prime concern here must be to combat unemployment among women and young people. We have a cohort of young women who are the best-educated generation in Europe of all time. If these women are denied employment opportunities, then we could be accused of being responsible ourselves for creating the shortage of specialist professionals. It is also important that we should make much more use of the knowledge and experience of older people. Appropriate structures must also be established for this purpose in the regions. I believe we all agree that we need to take an active approach by shaping demographic change rather than just managing it. European regional policy can make a huge contribution here. I would like to thank all the members of the committee who have worked on this report. This has been a long journey and several people have grown old and even retired while the work went on. The result has been worth the effort, however. I think we have produced a good report and I hope that the majority will vote in favour at tomorrow’s plenary. Kerstin Westphal  (S&amp;D

 Mr President, Mr Hahn, Mr Andor, ladies and gentlemen, I do not need to emphasise how important cohesion and regional policy is for the process of living together and growing together in Europe. However, I also believe that in future, regional policy and cohesion policy must focus more closely on our cities. Cities are an important driving force behind development in Europe. At the same time, they are currently suffering from environmental, economic and social problems. This is why I have a particular question for Mr Hahn. What opportunities do you think there are for highlighting the urban dimension? To come to the point, Mr Hahn, you recently indicated during an event which took place in this House that you had a specific percentage of the regional funding in mind which would be reserved for highlighting the urban dimension. Is this still the case? If so, what percentage were you thinking of? Kerstin Westphal  (S&amp;D
),  
in writing. 
– On behalf of the S&amp;D Group, I want to express our general consent to this report. It is important that the European Parliament fights for greater transparency in regional policy, but we reject the so-called ‘naming and shaming’, as asked for in point 16 of this report. We certainly agree to a tougher line on communication and information requirements, but the goal of more transparency – which we also support – should not be achieved by the wrong means. We are afraid of having a ‘witch-hunt’ when naming and shaming is carried out. The European Commission should not be made a moral authority which achieves group discipline by naming, shaming or blaming. We also reject this approach as it could lead to a more complex situation and non-implementation in the Member States. Despite this concern, we agree – as stated above – with the general ideas of the report and think it is very helpful. Kerstin Westphal  (S&amp;D
).

 Mr President, I would like to come back to the report by Mr Cortés Lastra, which I think is a very good report. Indeed, the Cohesion policy is actually the best instrument for mobilising investment in growth and employment. However, I would like to highlight again the importance of towns and cities here, because they will play a key role in achieving the objectives of the EU 2020 strategy. Four out of five Europeans live in urban areas. Towns and cities are the driving force of economic growth in Europe. At the same time, they are experiencing many problems particularly acutely. Key words here are social integration, the environment and transport, for example, but also demographic change. Therefore, towns and cities have a particular role when it comes to actually improving the living conditions of citizens. In addition, Europe’s towns and cities are key players in the fields of innovation, research and education, and therefore play a fundamental role in the implementation of the Lisbon Strategy and the EU 2020 strategy. All of this should be taken into account during the implementation of these strategies and during the shaping of the future course of the Cohesion policy. Knut Fleckenstein  (S&amp;D

Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, in this year’s enlargement strategy, the Commission has defined the key issues very accurately. Our rapporteur has reiterated them very effectively. It is about the credibility of our policies, honesty towards the EU’s citizens and the citizens of the candidate countries, and clarity on the criteria, which must be fulfilled prior to accession. We cannot pursue policies which bypass public opinion in the EU Member States. Public opinion in many countries is sceptical towards further rounds of enlargement. It is therefore the task of policy-makers – not only the task of the Commission but our task too – to bring clarity to the accession process and to explain it more effectively at home. Any country which successfully completes the accession negotiations will have progressed through a lengthy reform process and will have incorporated many of our legal provisions into its system of governance. An improved enlargement process does not mean offering a firm timetable but creating more clarity for the steps along the road towards accession. That is why we must send out a clear signal. Firstly, we want to keep the EU’s door open to the European countries because an enlarged EU offers all of us security, democracy and prosperity. Secondly, any country embarking on the road towards accession should be able to count on support from all of us. Thirdly, however, the pace of progress towards accession will ultimately depend on how quickly the accession criteria can be fulfilled and implemented. We know from experience that ‘rebates’ are not helpful here. Let me give some advice to my German colleagues in the House and at home: we Germans should not always act as if we were expecting to have to pick up the tab at the end of the process! We have profited to such an extent from previous enlargements that I feel sure that we can look forward to the next stage in a calm and confident manner! Knut Fleckenstein  (S&amp;D

Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, WTO membership can definitely support the urgently needed modernisation of the Russian economy, through easing technology transfer and improving investment security – these are just two examples. It is just two years since Russia agreed on a partnership for modernisation with the EU for the same reasons; the declared aims of this partnership include the alignment of technical standards, the extension of investment opportunities in key sectors for innovation and growth and the general strengthening of trade relations – all these are improved by WTO accession. However, successful accession to the WTO may perhaps merely give Russia more of a voice in other international bodies. Russia will only benefit from membership of it actually implements the joint agreement on trade facilitation. A partnership with the EU for modernisation only makes sense if Russia complies with its WTO obligations. Cherry picking, WTO à la carte – there are so many pleasing expressions for what we can to some extent still see Russia doing, what Russia is doing with its membership at the moment. The EU advocated for a long time that Russia should at last be a member of the World Trade Organisation and we will prove a reliable partner to our Russian friends in the future, but this relationship cannot function in one direction only. Even the joint project, which has already taken so long, i.e. the joint partnership agreement, can now be facilitated through the WTO accession on either side, since the rules no longer have to be negotiated – they are established. However – there are two conditions: the Russians must really comply, and the EU cannot pile on more conditions. Knut Fleckenstein  (S&amp;D

 Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I would like to highlight two points. You probably cannot tell this from looking at me, but I am not a fan of punk music. We are now all familiar with one punk group and that is Pussy Riot. I see the situation slightly differently from Baroness Ashton, but the subject of whether this was a civil protest or simply hooliganism which caused deep offence to other people is open to discussion. We can perhaps even discuss what the penalty for this sort of behaviour should be. We all agree that a two-year sentence is far too long. However, what should concern us and, most importantly, what should concern the Russians in their own country is the clear indication that this trial is once again an example of the political system exerting influence on the judicial system. That is totally unacceptable. My second point concerns the NGO act, which, as has already been said, has deliberately vague wording so that it can be interpreted as required. We need to set clear boundaries. The best thing to do would be to put this act where it belongs, in other words, in the rubbish bin. However, ladies and gentlemen, there is one thing you cannot say to me, which is that we must now evaluate everything we do together with Russia. I am firmly convinced, and we discussed this 10 days ago with our Russian colleagues in St Petersburg, that the only sensible way forward is to continue to talk to them and to Russian civil society, in order to get things moving. I am not one of those who believe that a discussion of resolutions by less than 3% of the Members of the European Parliament has better prospects for success. Knut Fleckenstein  (S&amp;D
),  
Blue-card question.
 – (DE)
 Mr Posselt, do you also believe that the clear language spoken by this Parliament has not been as successful as we might have hoped and, therefore, that we need both approaches? We need to work together and to develop projects together, but we must also make our opinions clear in the hope that there will be progress. My second question is this. Would you be of the same opinion, as a devout Catholic, if all of this had happened in the Vatican or in your church in Munich? For you, that would probably have been the equivalent of the collapse of Western civilisation. Knut Fleckenstein  (S&amp;D

 Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, the talks between Belgrade and Priština here in Brussels were an initial success. I would like to say that this took a lot of courage on the part of Prime Minister Thaçi and President Tadić. We should recognise their courage because this is the first step in the right direction and a requirement for further positive developments. Now it is our job to show the people of Kosovo that we are serious. This is why we are supporting Ms Malmström in her commitment to visa liberalisation and why we are supporting you, Mr Füle, concerning the feasibility study for a Stabilisation and Association Agreement. You can rely on our solidarity, if you take action in this area. However, there is one thing that we should make clear, which applied in the past and will still apply in the future. Both sides must be aware that they can only make progress towards joining the EU together and in parallel. Neither side will be able to achieve this at the expense of the other. We will not tolerate that. Knut Fleckenstein  (S&amp;D
). 
 – (DE)
 Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I am convinced that the progress to greater democracy in Russia is no longer stoppable. I am also convinced, however, that our Parliament, our groups, the parties behind these groups and the foundations could, and must, do more to help Russia as good friends and advisors. Since the Duma elections, there have been numerous demonstrations and the involvement of civil society has increased dramatically. It is not only politicians who have taken to the streets; there are also many citizens, consisting increasingly of middle class, well-educated people and people who have educated themselves further through travel. We need to step up our dialogue and increase our contact with these people and ensure that there is more people-to-people contact, including by dealing swiftly with the outstanding issues relating to visa-free travel. However, we should step up our parliamentary dialogue now, too. I know that some people think less dialogue is the right response to the elections. I think that is wrong. We need more talks with our colleagues from the State Duma in order to discuss and to persuade and to offer them our experience. In so doing, we should present our views clearly so that our colleagues there can also learn from our experience and avoid the mistakes that we have made, and continue to make. We will best achieve this through clear dialogue and by showing as little as possible of the superior attitude that we sometimes see in this House. The Partnership for Modernisation is a good instrument for this purpose. We surely all agree that economic and technological modernisation is not sufficient and that without modernisation of the law, politics and society, Russia, and therefore our joint partnership, cannot succeed.

 Mr President, Baroness Ashton, ladies and gentlemen, the presidential elections in Russia on 4 March will show whether the government in Moscow has learnt its lesson. They will make it clear whether the processes have been improved and whether we can hold out hope that there will be positive developments in this area. However, the many demonstrations that have taken place since the beginning of December make me very hopeful. They are an indication that civil society is gaining strength and, therefore, for me they are also a sign of hope. At the same time, the large-scale demonstration due to take place on Saturday also highlights the problem faced by the Russian opposition and the protest movement. The so-called systemic opposition parties, which are represented in the Duma, are to a large extent not regarded by the population as being a viable democratic alternative. The inclusion of the nationalists in the protest movement is, thank goodness, giving rise to heated debate. I believe that we need to show solidarity in particular with those who have joined the White Ring protest over recent days and weeks. These citizens come from a wide range of different areas of society and are taking action to protect their civil rights, without having an ideological axe to grind and, most importantly, without any kind of self-interest. They do not want to form a government. Instead, they want the right to freely elect a government. This makes the movement even more convincing. What Russia most urgently needs are state institutions and elected officials who have democratic legitimacy and the trust of their voters and who make a clear commitment to serving the interests of the voters and to combating corruption and other abuses of power. Therefore, we must give this movement our support now and make it increasingly clear in our discussions with our Russian partners that we are happy to cooperate with them, but that we also want to see joint progress being made towards more democracy. Those of us who are members of the EU-Russia delegation will definitely be discussing this when we visit Moscow in eight weeks and it would be good if the Commission could play an active role in supporting the delegation. Knut Fleckenstein,  
rapporteur.

 Madam President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, I would like to start by offering my sincere thanks to the shadow rapporteurs for their very open, excellent collaboration. It was not too difficult in this case, as we are all convinced of the good and very efficient work that the European Maritime Safety Agency (EMSA) has done in the last few years. There quickly emerged a relatively homogeneous picture of what we envisage the future work of this agency to be. We also all agreed that any kind of extension of competences must either have European added value or generate clear synergy effects in the Member States. Allow me to mention just a few aspects. On 20 April 2010, we experienced the worst oil disaster in human history in the Gulf of Mexico. On 10 August 2011, there was the oil spill at the Gannet Alpha platform in the North Sea. The report on oil pollution by the Oslo-Paris Commission reveals that, in 2008, there were more than 500 oil spills at oil and gas platforms in the North Sea. It was therefore right for the Directorate-General for Energy to table a legislative package in this regard to improve the regulation of oil platforms. This includes an independent third party who is to monitor the safety of the oil platforms. Together, we should open the door for EMSA here. What European body could perform this supervisory role better? I know that EMSA does not currently have the relevant expertise. However, that is a weak argument. There are large overlaps with the areas in which EMSA currently works, and it is considerably more efficient these days to extend the available resources rather than to create entirely new ones. If the Member States now say that they are prepared to extend EMSA’s mandate and state that EMSA is now not only responsible for shipping accidents, but is also to perform the clear up following oil spills caused by drilling rigs, this will perhaps reveal a modicum of common sense, but it will certainly not be a major breakthrough. The European Parliament must focus on preventive measures. Merely cleaning up after the event is not enough. Commissioner Oettinger said that numerous facts about accidents confirm that prevention is better than trying to put things right afterwards. This statement is perhaps not particularly helpful, but it is right nevertheless. I would like to address two more points that also seem to me to be important. We need European maritime transport without borders. We have already had many debates on this subject, but there is still too little being done and too slowly for us to achieve this objective. With the help of EMSA and its recording capabilities, we can also make progress in this area. My next point is that we all know how important it is to support maritime occupations in the European Union. We cannot and do not under any circumstances want to win the competition for the lowest personnel costs and the reduction of social standards. However, when it comes to the quality of the training and further training of the seafarers, then we can play a leading role, and EMSA can and must contribute its knowledge and expertise in this regard. In committee, the report received the support of a large majority. It is intended to make it clear that Parliament takes its proposals seriously. I am confident as regards the negotiations with the Council. However, this presupposes a serious readiness to negotiate. That is what I am asking for. Knut Fleckenstein,  
rapporteur.
 – (DE)
 Madam President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, I would just like to thank those involved once again for their cooperation and also those who have just spoken for their contributions to the debate. There are naturally a few things that have not received adequate mention in our debate, as there has not been enough time – apprehending environmental polluters for example, and you mentioned piracy. I would just like to make one thing clear once again, Mr van Dalen. This report does not call for a European coastguard. We are, however, asking to finally receive the expert opinion that we want – as decided by this Parliament a long time ago – on how this coastguard should be structured and what advantages and disadvantages it would have. Mr Gallagher mentioned that EMSA saves the Member States a lot of money. That is correct. Now the issue of a coastguard could be seen as an example of the fact that we will only really have these synergy effects if we do not merely set something up jointly but if, back in our Member States, we also remember what was decided in Brussels and reduce the national structures accordingly. Only then will we see the synergy effects. Where one or two transport ministers are concerned, I have the impression that they join in the decision-making process in Brussels but then forget to tell anyone back home that adjustments need to be made as a result. I am a German MEP so I know what I am talking about. Of course, we could not regulate everything. The gender issue is something we are taking seriously. Nevertheless, it is obviously difficult to regulate the gender issue in a satisfactory way in bodies to which 27 Member States each send one person. As regards competences – whether national or regional – we sometimes had the feeling in committee that this was a Spanish domestic discussion. It is all the same to me whether it is national or regional. The authorities must be the competent authorities, and that is what will make them the right points of contact. How the competence is determined is up to others at a local level. My final point is that EMSA contains an ‘S’ for ‘safety’, you are absolutely right about that. However, Ms Foster, if you believe that as far as oil platforms are concerned, there are particularly good regulations in place, then I would remind you once again of what I said earlier: 500 accidents on oil and gas drilling rigs in 2008 show that we really need to consider how we can improve this situation and perhaps also integrate this within an agency that already deals with similar problems. Knut Fleckenstein  (S&amp;D
). 
 – (DE)
 Madam President, Baroness Ashton, I can only endorse what Ms Oomen-Ruijten has said about the elections. We very much want to make it clear to the Russian President that his announcements must be followed by actions and that we will take him exactly at his word. I think that what Mr Swoboda has said is right. We should hold a major hearing for everyone involved, once the OSCE Office for Democratic Institutions and Human Rights (ODIHR) has submitted its report. Therefore, I think it is wrong to call for new elections now, before the report is available. I would just like to say one thing to Mr Kelam, but unfortunately he is no longer here. Perhaps it is simply an error in the interpreting. He said that the demonstrators in Moscow represent an opportunity for us. I do not believe that this is right. It is not an opportunity for us, but an opportunity for the people of Russia. We need to be careful about what we say. Elections will be an important topic of conversation at the summit, but this can also be a summit which gives confidence. There are two positive points which I would like to mention briefly. One is accession to the World Trade Organisation (WTO) after 18 years of negotiations. This not only clarifies the rules, but could also make a new agreement with us easier, hopefully in future prevent the unilateral trade restrictions that there have been in the past, and alleviate the repeated pressure caused by the Siberian overflight rights. The second and final point that I want to touch on briefly is the question of visas and free movement. We are pleased that a regulation will be put in place on the border traffic to and from Kaliningrad. That will really make the situation easier for people in Poland and in Kaliningrad in particular. The joint steps which the two countries aim to agree on and which have been carefully prepared will hopefully, with good will on both sides, lead to a regulation on visa-free travel at some point. We will be discussing modernisation, human rights and the development of a civil society and we want to achieve sensible, positive results. However, without personal contacts, none of this will succeed. Knut Fleckenstein,  
on behalf of the S&amp;D Group.

 Mr President, Baroness Ashton, ladies and gentlemen, I shall be brief, because the subject of Russia comes round every four weeks and I stand by the opinion that I expressed four weeks ago. Yes, we regret the fact that yet again, parties in Russia, most recently the liberal party, are not approved and therefore cannot stand for public election. I am convinced that no nation in the world will put up with this in the long term. I am also convinced that our Partnership for Modernisation could be implemented much more effectively if the Russian Government could allay concerns about democratic shortcomings and the rule of law with bold decisions. Until such time as that happens, we shall not let this subject rest, also because we believe that it is in the interest of our partner, in other words, Russia itself. For my part, I should also like to add that I am equally convinced that we can achieve a great deal more by stepping up our talks and our cooperation than by adopting monthly resolutions, however appropriate these may be. Human rights and democracy are indivisible. Our public contribution to this is important, our criticism of Russia is justified, but we would be even more credible if we were to identify the shortcomings within the EU with the same honesty and acuity and perhaps even more unanimously than before. As long as Members of this House maintain – as they did yesterday – that modern Hungary is a model democracy, then, what my fellow Member from the European People’s Party (Christian Democrats) said continues to apply: that the self-righteousness of some Members of this House is hair-raising. I agree with that. I am not saying this to please anyone in Moscow, but because I am firmly convinced that we can make a much more effective contribution than we are making at present. (The speaker agreed to take a blue-card question under Rule 149(8)) Knut Fleckenstein  (S&amp;D

 – (DE)
 Mr Migalski, you are absolutely right. The two things cannot be compared. However, I believe that you enhance your credibility by dealing with the problems in your own backyard – quite irrespective of any criticism, including of Moscow. My second point is that, while we are perfectly entitled to criticise Moscow, the question must be how we can most effectively help bring about some kind of change. I am convinced that that will not be achieved through repeated resolutions. Knut Fleckenstein  (S&amp;D
). 
 – (DE)
 Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I would just like to mention two points because Mr Swoboda has already mentioned a number of points on behalf of our group. Russia is indeed at an important crossroads. Its internal political situation will be determined by the elections to the Duma in December and the question of who will continue the modernisation embarked upon as president from 2012. One can also put a positive slant on this. There could be no better opportunity to strengthen international confidence in Russia’s development. This is conditional upon there being fair elections, fair opportunities for registration and access to the media for the candidates, to ensure at least an element of equal opportunity. My second point concerns the Partnership for Modernisation between the EU and Russia. This opens up new opportunities for effective cooperation. We should therefore not miss the opportunity to support Russia vigorously in this modernisation – not just by investing in the modernisation of the economy, but also in its society. Governments put things down on paper and, as we all know, you can say what you like on paper. Citizens, however, become very restless if what is stated on paper is not implemented. Civil participation and the involvement of civil society, entrepreneurs, researchers, young people and artists are essential to a self-determined society of solidarity. We can only successfully support such modernisation, however, if people can come together easily in order to learn from each other and exchange experiences. For these reasons, the EU and Russia should finally reach agreement on the common steps that need to be taken to achieve visa-free travel and how these can be implemented, in order to achieve results as quickly as possible. We have been talking about people in the Kaliningrad region and thinking about facilitation. A month ago, this House decided that visa facilitation should be allowed for cultural purposes. We have been talking about whether perhaps particular consideration should be given to young people here. These are all good suggestions to get the ball rolling, but they are no substitute for an overall solution. I would therefore urge the Commission to step up the pace. You can count on our support in any case, including as regards some of the more hesitant certain Member States. (Applause) Knut Fleckenstein  (S&amp;D
). 
 – (DE)
 Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, through its report on the cultural dimensions of the EU’s external actions, Parliament clarifies its aspiration to also put our own stamps on this developing policy field. The fact – and I want to put this carefully – that I do not see a representative of the External Action Service here today shows how necessary this report is. The report quite rightly urges that, in future, cultural aspects should play a more significant role in external policy, into which they should be more systematically incorporated. For my group, it was important to call for a coherent strategy that more effectively coordinates existing EU external policy programmes with cultural components, thereby taking account of cultural diversity in the EU. Mrs Pack has already made reference to this, saying that the existing structures in the Member States and between them, such as the EUNIC network of national institutes for culture, must be incorporated and that civil society must be seen as part of European external cultural policy. The EU’s motto of ‘United in diversity’ should also come to bear on the image that the Union projects to the outside world. We should also make even better use of the new media as a communications platform to that end. As we do all this, we need to make sure that art and culture do not become means to an end in external policy. It is our cultural values that characterise our European Community. It is therefore important and right that this cultural diversity and identity should also be disseminated outside the Union by its policies. I feel sure that we can achieve much more in this way, including in the debate about human rights and democracy, than through many cases of sabre-rattling, sometimes with absolutely nothing to back it up, in this House. Knut Fleckenstein  (S&amp;D
). 
 – (DE)
 Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I regret the fact that this debate was put on the agenda at such short notice that the High Representative for Foreign Affairs and Security Policy was not able to be here. In recent months, Baroness Ashton has worked with the Council to improve internal EU coordination on cooperation with our strategic partners, including Russia. With regard to her efforts to achieve a coordinated position, I think it would have been sensible to involve her in this debate. None of the other strategic partners of the EU is as close to us as Russia, either geographically or in relation to our historic experiences. This is why we take great interest in the internal political developments in Russia. At this point, I would like to make specific mention of the work programme drawn up jointly by the coordinators of the Partnership for Modernisation, both in Russia and in the EU. This joint work programme for modernisation contains important measures which will provide active support for the development of the rule of law in Russia. This is the right way of ensuring that our partnership brings real benefits, in particular, for the citizens. The initiative to modernise Russia launched by the Russian President gives the country’s international partners the opportunity to begin a fruitful cooperation with Russia. We must make use of this opportunity. As my fellow Members have already said, if the modernisation process is to be sustainable, it must not only be based on technological developments. A modern Russian economy must be founded on the reliable principles of the rule of law. Only when citizens and business people can rely on the rule of law will they have the courage to introduce innovations and make investments. Let us take the hand that Russia has reached out to us and help the country to modernise. Knut Fleckenstein  (S&amp;D
).

– Madam President, I will vote for the resolution, yes. Knut Fleckenstein  (S&amp;D

 – (DE)
 Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I would simply like to make three brief points, on behalf also of some of my colleagues on the Committee on Transport and Tourism. These are critical points that I would ask the representatives of the Commission to bring up in their discussions. The first is that although it has already been passed, the travel promotion tax is an unacceptable unilateral decision by the US Government. We hope that you can persuade it to think again on this. Secondly, the exclusion of Romania, Poland, Bulgaria and Cyprus from the visa waiver programme is something that the European Parliament cannot endorse, and, in our opinion, it should not be allowed to continue. Thirdly, we welcome the joint efforts to elaborate international security standards and to develop smart security concepts, but unilateral stipulations such as compulsory container scanning are not a solution because they are one-sided and disproportionate. The costs are out of all proportion to the benefit and it is unreasonable to expect this of European ports and enterprises. Knut Fleckenstein,  
on behalf of the S&amp;D Group

 Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, firstly I would like to congratulate Mrs Meissner on her report and thank her for all her hard work. We share the approach taken by this report which puts the focus not on the sectoral structure of maritime policy in the individual Member States, but instead emphasises the importance of coordinating maritime policy within and across the Member States. If we look to the future, we will see the space available in our seas and oceans becoming more restricted. The oceans are transport routes, sources of raw materials and energy, suppliers of foodstuffs and water reservoirs. The economic exploitation of the oceans is growing and this brings an accompanying increase in the environmental impact on them. Conflicts of interest will arise and we will have to resolve them by means of effective coordination within and among countries. It is not possible to comment on every issue, but I would like to mention briefly the sulphur emission control areas. It was not my intention to make the limits less strict. When the Commission presents its study, we will be able to tell to what extent the limits will result in a shift from sea to road transport, in particular in the North Sea and the Baltic. Then we can discuss this issue further. However, the basic conditions for competition within the European Union between the North and the South must remain at the same level. This must also be one of the Commission’s objectives. There is one point which we are not entirely happy about. We have been talking for a long time about the strategic importance of the shipbuilding industry in Europe. We have also said that innovation is very important in this industry, because this is the only way that it can survive. We need a coordinated strategy for our policy on the shipbuilding industry. I believe that the call from the Member States to put funding aside for shipbuilding was also very important, but it has not been supported by the Liberals and the Conservatives. Ladies and gentlemen, how do you propose that we should support the shipbuilding industry in Europe? Coming out with platitudes and good wishes for the workers in the European shipyards, who are concerned about their jobs, is simply not enough. We Social Democrats expect better measures and better proposals in this area. Knut Fleckenstein  (S&amp;D

 Mr President, I would just like to interrupt the debate very briefly to inform you and my fellow Members that last night, three terrorists stormed the Chechen Parliament, killing several security officers and taking hostages. The terrorists were also killed. Parliament ought to express its condemnation of this act of terrorism in no uncertain terms, because terrorism can never be justified. Our sympathy goes out to the families. I wanted to mention this briefly, especially in view of the fact that we will be discussing the Northern Caucasus again this week. I apologise for the interruption. Knut Fleckenstein  (S&amp;D
). 
 – (DE)
 Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I am pleased that we will be able to adopt this report with a large majority tomorrow. There are two things that I regard as being particularly important. The first is ensuring that the objectives we have set ourselves for 2020 can be measured. We need measurable principles which will allow us to take stock after ten years or, even better, halfway through the period, so that we can identify whether we have achieved some of what we set out to do or whether things have not worked out and we need to make improvements. This applies in particular to CO2
 emissions in the transport sector. If all the other sectors are making good progress, as Mr Cramer has said, then we can rightly call on the transport industry to do the same. European transport policy is of particular importance when it comes to reducing CO2
 emissions. The second point concerns the implementation of efficient comodality. For me, this is the key to a sensible EU transport strategy. I say this, because efficient comodality can have a number of different meanings. If we do not base this theoretical concept on the right criteria, which can be put into practice, we will not achieve our objective. Therefore, I am once again calling on the Commission to ensure that the concept is implemented correctly down to the last detail, which means developing useful intermodal nodes and removing the bottlenecks in the transport of goods to and from important European trade gateways. This particularly applies to the links between major ports and airports and their hinterlands. My third point is that the proposed core Trans-European Network (TEN) must be based on the same criteria, so that there is an almost automatic modal shift towards an efficient and environmentally friendly European transport system. These are the factors that make up a sensible plan. Not just cost effectiveness, but also social compatibility, environmental protection and sustainability. Mr Grosch and Mrs Alvarez, thank you very much for all your hard work. Knut Fleckenstein  (S&amp;D
).

 Madam President, Baroness Ashton, ladies and gentlemen, the EU-Russia Summit has produced reasonable results, in particular, as far as specifying the details of the Partnership for Modernisation is concerned. I very much welcome the fact that dialogue between the civil societies has been seen as a priority in this partnership. As the chair of the European Parliament delegation for relations with Russia, I led a working group meeting in Perm a few days ago specifically on the subject of developing the civil society. We have once again seen how much progress has been made in Russia in recent years, but also how much still remains to be done and how much we can contribute to the discussions on the basis of our experiences, both good and otherwise. Exchange and movement are key concepts for me. There can be no Partnership for Modernisation without the movement of people. For this reason, I am rather disappointed that the EU has not really made much progress in the area of travel without visas. We must now set specific objectives which the EU and Russia can work together to achieve. This is not about meeting schedules and certainly not about following certain sequences of events. It is all about ensuring that we take a predictable approach to these issues, that the criteria are clearly defined and that everyone, including Russia, can be sure that when these conditions are fulfilled and when the specific problems are solved, visa liberalisation will be possible.

 Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, first of all, we very much welcome the fact that, in future, we will have a maritime strategy in the EU, even if we will have to wait a little longer for the vote. We assume that this report will be incorporated into the Future of Transport report and then into the White Paper. Through the European Maritime Transport Strategy 2018, we are creating the framework to make the European maritime economy more competitive at international level, and in this strategy we have determined, firstly, that we want this framework to be set up on the basis of ecological standards and, secondly, that we want sensible global social standards for high quality shipping. Let me briefly address three points. Firstly, shipping is an environmentally friendly transport sector and therefore, one of our aims was for this branch of the economy to play its part in combating climate change in future, too. I am very much in favour of us creating incentives like the green ports, even if we do not make any decisions today but rather assign the Commission and the Council the task of finding out what is possible in this regard. I believe it is just as important to maintain international competitiveness – including in respect of other modes of transport. It is therefore also right for the Commission, on the basis of our proposal, to once again carry out an impact assessment in respect of the sulphur emission control areas in the North Sea and the Baltic Sea because, if we want higher requirements here than elsewhere, we need to take international competition into account and ensure that, if possible, we do not cause the transport of containers to move back to the roads, which would be counterproductive. Allow me to mention one last thing that I feel is particularly important, namely the inclusion of the major European ports in the planning of the TEN networks. This is of such enormous importance to us because the ports are important intersections in the transport chains and they can only perform their role effectively if intermodality is facilitated and reinforced. There are numerous other points that I could mention here. Mr van Dalen, congratulations on this excellent report. We have all contributed a little to it and I would ask for your understanding for the fact that we do not want to spoil this excellent report by accepting your amendments. Knut Fleckenstein  (S&amp;D

 Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, the previous speakers have already clearly highlighted many points and problems, such as the human rights situation. It is important for us to make these points clearly, as only then will we be able to have an open and frank debate. If Russia is currently once again seriously discussing introducing the death penalty according to the US model, we cannot neglect to express our opinion on this. I have two brief points to make. My first point relates to Russia’s accession to the WTO and my sincere request, including to the Council and the Commission, is to provide as much support as possible for this. Of course, Russia must play its part, too, but we are both relying on this and it would be good for both of us if developments in this regard were to move in a positive direction. The fact that Russia wants to join the WTO and not just enter into a customs union with Belarus and Kazakhstan is a step in the right direction. My second point is a sincere request for us not to lose sight of the development of our cooperation in the areas of science and research as well as in the area of civil society. We need a new impetus for cultural exchange as well as youth exchanges, not only in one direction, as Mr Gahler said, but in both directions. Every young person who takes part in this will develop an understanding for others and will become a messenger for a more positive development of our relations. I hope that we will talk more about these common interests and that these aspects will also assume greater importance. Matthias Groote,  
rapporteur.

Mr President, Commissioner, President-in-Office of the Council, ladies and gentlemen, it is a well-established and fine tradition that we adopt a joint resolution in advance of climate conferences and prepare the delegation. Yesterday, we held a final meeting which was attended by the Commissioner and also the President of this House. My colleagues with experience in these matters tell me this was a first! With his contribution, the President sent out a strong signal that the full backing of the House is ensured and that we are taking on an important role in relation to COP 18, in that we will be holding discussions with as many international representatives as possible there and will also exercising our powers of persuasion. That really is essential. We hope that after tomorrow, we will be able to take with us a strong resolution that offers clear solutions. We have a duty to provide answers, for climate change can only be combated and halted through international cooperation. The conference in Doha will take place from 26 November to 7 December, and I am keen to see which positions China will adopt and which positions the US will adopt now that the President has been returned to office for a second term. How will they position themselves, and how will we then respond to the issues raised, and so on?  We have just held an interesting debate about Europe’s financial future. This debate is relevant to us in Doha as well, for as is well-known, friendship stops where money begins. Where climate change is concerned, however, friendship begins in earnest. We must find answers to the question of how the fast-start period will continue to be financed after 2012. A great deal of money will be required here. However, it is important to emphasise, as always, that the deceptive aspect of climate change is that its effects are not felt immediately. Even if we were to adopt a decision tomorrow that CO2
 emissions will be reduced by 50 % immediately, the effects would not be felt until very much later. Climate change and the financial crisis therefore have one feature in common: they will both cost a great deal of money.  If we continue to prevaricate, also in the international arena, and do not manage to find a workable way forward in Doha, this will prove very costly for the international community and is likely to have extremely adverse effects for a great many people. It may even cost lives. Failure, therefore, is not an option. However, we should not demand too much, that much is clear. At previous conferences, we learned that we have to take small steps. However, the largest step that the industrialised nations must take is to deal with the future financing and safeguards for adaptation measures and climate action. Clearly, we remain committed to the 2° target. However, with a ‘business as usual’ approach, 3.5° or 4° is the more likely outcome, and no expert in the world can tell us the exact number of degrees at which we cause irreparable damage to the planet.  I am most grateful to the Commissioner. Last week, we held a lengthy debate on how we wish to proceed internally with our emissions trading scheme. However, there is movement at the international level as well, and this applies to various sectors. I welcome the fact that we appear to be on track, here in the EP, towards a solution for aviation, which I hope will be achieved as quickly as possible, ideally before the conference. However, aviation is an international business, and if there is the possibility of achieving a global agreement here, we should stop the clock, as the Commissioner has rightly pointed out, but of course only for a short time. In that case, it is essential to ensure that the international negotiations produce a genuinely workable arrangement, with a workable decision being taken by the International Civil Aviation Organisation (ICAO), resulting in an international agreement. Otherwise, the clocks will start ticking again in autumn next year and the legislation will proceed. I would also like to respond to the fellow Members who described this as ‘giving way’. Let me say this: ‘giving way’ looks very different. I believe this was a wise decision which this House should support. I believe it sends out a signal for the debates in Doha and shows, once again, that we are willing to compromise here. A further important point relates to climate diplomacy, which the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Food Safety included in the resolution. This means that we are following this issue at all levels, including the European External Action Service (EEAS), and it is always a topic of discussion at all the international meetings. The parliamentary delegation is very well prepared. I very much hope that everyone, including the Commission, will ensure that the parliamentary delegation is fully involved in all the daily briefings so that we have a lively exchange. Our role in Doha will be to convince as many people as possible in positions of responsibility outside the European Union that our ideas are the right ones, and advocate for a global agreement, so that a second commitment period can begin. That is crucial in order to combat climate change and achieve successes. Matthias Groote  (S&amp;D

Mr President, the timing of today’s session leaves something to be desired. I have never experienced us being over an hour late before. In this regard, blue cards should indeed be used freely, but should also not be misused.  With regard to fracking, the debate reminds me a little of that relating to nuclear power – yes or no. I must say, however, that just because something is technically possible, that does not mean it has to be done. The protection of health and the environment must therefore take absolute priority over any immature technologies, and that is what I see when it comes to fracking. My greatest reservations concern the impact on the environment. What we are lacking is a sensible regulatory framework. We have various policy areas: Member States are responsible for the energy mix, but we are responsible for environmental policy. We have gaps in the water framework legislation. We have no mining law. I believe it is appropriate and timely for the Commission to think about how we can close these gaps, to create legal certainty and to ensure maximum protection for health and the environment. This – as I see it, anyway – is not the case with regard to fracking! A potential energy supply of the future cannot, however, be created at the cost of the environment or health. Furthermore, if you look at how many accidents and risks there are in the United States with the 50 000 existing well-bores, I must say that we should give careful consideration to how we get involved in this technology and what the protective framework for this future technology should be. Matthias Groote  (S&amp;D

Mr President, last Wednesday, the Nordseewerke shipyard in Emden had to file for bankruptcy because, to its surprise, a guarantee by the Lower Saxon Land Government was not extended. That undertaking, with 700 skilled jobs, is in the process of transforming from a shipyard to a supplier of offshore wind energy. And it is now thought that this undertaking can be saved by a large loan and that the jobs can also be saved, for the 700 SIAG and Nordseewerke workers have already had to accept substantial cuts in their pay. That is why I ask the Commission to take a favourable and also an early look at this procedure, to ensure that these 700 jobs are not put at risk, because they are needed in order to organise the energy revolution and sustainable energy on the seas of Europe. Please do not let the workers there suffer from the Land government’s poor crisis management. Matthias Groote  (S&amp;D

 Mr President, air quality is an important topic in the European Union, particularly in the coming year, which is the Year of Air. We should take heed of this and work to ensure that progress is made in this area. However, we also have to take into account the fact that maritime transport is currently facing one of its most severe crises. I have major concerns regarding the technology that is to be used to provide clean air. In this area, we must make sure – and that includes in the financial perspective – that alternatives are pointed out. As my fellow Member has just said, LNG is a very good alternative in the Sulphur Emission Control Areas (SECAs). However, for this we need research and development. It is also an economic recovery plan for our shipyards, particularly in the case of scrubber technology, which has not got that far yet. I sometimes get the feeling that some of my fellow Members believe that the required technology is just sitting on the shelf waiting to be used. It is not. I would therefore like to see greater focus on promoting technology, so that we really can have clean air in our ports and port cities. Please would you also pay heed to who foots the bill at the end of the day. Matthias Groote  (S&amp;D
).

 Mr President, the best kind of energy is energy that is not used in the first place. We are not talking here about saving energy, but about using energy more efficiently. There is one aspect of this where I would like us to have gone further, and that is in the public sector. There is huge potential here, a huge backlog of investments among our local authorities. I would have liked to have seen Parliament being more ambitious in this regard. We have pushed through this procedure, partly unnecessarily. One Member – one of the shadow rapporteurs – has mentioned it already; I even thought he wanted to vote against the whole compromise. If it is all so terrible, why did he then not push for a second reading? I would have liked the community to take such an important matter to second reading, so that the whole package could be discussed with the chambers and guilds. Greater transparency in this area would really have done us good. That is what I would like to see happen next time. The rapporteurs have made their decision, but I would like to remind Members that two readings are actually the rule in this House. In this parliamentary term, it has become the exception. We should take that to heart and think about it sometime. Matthias Groote  (S&amp;D

 Mr President, we debated the preparations for the Rio+20 conference intensively in our respective bodies within the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Food Safety. It must be said however, that, in the final analysis, the result achieved in Rio is fairly unimpressive. Mr Prodi expressed our disappointment in a nutshell, calling it Rio minus 20! Some NGOs described the result the same way. What has been achieved in the conference is really very little indeed. Firstly, we need to consider whether there is much point holding conferences in this format. We have been through Copenhagen, which was a disaster, and now we have had Rio+20: we are moving from one disappointment to the next. I think that the upgrading of the UN Environment Programme, putting it on an almost equal footing with the WHO, is the right approach, as it will give this organisation more authority and more enforcement powers than was previously the case. This is a very important point. We are going to witness the world’s population grow to 9 billion. We are heading for a catastrophe if things keep going like this. If more and more people live in industrialised nations and want access to energy and if we do not take radical steps to avert this, we shall encounter enormous problems. That is why we need a new development strategy. There has been no public debate on this issue, even in advance of Rio. When I consider what we voted on yesterday – ACTA – and the number of e-mails and letters, etc. we received on this issue, then I believe that we also need to move towards a sustainable planet in the digital community too. After all, this world is the only one we have got. We can play our part here by changing our strategy and bringing more people along with us, and then perhaps the Angela Merkels of this world will travel to the next summit and really put their heads together to produce concrete results. Matthias Groote  (S&amp;D
). 
 – (DE) 
Mr President, I would also like to express my sincere thanks to the shadow rapporteurs and the rapporteur. This report was adopted by the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Food Safety with an absolute majority of 62 votes in favour, no votes against and no abstentions. This shows that we are actually very much at one with regard to the compromises. Of course, we must give the greatest priority in this legislative process to the provision of high level consumer protection for the younger members of society, in other words children, who need special consideration. Gluten intolerance is a problem, particularly in nurseries. If we look around us – I myself have two children in this age group – we will be aware of the allergies and intolerances that arise, which is why I believe that we have chosen the right approach. We should continue to discuss this in the second reading, also involving the Council and Commission. I believe that we will then also achieve positive results. Matthias Groote  (S&amp;D
). 
 – (DE)
 Mr President, Seveso, Enschede, Toulouse – these places are synonymous with major disasters that result not just in environmental disaster, but also in loss of life and the destruction of private property. That is why we must do everything we can to reduce the risk, as well as the likelihood, of such accidents being repeated. How do we do that? Firstly, we must allow even unscheduled inspections, and it must not be simply routine. The people who live close to such industrial establishments must be very well informed of what is going on there, what happens there. In the event of an incident, we must make sure that the situation is clarified promptly. This is very important, because it can save human lives. I think the Council has not done itself any favours here. I also think the Council should be here for this debate in Parliament. Apparently, however, other things are more important. I think the Council might have saved face if it had explained why this legislation has been watered down. That is what I would have liked to see. However, strong legislation in this area will also create confidence. This confidence is needed when the Member States plan large infrastructure projects. At such times, there are always major reservations among the population. Strong legislation here, such as we have achieved today, creates confidence; and that is only possible where there is the greatest possible degree of transparency. It also requires authorities to be better networked with each other, to cooperate more with each other; we also need more communication, and dealing with such large, dangerous establishments must never become routine. We must not allow that to happen. Matthias Groote  (S&amp;D
),  
Blue-card question
. – (DE)
 A blue card, because we have now heard a great many critical voices. I know that Mr Seeber has dealt with the procedure in Parliament very well, having taken this over from János Áder. My question is simply: we are now concluding this at first reading, as we do for as much as 65% of our environmental legislation. My question to the rapporteur is whether we might not perhaps have been able to achieve greater transparency, even though the Council took a blocking attitude, if we had taken it to a second reading? This is a fundamental issue. Richard, I realise that you took this over. However, I would like to hear the current rapporteur’s view on this. Matthias Groote  (S&amp;D
). 
 – (DE)
 Mr President, Commissioner, rapporteur, shadow rapporteur, the spirit is willing, but the flesh is weak. That is what you could say about resource conservation. Everyone wants to move in the right direction, but how do we get there? Voluntary measures – as we have seen time and time again, in the automotive industry, in other areas – have been a resounding failure. Resource efficiency and the conservation of resources are an element of foreign policy, security policy, health policy, environmental policy, economic policy, agricultural policy – they affect all areas. Looking at the empty Council benches, I can only say that I am astonished that the Council is not here today, but perhaps things will take a bit longer, because they are missing something today – namely, the presentation and debate on a very, very good report by Mr Gerbrandy. This topic is by no means dealt with yet, and this matter will decide whether Europe lives in prosperity in future and what our environment in Europe will look like. It is now a matter of finding the instruments. The internalisation of external costs – there is no way around it: this principle must be introduced. Anyone who pollutes water or air must pay for it. At the moment, we pay for it via our health insurance or through other areas – we are paying for it with our taxes, Ms Gardini. This has to be internalised, and here we need to be courageous for once, because only then will we deal with the future challenges that we face. A growing world population – not in Europe, we will get smaller in the future – is a huge challenge, and therefore this report that Mr Gerbrandy has produced is a good starting point for considering new political strategies, and that applies to the Commission, too. We have to think in terms of life cycles – instead of simply regulating what comes out of the exhaust, we also need to look at the factory where the car is manufactured. Is that sustainable, does it conserve resources? We must think in terms of complete cycles and be courageous about this and not stick with the status quo
 – because if we do, we will pay very, very dearly for it. (Applause) Matthias Groote  (S&amp;D
). 
 – (DE) 
Madam President, firstly, I would like to congratulate Mr Gerbrandy. This is a very good report and it gives us guidelines as to how we should act in forthcoming legislative procedures and during major reform processes. The litmus test will come when we discuss agricultural reform. Many of the speeches today have already made this clear. This is where we will have the opportunity to do more to promote biodiversity and to show our other partners, for example, at the Rio+20 conference, that we take this subject seriously. The Heads of State or Government agreed in 2001 that biodiversity must be protected. Unfortunately, we have failed to achieve this objective. The window of opportunity is gradually closing and it is time for us to act. The problem will not be resolved solely by this strategy. The whole issue must be incorporated into the reform of fisheries and agriculture policy and given a more concrete form. Matthias Groote  (S&amp;D
).  
– (DE)
 Mr President, it is important that resource efficiency is also included in the 7th Environment Action Programme (EAP), which is what we have been discussing today. I hope that we will vote in plenary in the same way as we voted in the committee and that the Rio+20 conference will be a great success. Following the discussions with the environment ministers this week, I am in a very positive mood. We should design the 7th EAP accordingly and include the concrete decisions which we hope will be made in Rio, in other words, the international dimension. As far as doing business sustainably is concerned, we need to introduce an end-to-end approach, for example, in car manufacturing. We must consider the car from production right through to recycling. To achieve this, we need a legislative framework. The 7th EAP is a good location for this framework, which can then be applied when the relevant legislation is revised. Matthias Groote  (S&amp;D
). 
 – (DE)
 Mr President, we are discussing the changeover to a low-emissions economy. We have heard a number of people today tell us that we should continue as before. Mr Davies’ report contains an important point: if we continue as before, this will cost 5% of gross domestic product in the future. A full 5% of gross domestic product if we continue as before! Accordingly, the contents of the report represent a start. Naturally we are only responsible for 12% of emissions. However, if someone does not make a start, no one will. There will be a battle for resources and the lower our emissions in the future, the fewer raw materials we will consume. There will also be a radical economic impact if we fail to take evasive action, investing in renewable energies and reducing emissions from traffic. We have made a start here. This is a difficult path, both within the EU and internationally, which is why we need more diplomatic activity around climate issues. The European External Action Service needs to play its part in ensuring more is done with regard to climate-related diplomacy. We resolved here to include aviation in the Emissions Trading System. At present this is encountering international resistance – to put things diplomatically. Nonetheless, we are on the right track. If the US, Russia and India develop a similar system, then we will of course be willing to cooperate with them and to show them the hand of friendship. Nonetheless, someone has to make a start. That is what we have done. It will also be evident in economic terms that we made a start in good time. This is a good report and everyone in the Chamber today bears some responsibility in making this report a success. We cannot afford for the report to fail, like its predecessor, the Eickhout report. That would be a completely destructive signal to the citizens of Europe and the world’s public at large. Hence my call to all my fellow Members: each of us must move a little from our positions if this report is to be a success. Matthias Groote,

 Mr President, I am grateful to the Commissioner for the opportunity to debate this important topic today. In my country, Germany, 900 holdings are affected by the Schmallenberg virus and the numbers are growing. Naturally there are also signs of fear in the public debate in relation to the agricultural sector, ranging from loss of income to complete loss of livelihood, as well as public health concerns. After all, it is not possible to offer a 100% guarantee that this virus will not affect humans. The European Food Safety Authority has already announced that it wishes to work closely with the European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control in order to keep a close eye on the impact on public health. I believe that this is very important. A monitoring procedure does exist and has been simulated once by EFSA. We have just heard that eight Member States have been affected by this disease so far, and our fears are that the outbreak will spread as the flying insect population increases in spring and summer. A number of different scenarios have been identified. Can the Commission indicate precisely what steps it will take to combat the situations revealed in the simulation? Perhaps you are still at the analysis stage? This is a very important point. It is also important that the general public should see that steps are being taken to control this disease. I am aware that this is something new, and that we do not have specific means for combating this disease. Nonetheless, I would ask what steps is the Commission planning, or has it already taken to ensure that this disease does not spread to all 27 Member States? Eight countries are affected so far and we do not want to see the disease spread to all 27 Member States. Matthias Groote  (S&amp;D

 Madam President, Mr Duff has presented us with a visionary and – as he said himself – radical proposal for the reform of the electoral system. I believe that that is a good thing; we need proposals and we need more Europe in European politics. However, the reality currently looks rather different: 18 fellow Members are still waiting to be able to come here to Parliament and we are already talking about expanding Parliament by another 25 Members. I think it is good that this report, most of which I support, will be debated once again in the Committee on Constitutional Affairs and that we will then adopt this Duff report here with a broad majority the third time around, because we need a uniform electoral system. I would like to share many of Mr Duff’s visions with him. Hopefully, we will adopt the final report in the second half of this year and then also implement it. However, I believe that we need a broad majority, not just a slight majority, because then we will really make ourselves heard with this proposal. Matthias Groote,

 Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, firstly I would like to thank the rapporteur and all those involved in this process because tomorrow, after the vote, a long period of hard work will finally come to a conclusion. This is a good day for Europe, for the European Parliament as an institution, and for the Commission because we have succeeded in getting a common transparency register off the ground. This an important step along the way, but more work needs to be done. I would like to address two points. The first is that the register is not really mandatory. This needs to be stated openly at this point. I have a question for the Commissioner in this regard: the Commission has always claimed that the appropriate legal framework for this does not exist. Is the Commission ready to establish such a legal framework, so that we will have a mandatory register after the revision? I was very pleased by the statement from the Council indicating that it does not foresee any difficulty in joining our register, as Mr Weber has just pointed out. I am hopeful that the Council will follow through on this, because the register will really only be complete if all three institutions of the European Union have a common register and if this register is also mandatory. As a group, we favour the amendment brought forward by another group requiring that the money spent on lobbying should also be listed in the transparency register; we intend supporting this amendment. As far as the various national lobby groups are concerned, it has been clearly stated that these will not be included in the register. I would like to thank all my fellow Members for their willingness to compromise on this matter. It really would have been a black mark for such an agreement if national lobby groups were treated in the same way as industry lobbyists or other professional associations. Matthias Groote  (S&amp;D

Madam President, I would like to thank Mr Duff for bringing up the issue of the legislative footprint. Do you believe that a legislative footprint, the extent of which still has to be defined, might also restrict the work of the European Parliament? Also: how far-reaching do you expect the impact of the legislative footprint to be? Matthias Groote,  
on behalf of the S&amp;D Group.
 – (DE)
 Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I would like to start by expressing my gratitude for the way in which we have been able to work together so constructively. We have reached a good compromise today from an environmental and an economic perspective. Even though we could, in my opinion, have gone further with regard to the limit, the legislation that we are adopting today is still the strictest in the world for light commercial vehicles. We must not forget that. Mrs Hedegaard has already said that, outside the Emissions Trading System, these small sector-specific pieces of legislation which we are introducing are very important in allowing us to achieve the goals that we have set ourselves. If vehicles use less fuel, this brings added value not only for the climate but also for air quality. With a limit of 147 grams, which is the equivalent of 5.6 litres of diesel, vehicles will produce less pollution. This means that the air quality in our cities will improve. We are taking an important step forward today. My group is voting in favour of this compromise package because it includes an important point which states that we must evaluate in 2014 at the latest whether the targets that we are adopting today have been met or exceeded and whether we need to make adjustments in this area. This was a fundamental requirement for our group. I have had long discussions with my colleague, Mr Pirillo, about the nature of this compromise and that was one of the basic prerequisites of the compromise package. Some comments have already been made about the first reading. We should make sure in future that we reach fewer first-reading agreements. In this case, it is acceptable because the negotiations ultimately only concerned 2 grams. We did not need to introduce that into the second reading. However, if we adopt everything during the first reading, Parliament will be depriving itself of its rights. There is one further point I would like to mention and that is the test cycle. It will be very important for us to have a standardised test cycle in future which will hopefully come into force throughout the world at some point and which will represent reality. Our current test cycles are not realistic and we need to make improvements in this area. International negotiations are under way and I hope that they can be brought to successful conclusion, because this will mean that the legislation will reflect the actual driving cycles. I would like to thank everyone concerned once again. Today is a good day for the European Union’s climate and environmental policy. Matthias Groote  (S&amp;D

Madam President, firstly I would like to thank everyone who has made this possible and, in particular, the former vice-president Sylvia-Yvonne Kaufmann, who did much of the preliminary work during the previous parliamentary term to ensure that the day would come when the European citizens’ initiative would become reality. Sometimes the citizens of the EU feel as if Europe and its institutions are very remote. This instrument, the European citizens’ initiative, will bring the institutions closer to the citizens. This is an excellent instrument which will strengthen democracy, involve people more and enable them to take the initiative. I believe that two things will be very important over the next few months. One is creating access, including digital access, to the citizens’ initiative over the Internet in a way which makes it easy to use but is also secure. The second is that if a citizens’ initiative is successful, it should be followed by a legal act. My question to the Commission is therefore as follows: How will we decide in future which initiatives will result in a legal act and which simply in a hearing? Perhaps you could explain this, Mr Šefčovič. I would also like to thank you once again for your work and for the work done by the Council. Matthias Groote  (S&amp;D

 I voted in favour of the report on the restriction of the use of certain hazardous substances in electrical and electronic equipment (RoHS), because the extension of the area of application to cover all electronic equipment represents a definite improvement. However, I find the fact that there are so many exceptions problematic. In particular in the area of renewable energies, photovoltaic modules, which consist in part of cadmium telluride compounds, are not covered by this directive. This substance is not only harmful to health, it is also hazardous and therefore really ought to be placed within the scope of the RoHS Directive. The danger that, as a result, photovoltaic installations would have to completely disappear from roofs would not arise. Rather, there are numerous cadmium telluride-free alternatives on the market. I therefore disagree in this regard with the decision of the majority in Parliament and the Council. Matthias Groote  (S&amp;D

Madam President, the democratic participation of employees in business is one of the cornerstones of social policy in the European Union. For a month now, workers at the Atlas plants in Ganderkesee, Delmenhorst and Vechta have been striking day and night for precisely these rights. Workers are fighting to secure a collective wage agreement that will enable good, secure jobs to be preserved. Unfortunately, the management has refused point blank to negotiate with the Industrial Union of Metalworkers and the works council. During the course of the industrial dispute, employees have been extremely intimidated and pressurised by management. I wish to call on the management, specifically Mr Filipov, to open discussions and to return to the negotiating table. Democratic participation cannot be allowed to stop at the factory gates. A hire-and-fire system engenders fear and sows the seeds of social unrest. There should be no place for such systems in Europe, as they are damaging to our democracy. Matthias Groote  (S&amp;D

 I voted against the Gallo report because I cannot support measures that have even remotest chance of resulting in people having their Internet access blocked or in the loss of the neutrality of the Internet. Moreover, the report makes no distinction between commercial and non-commercial file sharing, thereby criminalising private Internet users. Furthermore, the report does not contain a definition of the word ‘piracy’, which could counteract such hasty criminalisation. In contrast, the report makes recourse to demands from the very controversial ACTA agreement and to the call for the acceleration of the negotiations. I cannot support such a report.

Madam President, Commissioner, we have gathered here today at this late hour shortly before midnight to debate the subject of climate change. It is a subject that has moved into the background somewhat. We have had a financial and economic crisis – in fact, we are still in it – but nonetheless, this subject is an important one. That is also why my fellow Members have asked what line the Commission intends to take at the forthcoming ICAO negotiations. As Mr Liese has just outlined, here in Parliament, we have long grappled with reaching a compromise on the inclusion of aviation in the emissions trading system. We have conducted delicate negotiations with the Council. I feel that we also need to make this clear to the outside world – indeed internationally. As far as ICAO is concerned, and as far as reducing CO2
 emissions from aviation is concerned, my feeling is that so far, a lot of time has been invested in this, but with minimal results. We therefore need to defend our proposal on the international stage in the same way as it was defended here in Parliament, where it was adopted with a large majority. The European system will come into effect in 2012 and we have included third countries in it. That means that if an aircraft takes off in Washington and lands in the European Union, then it will fall within the emissions trading system of the European Union. Climate change is a global problem, and consequently, it is a problem that must be tackled globally. If we are serious about doing so, then we need to develop fiscal instruments. We have imposed duties on small vehicles, such as cars and lorries. Unfortunately, we are not in a position to develop uniform tax rates in Europe. I am therefore under no illusions that there is any possibility of developing an international CO2
 tax. Instead, the second best solution is therefore emissions trading, ideally globally, with rules covering third countries. These rules on third countries must also be defended tooth and nail by the European Commission and by the Council, which unfortunately, is not present at this late hour. The US is an international player. The Obama administration initially set its sights high where climate legislation is concerned. To date, however, this has not been followed up by action. The ball is now in the US’s court as regards getting climate legislation under way and harmonising and fine-tuning it internationally. This is very important. The UN climate conference in Copenhagen was a flop, as we all know. It was not crowned with success. I fear that ICAO and Annex 16 of the ICAO Agreement, which regulates environmental measures, will also be a flop. Therefore, my question to the Commission is as follows: if no agreement is reached this time regarding the inclusion of aviation in emissions trading, is the Commission actually prepared to continue negotiating at ICAO level? Is there a Plan B in this event? How will the European Commission and also the Council react in this event? Matthias Groote and Bernhard Rapkay  (S&amp;D

 The German Social Democratic (SPD) delegation in the European Parliament is in favour of combating international terrorism and providing permanent protection for personal data with the highest possible degree of determination and effectiveness. In view of the importance of data protection, the SPD delegation did not make its decision lightly. After long and careful consideration, however, we are now able to vote in favour of the agreement: the Social Democrats have succeeded in providing for the establishment of permanent European monitoring in connection with the extraction of the data directly on the ground in the US Treasury Department – including the facility to stop the extraction of data. For us, the top priority was limiting the transfer of bulk data. SEPA data are not covered by the agreement; most transfers are not affected at all. The five-year data retention period is intended to be reviewed annually, whereby any data that is not needed is to be deleted sooner than this. In addition, an annual review of compliance with all data protection standards, with the involvement of data protection supervisors, is provided for. Even though we would have preferred the monitoring role and the transfer of data to be given to a judicial authority, Europol must carry out its mandate for approving the data transfer, provided for in the agreement, under the strict scrutiny of the EU. Although Europol has a reliable data protection system, it needs to be brought into line with the Treaty of Lisbon so that it can perform its duties under full democratic scrutiny.

 Mr President, it was not possible for me to vote ‘No’ in the vote because the voting machine only displayed something once I had pressed the ‘Yes’ button followed by the ‘Abstention’ button. Please would you check once again how the machine is collecting and counting the votes, because in my opinion, it was not conclusive. I was not the only one who found this; a number of other Members had the same experience. They were unable to press the ‘Abstention’ button or the ‘No’ button, but instead had to vote ‘Yes’ first. It makes this voting process rather hazardous. Please would you therefore check again how the votes were counted. Matthias Groote  (S&amp;D

Madam President, first of all I should like to thank the rapporteur, Mr Méndez de Vigo. I see no need to convene a convention. It is a matter of detail that needs to be clarified. Since 1979, the European Parliament has been elected in a direct and secret ballot and that is the way it should continue to be done in future, too. We and the Council would be well advised to deal with this problem as quickly as possible at an intergovernmental conference, because out of the 18 Members, 16 are in a state of suspense, which is rather intolerable. The ball is therefore back in the Council’s court. I would ask the Council not to give in on this point because one Member State has failed to find clear rules on account of it expecting the Treaty of Lisbon to enter into force sooner. I am pleased that we now have this Treaty in place, but we now have our homework to do. The Méndez de Vigo report is a good basis for strengthening this process. However, the Council would be well advised not to succumb to the temptation to accept Members being sent here from a national parliament. That would set a precedent and I am not happy to accept that. Therefore, the rapporteur has my full support, with the proviso that no Members be sent here from national parliaments. Matthias Groote  (S&amp;D

 Madam President, Commissioner, Mr Carlgren, ladies and gentlemen, the subject of climate change will keep us occupied much longer than the financial and economic crisis. There are parallels – both cost lots of money, and Copenhagen will be about reaching an agreement on the financial tools for the third world and the developing countries. The Copenhagen conference must succeed, and we can play our part in achieving that. Yesterday, we did a good job, we adopted the resolution in the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Food Safety by a large majority, and I think that the resolution will achieve a large majority here in Parliament, and in so doing, we will change the political climate as Copenhagen approaches. There is often a psychological side to it, and we should all play our part in that. I do still have one specific concern. In the European Parliament, we have worked to get aviation included in emissions trading, and in the end we succeeded. I therefore call on the Commission and the Council to ensure that this subject is pursued consistently in Copenhagen. We must achieve international agreement to the effect that shipping, and also aviation, are incorporated into the successor treaty to the Kyoto Protocol. This is because these two transport sectors are growing to a disproportionate degree and are therefore contributing in a disproportionate way to global warming. We should not exceed the 2 degree Celsius mark. That, in fact, is where the parallels between the financial crisis and climate change cease. If we go over this mark, we will have done irreparable damage to our planet and that means that it is damage that we will not be able to reverse. Matthias Groote  (S&amp;D

 Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, I very much liked what the Commissioner described here today with regard to the Desertec project. This project has huge potential and its appeal indeed lies in the fact that it is made up of many separate small projects. This will create jobs and will prepare the way for the environmentally sound industrial policy that we are striving for. I have a question for the Commission. When you were talking about the Desertec project, I had the feeling that the handbrake was on to some extent. What concrete measures are planned with regard to network infrastructure, which is a massive problem in connection with the development of renewable energy? The idea is, of course, to transmit the electricity to Europe via high voltage direct current lines from the deserts. What supporting measures can the European Commission take with regard to this? Is something already being considered in this regard? What can we expect from the next Commission in this area? Matthias Groote  (S&amp;D

 Madam President, Commissioners, ladies and gentlemen, this is, of course, not the first time that we have debated the subject of Opel and the car industry. I am pleased that the rescue succeeded. There were other proposals on the table, such as a structured insolvency. In the supply industry – and I have just come from Bavaria, where I visited a supply company – people are very urgently dependent on orders. Things have got out of control. If Opel, too, had been driven to insolvency, things would have been very, very bad and the consequences would have been devastating. We have just heard the Commission’s conclusions. There was a car industry summit, in which the Commission took part, but we actually heard nothing after the summit. Today we have heard where the problem may lie. what is not possible. That must change in future – we need to hear from the Commission what is possible, so as to forestall nationalistic debates. The Commission needs to mediate more effectively so that we pursue a common European industrial policy. That is also what I hope for from the next Commission. Norbert Glante,

 Mr President, Commissioner, I would like to apologise. The Parliament building’s lifts were very busy. Perhaps the manufacturers should think about including a priority override function. That is why I am a little late. Commissioner, I am much obliged to you for answering these pressing questions. Forgive me if I repeat myself a little, but I simply want to emphasise a point – I believe that the GMES (Global Monitoring for Environment and Security) programme is one of the two leading initiatives in the European Union’s space policy and is of key importance for the monitoring of the Earth. This, in turn, is an indispensable instrument in the fight against climate change, environmental pollution, disaster prevention and security, sustainable development, mobility and crisis management. GMES was established as a Union programme and will receive funding of about EUR 3.2 billion from the budget until 2013. The lack of a workable financial plan for long-term, solid financial support would probably mean that the costs will rise in the long term. The programme and the associated supply of data could be temporarily suspended or even abandoned entirely. In the final analysis, this could mean that the investments previously made will have been in vain. Europe could lose its independence and technological edge in relation to this important space infrastructure. What is at issue? We are talking about a sum of EUR 5.8 billion for the period 2014 to 2020, admittedly a very large amount of money, but one that offers a very substantial economic benefit. Despite the current budgetary difficulties in many Member States, GMES must be sufficiently financed in the budget and through the financial perspective. Mr Barnier, you wrote us a letter recently. If I might quote you: ‘Europe should not be satisfied with defensive answers to the crisis – however important this may be – Europe must also open up the prospect of new growth for its citizens!’ This idea could be expressed very succinctly. It is possible to drive oneself to destruction through excessive savings. This principle applies in a different context to an important Member State of the European Union. If GMES is to be run on an intergovernmental basis in future outside the budget, so that Parliament would no longer have a say in the project, then, in my opinion, the European space strategy would be doomed before it even began. This is why we are calling for a legislative proposal from the Commission for the long-term administration, financing and implementation of GMES and the embedding of the budget in medium-term financial planning. The Danish Presidency announced conclusions for the Competitiveness Council on 21 February and then cancelled them again because there was no majority in the Council. Some Member States question whether the Council Working Party on Space should be responsible for this project, which I find particularly surprising. Unfortunately, this development in the Council has given rise to two camps. One camp, a group of Member States that fund GMES through the budget, has also written to you. A second group wants to follow the proposal tabled by the Commission. If this stalemate continues, I fear that GMES may fail and that an enormous opportunity will have been lost. This is quite apart from the fact that many millions of euro already spent on the project will have been spent for nothing. The greatest risk, however, is that we will set a precedent, and that the Member States will use this to justify activities outside of the Treaty of Lisbon. I thought we had put these times behind us. I have three demands. Firstly, I hope that we, the European Parliament, will be courageous enough to continue to finance the major projects of the EU, such as GMES, but also Galileo and ITER, through the budget and to establish separate budget lines with sufficient reserves for this purpose. Secondly, I hope and demand that the Commission tables this legislative proposal as soon as possible. Thirdly, I call on the Council to push through reasonable and sufficient funding within the budget and to take the necessary decision. Norbert Glante,  
rapporteur.

 Mr President, I want to keep this brief. I know Members are not always pleased when the rapporteur speaks again before the vote. I simply wanted to thank all those involved and, in this context, I hope that this signal can soon be put to use so that there are enough satellites in orbit, and that the Member States come up with sufficient money for the future budget and the financial perspective so that the Galileo navigation satellite system is actually put into operation. Many thanks once again; I hope we have a bright future ahead of us. Norbert Neuser  (S&amp;D

 Mr President, Baroness Ashton, you spoke about how important it is to bring about peace in the Middle East. You said that the Middle East Quartet is playing a positive role and that the EU should support Jordan and the Quartet. The Israeli Government claims that it is in favour of a responsible peace process and a two-state solution, but the reality looks rather different. The Gaza Strip is still an open-air prison. The EU and the United Nations are constantly providing more money to feed the people in Gaza and the Israeli army has destroyed aid projects set up by the EU in occupied Palestinian territory in recent years which cost EUR 50 million. The aim of these aid projects was to provide better living conditions for the Palestinians and they included schools, infrastructure and education projects. We owe it to our taxpayers in the EU to make it clear to the Israelis that this situation has to change and that Israel’s settlement policy must finally come to an end. Norbert Neuser,  
rapporteur.

 Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, the beginning of 2012 is a timely occasion for the report on universal energy access, as the United Nations General Assembly has designated 2012 as the International Year of Sustainable Energy for All. To me and to all my fellow Members who worked with me on this report in committee, two facts are particularly important. The first is that we want renewable energy. The second is that we want everyone to have access to these new sources of energy. Consequently, these sources of energy must be affordable by everyone. In the Committee on Development, we worked together very constructively, including with NGOs. In this connection, particular mention must be made of the London-based organisation, Practical Action, and of Sweden’s Stockholm Environment Institute. Our secretariat also provided us with vigorous support in finding ways in which we can forge ahead with universal access to renewable energy. Allow me to clarify once more what we are talking about here. At present, 1.3 billion people live without electricity. A total of 2.7 billion people use biomass to cook, on improvised stoves. The vast majority of these live in rural areas, mainly in sub-Saharan Africa and India. To give just one example: 20% of the population of Kenya has access to the grid, but only 5% of the rural population. Access to energy brings not only light and power, but also – and above all – cooking facilities and heating. Yet access to energy is still not a Millennium Development Goal. Without access to it, however, it will be difficult to achieve our Millennium Development Goals. That is why we call in the report for renewable energy to be included in the post-2015 MDGs. It is hard to see how schools, training facilities, health centres and hospitals could exist or function without electricity. Cooking and heating with biomass causes millions of deaths each year in shacks, as a result of harmful smoke. Many of Africa’s governments have therefore banned the use of coal for cooking and heating, for climate and health reasons. In practice, however, those responsible have to look the other way when coal is produced and sold. We very much welcome the fact that, in its Agenda for Change, the Commission has included energy as a guiding priority. Allow me, therefore, to summarise our key demands in the report once more. We call on the EU and the Member States to support the UN goals of universal access to energy by 2030 and to align their policies accordingly. We call on the Commission to focus on small, local renewable energy projects, because only then will it be possible to reach the majority of the population. More money should be made available for this. The European Investment Bank and the other European development banks are not geared towards small, local energy projects. That has to change; universal energy access should be prominently represented in the Rio+20 process. Finally, universal energy access should be included as a Millennium Development Goal post-2015.

 Madam President, Baroness Ashton, the European Union is involved in a number of missions in Afghanistan on the basis of United Nations resolutions. Too many young soldiers from Europe have lost their lives in Afghanistan. A large number have been seriously injured or are suffering from the mental stress caused by military service. Thousands of civilian aid workers from Europe risk their lives every day to help to bring about a better future in Afghanistan. All of them and all of us have a right to know how Europe’s commitment in Afghanistan can be bought to successful and lasting conclusion and how long we will continue to have a military presence in the country. What needs to be changed or improved and what are the objectives of the new EU strategy for Afghanistan? We need to make greater efforts in the area of civil reconstruction. We must at last make progress with retraining the Afghan police force and judiciary. We know that there will not be a military solution and, therefore, we must increase our efforts to bring about a political solution to the conflict, by means of the EU and a common foreign policy. We must show determination and push forward with the internal reconciliation process in Afghanistan and include moderate members of the Taliban. We need to put in place specific initiatives, in particular at a regional level, to stabilise the situation. This involves, in particular, effective means of combating drug cultivation and trafficking. Our strategy includes good proposals. We call on the Afghan Government to demonstrate that it has the will to introduce a better system of governance which is free from corruption. However, the new EU strategy can only be successful if it no longer plays a passive role, but actively involves the neighbouring countries. Baroness Ashton, we are putting our hopes on you, we are relying on you and you have our full support. Norbert Neuser  (S&amp;D

 Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, the signs look very promising for the EU-Africa summit. The summit will revolve entirely around an equal partnership for a better common future. Two months after the Millennium Development Goals summit in New York, we have the unique opportunity to take further specific, binding steps in the fight against poverty in Africa. We are, of course, following all of China’s extensive activities on the African continent to safeguard its own supply of raw materials with great concern. It is very much reminiscent of the behaviour of colonial states. The European Union must, therefore, press for a regulation that promotes the common good of, and social progress in, the African countries. That will create work that is sustainable. I therefore expressly welcome the Commission’s proposal to employ effective controls in the context of raw materials management. Together with the African partners, we need to support a structural policy that promotes growth and climate protection in order for the African people to escape from the poverty trap. We support the Commission’s proposals for social cohesion, because they will help to create jobs. We must put the people of Africa in a position where they can achieve the goal of earning a living wage through their own work. Finally, I would like to provide a summary of the following priorities. Firstly, we need to strengthen the African Union and its representations in all international bodies – the Security Council, G20 and the Pan-African Parliament. The Millennium Goals must be achieved in Africa by 2015 by means of further initiatives. We must ensure that the social standards stipulated by the International Labour Organisation (ILO) are laid down and made binding in any economic and trade agreements between the EU and Africa. Norbert Neuser  (S&amp;D

 Madam President, Commissioner, I welcome the clear words chosen by Mr Piebalgs. It is important for the European Parliament to show clearly where it stands and also to condemn the brutality that has taken place there. It has taken us a long time to hold the debate on Western Sahara in the European Parliament, and I think that we have been too hesitant in our actions and that we act only after there have been fatalities there. I am pleased that we will be able to adopt a resolution tomorrow with all parties, which will perhaps not go as far as one or other of the groups would like, but it represents a broad consensus and is a clear signal to Morocco and to the population of Western Sahara that the European Parliament stands by its fundamental values. As chair of the Intergroup, I would like to offer my sincere thanks to all of its members, who have ensured that Western Sahara has remained, and will continue to remain, on the agenda. I am certain that, together with Mr Piebalgs and Baroness Ashton, we must remain committed to Western Sahara. Norbert Neuser  (S&amp;D

 Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, achievement of the Millennium Development Goals by 2015 is crucially dependent on how much money the rich industrialised nations make available for combating hunger and poverty, reducing child and maternal mortality and combating malaria and AIDS. Our conclusion is sobering. Our promises will not be met. Prior to the financial crisis, we in Europe, as rich industrialised nations, had promised the poorest countries USD 50 billion for this year, 2010. It will be significantly less than that: around USD 36 billion. Even the agreed twelve-point action plan, according to which the wealthy countries want to give 0.7% of their gross national income in development aid, will not be fulfilled. Some countries are setting a good example, but my country, Germany, does not look good. We ought to follow the example of other countries like Sweden, Luxembourg, Belgium, Ireland, the United Kingdom and even Spain. Peter Simon,  
deputising for the rapporteur Mojca Kleva Kekuš

 Mr[nbsp ]President, our colleague, Mojca Kleva Kekuš, who is the co-rapporteur on this file, became a mother two months ago so she cannot be here with us today. I wish her and her little daughter all the best. She did a lot of good work on this dossier, so allow me now to present her words and ideas. A year ago, with the change in international standards, Parliament received a package of Commission proposals for updating and improving European legislation on combating money laundering more effectively. At a time when technology and the means available to criminals are constantly evolving, it is crucial that our legislation should keep pace with the changing realities. We now have before us an updated regulation, which will enhance the transparency of fund transfers of all types: domestic and cross-border. The regulation lays down rules for our banks and other payment-service providers regarding information on payers and payees which they need to collect and transfer throughout the entire payment chain. This update will make it easier for law enforcement authorities to track funds transferred by criminals and terrorists. The new rules will help to identify not only the payers but also the receivers of laundered money. The new regulation focuses more closely on the effectiveness of regimes to counter money laundering and terrorist financing, and on ensuring greater clarity and consistency of rules across the Member States. It is also broader in scope, with a view to addressing new threats. The rapporteur, Ms[nbsp ]Kleva Kekuš, is also pleased that, thanks to Parliament’s involvement, the regulation is now more effective in ensuring compliance with European data-protection requirements, guaranteeing that all the safeguards protecting individual rights in relation to personal data will actually be applied. What remains crucial in making the fight against money laundering effective, however, is the work on enforcement and implementation of the new rules. To combat this problem effectively we need two things at the same time: a coordinated response from law enforcement bodies in the Member States and a standard procedure for financial institutions and payment-service providers. The new rules now centre on a risk-based approach, which should strengthen the capabilities and roles of payment-service providers in identifying transfers that smell fishy. To conclude, the danger of money laundering is also closely linked with the problems of tax evasion and tax havens. This Parliament has, on numerous occasions, called for concrete and effective action to eliminate the scandalous tax gap. The improvement of these rules on fund transfers will serve as one small piece of the puzzle. The rapporteur, Ms[nbsp ]Kleva Kekuš, believes that, thanks to good cooperation and hard work on the part of the other co-rapporteur and all the shadows, the text in front of us is something that Parliament can be proud of. She thanks everyone for their contribution. Peter Simon  (S&amp;D

Mr President, Mr Louca, you have emphasised the importance of this House in relation to the continued development of economic and monetary union. I therefore allow myself to refer to paragraph 8 of the report that we are adopting today. With this paragraph this House calls on the Council to finally bring to a conclusion the legislative procedures relating to the realisation of economic and monetary union that are being blocked by the Council. Nine months ago this House adopted a key part of the banking union legislation, that relating to deposit guarantees, at first reading. Since then it has been up to the Council to respond and find a common position. For nine months the Council has been sleeping on this. For nine months the Council has been inactive, and you, Mr Louca, as the President-in-Office of the Council, have taken no action – absolutely no action at all – in relation to the European Parliament in four and a half months to move this legislative procedure forward! We have promised European taxpayers that future crises will not be paid for by them, but by the banks themselves. If we now endeavour to implement supervision quickly, we will be making use of the European Stability Mechanism. Also taxpayers’ money! A reliable deposit guarantee scheme, a reliable fund for the recovery and resolution of banks – these are funds that relieve the burden on taxpayers. Devote yourself to these funds with the same zeal! Make exactly the same progress with them! You will be judged on this by European taxpayers, but also by this House. Peter Simon  (S&amp;D
). 
 – (DE) 
Mr President, Commissioner, I extend warm thanks for your cooperation on one of the important elements in the banking union project, deposit guarantee schemes. You have quite rightly pointed out that the four pillars alongside supervision are of equal importance. Deposit guarantee schemes and crisis funds are two of these four pillars. This morning, Commission President Barroso stated that we could not have a situation where, in future, citizens would still have to pick up the tab for the mistakes of the banks. As you know, you have significant support in this House for the best possible financing of deposit guarantee schemes and crisis management. However, you know as well as I do that our common opponent is sitting in the Council. You know as well as I do that the deposit guarantee scheme that we adopted with a large, cross-party majority seven months ago with a worthwhile level of funding that would bring stability to the area has been given the green light by this House and sent forward for implementation. For the last seven months, the governments of the Member States have done nothing to meet us half way, nothing to ensure the future stability of the systems. I would like to ask at this juncture how you think we can rescue this situation. One thing is clear: Parliament will not allow plans to be drawn up for chronically underfunded guarantee schemes that are not worthy of the name. How can we work together to persuade the Council to keep its promises, so that our citizens are no longer asked to provide backing for banks that should be wound up or to pay out on deposits, but that the banks themselves should provide their own protections in future by contributing to corresponding funds? Peter Simon,  
rapporteur.
 – (DE)
 Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, tomorrow we are to vote on the new regulation on the deposit guarantee scheme at first reading. This is remarkable on several counts. Firstly, on a procedural level, because, as part of the new regulation of the financial markets, we have thus far managed to reach an agreement between the Council and Parliament at first reading, where both sides at least had a solution that they agreed they could live with. That is not the case here. Agreement between the Council and Parliament has proved impossible. The other remarkable thing is that this proved impossible at a point where the new financial market regulations are most tangible to the people of Europe, because it is their fate at stake, their savings books and their current accounts – in other words, their money. The European Commission made a proposal that initially seemed a little too inflexible in Parliament’s view when it came to the way in which guarantee schemes were to be organised. As rapporteur, I am very pleased that, thanks to the excellent support, cooperation and constant dialogue with the shadow rapporteurs, I have finally succeeded in producing a draft that takes account of this. This means that in future, the principles promised by politicians in all Member States to their people will be embraced in Europe and that, in the event of future bank crises and bank failures, the taxpayer will not be required to pick up the tab, but rather the banks will have saved the necessary resources in a fund during the good times, or at least the less bad times, to enable them to pay depositors, current account holders and savers in the event of a crisis involving the collapse of a bank. In addition to suggesting such a stable fund, we also came up with a solution for the periods within which ordinary citizens should get their money back. I think that the period of one week that we suggest is within a timeframe where people will still manage to get by and will be able to go about their daily business without needing additional cash. We did not think that longer periods without access to finances would be reasonable. We continue to believe that we need to ensure that the different risk profiles of the banks in Europe should be taken into account when payments are made into a guarantee fund. Riskier banks should be required to pay in more than banks that have a lower risk because of their business models. All of these principles were brought together into an overall draft here in Parliament, finding broad majority support in the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs, in a broad coalition of parties, from the Left, through the Socialists, the Greens and the Liberals to the Conservatives. When we came to negotiate with the Member States, this made it all the more difficult for us to understand why they were unwilling to provide the necessary resources for a guarantee fund, to be provided by the banks in order to establish sufficient stability, why it proved impossible to achieve a faster payout for depositors, and why a consumer-friendly solution could not be found, even after eight months of negotiations. We therefore agreed, by means of a first reading, to give a clear signal in favour of consumer protection in Europe. We are prepared to go to a swift second reading with the Council. We wish to thank the Commission for its efforts in brokering a deal. However, we believe that tomorrow, we will have to show the European public what we think is appropriate in relation to depositor protection in Europe. Peter Simon,  
rapporteur.

 Mr President, Commissioner, I can only return these expressions of thanks in equal measure. Like you, I am convinced that there is a positive prospect of success in the coming weeks and months under the Danish Presidency, provided all those involved, by which I mean quite explicitly the Council, enter into constructive negotiations. Constructive negotiations also mean being willing actually to provide certain minimum standards in these guarantee schemes, as emphasised verbally on frequent occasions to the public. Then I believe that we will have no problem and that we will start to see light at the end of the tunnel. I would like to thank the rapporteurs and the shadow rapporteurs for their kind words and for their support to date. I believe that we will also be able to continue working together in this positive vein in the coming months and would like to add my voice to that of Mr Barnier in relation to what we have heard from Ms Ford and Ms Swinburne. I think I could not have put it better myself at this point. I would therefore like to limit my answer to a single point, namely, to the comment made by Mr Stoyanov in relation to the question of a four week payout period versus a seven day payout period. None of us want to make promises that we cannot keep. We therefore need to make it clear that the schemes can pay out within the promised deadlines. National legislation requires British banks to take all the necessary steps to facilitate this. They have already been able to do that. If British banks can do this in seven days, then I believe banks in your country, and mine too, will be able to do the same. We will allow them sufficient time to be able to make money available as quickly as possible in the interests of the public. I believe that this is a point that we will need to discuss further in our forthcoming negotiations with the Council. I would again like to thank all my colleagues and hope that we shall produce a result under the Danish Presidency. Peter Simon,  
rapporteur.

 Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, public services are a fundamental pillar of our European social model and not only play a key role for the individual citizen, but are also of enormous importance for the wellbeing of society at large. For this reason, the following question should be uppermost in our minds when we come to reform the EU State aid rules on services of general economic interest. What conditions are needed to ensure the highest possible service quality and, on the other hand, to guarantee universal access for all levels within the population? The key to the provision and organisation of such high-quality public services is certainty among service providers and public authorities in relation to the general legal conditions, on the one hand, and greater proportionality in the regulations, on the other, so that more attention is paid to the diversity of the various kinds of public service and so that administrative effort is reduced. Thus, the EU State aid rules can only be reformed if the special function of public services is taken into account and if the subsidiarity principle is strictly observed. In addition, a legal framework for public services should be established for a sufficient degree of legal certainty. For us in the Group of the Progressive Alliance of Socialists and Democrats in the European Parliament, the legal basis for this would be Article 14 of the Treaty of Lisbon. However, as we know, opinion in the European Parliament has been divided on this issue for many years. Nonetheless, we believe that this report has succeeded in its objective of finding a compromise that could be accepted by almost all sides. The administrative effort involved in managing compensatory payments to those providing public services is currently too high. This is particularly true for small authorities and service providers. The increase we have called for in the thresholds for exemption from mandatory notification of the European Commission when claiming compensatory payments would provide initial relief. The State aid rules must be designed so that the administrative effort expended by the local authorities and service providers is proportionate to the potential impact on the internal European market and on competition. The special de minimis
 arrangements we propose provide an important basis for this, involving a general exception to the regulations for purely local services and social services. To ensure that we cater more precisely to the special role of social services, we would call for a clear definition and protection of their function and character. In addition, our report also clearly rejects the proposal from the European Commission that efficiency criteria should be introduced for services of general interest as a prerequisite for establishing their compatibility with EU competition rules. The European Commission is going beyond its remit here, as it is simply responsible for controlling State aid. On the other hand, the definition of economic conditions is solely a matter for the Member States and can only be regulated on a European level with the cooperation of the European Parliament. In this context, I would like to close by thanking my colleagues, the shadow rapporteurs, for excellent cross-party cooperation in the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs. The clear vote in favour of my report at committee level is evidence of this results-based, solutions-oriented cooperation. I am therefore confident that in tomorrow’s plenary vote, we shall also succeed in sending out a clear signal from the European Parliament to the European Commission demanding sustainable, future-proofed general conditions in the area of public services. Peter Simon  (S&amp;D

 Madam President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, right across Europe, our cities and communities have to struggle with problem districts. Right across Europe, we try to solve this problem by bringing these disadvantaged areas and the people living in them up to the level of normal life in the rest of our towns and cities. If, however, we now lay down criteria in the field of social housing, as the Commission is doing here, if we lay down criteria that explicitly – as some Members have already said – preclude a mixing of the population in these areas, that will undermine all the efforts made by the competent parties on the ground for decades. It will also undermine ventures that the European Union has promoted with its Community initiatives Urban and Urban II. If, here, we restrict the criteria according to which social housing can be subsidised in such a way that actually only the poorest of the poor, the most disadvantaged of the disadvantaged, receive a subsidy and can be helped within the framework of social housing, we will actually be putting up obstacles to this segment of the population mixing in disadvantaged districts, something that is, in fact, urgently needed. This will lead to more social exclusion of precisely these population groups and will only increase these problems in our cities. With that in mind, a broad definition and broad interpretation of the principle of subsidiarity are the order of the day, and I would be grateful to the Commission if it could briefly express a position in this regard. Petra Kammerevert,  
on behalf of the S&amp;D Group.

 Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, I, too, would like to offer my sincere thanks to Ms Geringer de Oedenberg for the results of her negotiations with the Council. I know that it was difficult to also get the numerous good ideas that we had in Parliament through the tough negotiations with the Council. Certainly, with the directive, we have now found a viable route to granting works of literature orphan work status and preserving this cultural heritage for the future while making it accessible. However, I do still have some minor doubts about whether we have really found an efficient solution for audiovisual works. Across the EU, a cultural asset has accumulated in the archives, especially of broadcasters after 1945, that is of inestimable value. Preserving this cultural heritage for the future, too, poses an enormous challenge on both a technical and financial level. The number of rights holders for audiovisual works is frequently higher than for written works. The diligent search that, under the directive, will also be necessary for audiovisual works takes a form that is therefore intensive in terms of costs, time and personnel. There is a great cultural policy interest in preserving our audiovisual heritage, especially in this Internet age. We now need to carefully observe whether we have succeeded, through this directive, in noticeably reducing the number of audiovisual works in the European Union that are unusable in practical situations due to the rights being unclear. The review clause offers us a good opportunity here. In any case, we need to prevent audiovisual material in the archives going to waste as unrecoverable because it proves too costly to clear up who holds the rights. It goes without saying that, for orphan works, too, rights holders must be given reasonable remuneration. The involvement of collecting societies and other rights declaration systems here could help to remove uncertainties about rights, allow originators to come into their own, and thus also to release cultural treasures. I would have liked to have seen a little greater progress at this juncture, but the first step has been taken, and I believe we will work on this further over the forthcoming years. Petra Kammerevert  (S&amp;D

 Mr President, we must get rid of ACTA and I am pleased that the debate here in Parliament is moving in precisely this direction. ACTA is an attack on fundamental rights, such as the protection of privacy, freedom of information and communication and the right to informational self-determination. It is the whole host of vague legal terms which have opened the door to this. We are faced with the threat that legal protection and legal procedures will no longer be available. We are right to be concerned that providers will be forced to monitor the Internet, put web blocks in place and filter content. Ultimately, this could lead to law enforcement being privatised and the providers being turned into deputy sheriffs. The protection of individuals’ copyright must not, under any circumstances, lead to the freedom of information and communication being undermined. It is true that we need a modern copyright law which has a sensible balance between the interests of the originators and of the users. I would like the Commission finally to submit a proposal for this. ACTA will not help in this respect at all. Instead, it is forcing us to move in a very specific direction. This is why we must say ‘No’ to ACTA tomorrow. Petra Kammerevert  (S&amp;D

Madam President, I would like to bring a little reality to the illusion that has just been so elegantly produced because, from a culture and media policy point of view, the Council’s Common Position is, in fact, a disappointment and unsatisfactory. Frequencies are a scarce public good with considerable cultural and media policy significance. As long as, for example, radio needs frequencies to broadcast its services, these are of particular importance for the freedom of the media and of expression in Europe. The Committee on Culture and Education has put forward a series of proposals for how this can reasonably be taken into consideration. Alongside clear wordings on the special role of radio and the consideration that it needs to be given, we warned that we need to open the door now to the second digital dividend. We called for clear compensation rules so that it is clarified that switchover-related costs, for example for the new procurement of technology in theatres, will be assumed and that provision must be made for compensation for investments that made the digital dividend possible. There is nothing left of all this, apart from the brief reference to the Telecoms Package and a few permissive provisions for the Member States. I now expect the Commission and the Member States to at least demonstrate in their practical actions that they are aware of their responsibilities, that their dealings with this public good will not be solely in pursuit of economic benefit and that they are aware of its importance for media diversity and for the cultural interests of our society. Petra Kammerevert  (S&amp;D
). 
 – (DE)
 Mr President, an open Internet and the guarantee of non-discriminatory access for everyone are essential prerequisites for the freedom of communication, the freedom of information, media pluralism and diversity of opinion. We are therefore sending an important and appropriate signal to the Commission and also to the Member States that we want the ‘best effort’ principle as well as fundamental transparency regulations to be laid down. However, I would have liked us to call on the Commission today to clearly define net neutrality and to enshrine it in law. If we wait any longer, we run the risk that network operators will create a version of reality that will be very difficult to put right later on. I would also have liked to have seen a very clear ban on the control of the content of data packets. I would have liked the back door that this resolution leaves open to be closed today, and from the discussion, I sense that many fellow Members agree with me here. I believe that we should continue to work on this. Petra Kammerevert,  
rapporteur for the opinion of the Committee on Culture and Education

 Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, sexual abuse and sexual violence against children and young people as well as images of this are indeed among the worst possible crimes that anyone could commit against young people. Our highest priority must be to protect the victims, to prosecute the perpetrators and to punish them in a procedure that follows the rule of law. It is therefore good that, together, we have found a way to tackle this crime throughout the EU and to obtain a common basis for this. In the Committee on Culture and Education, in addition to the issues of prevention, effective prosecution, information and more instruction in the use of media, one principle was particularly important to us and that was the principle of ‘deletion rather than blocking’. I am therefore pleased that, after a long struggle, we have succeeded in stipulating the deletion of websites depicting sexual violence against children and young people. The Commission proposed making it mandatory for all Member State to block these websites. However, it is no help to any child at all simply to draw a curtain, so to speak. Internet blocks are ineffective, imprecise, easy to circumvent and do not help to combat sexual abuse. In contrast, they create a censorship infrastructure, an instrument for controlling communication streams and are thus a threat to fundamental rights. In Germany, this has now been implemented. I very much hope that this example will also be followed in other Member States and that they will not use the option of blocking, as stated in the directive. Petra Kammerevert,  
rapporteur for the opinion of the Committee on Culture and Education.

 Madam President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, political initiatives for developing fast Internet connections across the board are, in principle, to be welcomed. However, the spectrum is a scarce resource and, above all, it is a public good. It was therefore a particular concern of the Committee on Culture and Education that it be made clear that the spectrum is, and remains, essential for the fulfilment of a wide range of societal, cultural and social functions. For this reason, it was particularly important to us that the requirements of the telecoms package for safeguarding media pluralism and cultural diversity were not thrown out by the back door. Both public and private broadcasting are essential guarantors of media pluralism and diversity of opinion in Europe. We must ensure that they can continue to fulfil their vital functions unimpeded in future, too. The Committee on Culture and Education had therefore proposed that the 790 band not be opened in the first instance, but unfortunately, the Committee on Industry, Research and Energy did not follow our suggestion. Although it is mentioned in several places that the interests of broadcasting are to be taken into consideration, the Committee on Culture and Education would have liked there to have been much clearer wording in this regard. It was particularly important to us that, before spectrum allocation, clear regulations be laid down to prevent theatres and anyone using wireless microphones, for example, from being saddled with the cost of paying for a frequency change or for new technology. We are all called on to continue to ensure a fair balance of interests for all parties concerned. I hope that we will succeed in doing so in future, too. Petra Kammerevert  (S&amp;D

 Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, first of all, I would once again like to offer my sincere thanks to Mrs Trüpel for the truly excellent report that we are debating today. I believe that it is a splendid project that will be making Europe’s diverse cultural heritage available to the people of Europe and throughout the world in a digital online library. However, it still requires further joint efforts on our part to actually make this project a success. A significant prerequisite for this is, in the view of my group, the free – and that means also, as far as possible, cost-free – access to our cultural heritage via Europeana. In the joint discussions, we have reached a good compromise, which protects the interests of authors of protected works on the one hand while, at the same time, providing the necessary free accessibility, and I would very much like the Commission to also take account of and adopt these proposals in future. Another prerequisite is that the Member States become increasingly aware of their responsibility. For my own country, this means that it is not acceptable for Goethe to be available in Polish and French, but not in the original German. In this regard, we must all jointly call on the Member States more strongly to once again provide the appropriate financial resources to make Europeana a real success on this level as well. Udo Bullmann  (S&amp;D

Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, with or without a summit, Europe is still in recession. There is a lack of growth stimulus and a shortage of jobs. Mr Barroso and Mr Van Rompuy, you will have to launch some fresh initiatives before your term in office comes to end, otherwise there will be no end to this crisis in Europe. A summit, no matter how intensive the debate, cannot change anything. Europe’s young people have no jobs.  Mr Barroso, you have instruments at your disposal. Mr Andor and the Commission could utilise the available instruments. Why are we not making cuts within the framework that we already have, within the framework of the commitments made in the European Semester, tying the Member States into this process and starting straight away? Why are we not focusing on the young unemployed based on a specific annual percentage proposed by the Commission? Why can we do all kinds of things on a binding basis but we apparently cannot combat youth unemployment this way? The European Parliament is waiting for you to take the initiative.  We need more economic policy competences at the European level, that is absolutely right. The basic question is this: who is doing the regulating here, and what are they regulating? Every time the German Finance Minister, Mr Schäuble, comes and talks to us, he says that he would like to have a strong Finance Commissioner. We say, fine, let us give the job to Mr Rehn. That is the Mr Rehn who is possibly listening now to what this House has to say. Mr Rehn, it would be wonderful if you were given more competencies. However, let us make a deal, and let us be quite clear about it: you would then negotiate your mandate with the European Parliament. Life would be very different then. You would not have to ring round all of the European capitals to find out what they wanted at that particular moment. You would not have to negotiate any bilateral agreements with people who have no idea what it is all about. No, you hammer out your mandate with this House. Europe has all the means at its disposal and all the techniques it needs. We should be strengthening the European Union in its present form. We do not need another Europe. We do not need any new institutions. We need to strengthen the existing institutions, and that means strengthening the European Parliament. That is the only way to move out of the crisis. Udo Bullmann  (S&amp;D
). 
 – (DE)
 Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, indeed, the summit has turned around the debate. However, Mr Van Rompuy, the Member States have not yet dared to make the leap. Indeed, it is a major breakthrough to say that we want to make the European Stability Mechanism more active. That is only right and proper. If we do not, we will not really be able to halt the crisis. However, it is also entirely clear to me why the first Member States are already backing off again, why the first heroes of their troops are already disappearing back into the bushes. Why? It is because they forgot to clarify how the stability mechanism would be financed so as to be able to afford this. That takes us to the problem at the heart of this debate. Europe faces a challenge. We will only overcome the crisis if we are able to make a great qualitative leap: more Europe, better ways of working and more joint action. However, we cannot make a run-up to this great leap while at the same time slamming on the brakes. That is what is constantly demonstrated by Member States. I can also say, as regards the second topic, that it is right to say that we want to create a programme for growth. The growth programme is essential. You have opportunities to do so, Mr Van Rompuy, as does Mr Barroso. Simply show us the figures, however, for how much this growth programme can generate. Will it be 0.1%, 0.2%, 0.6% of gross national income? What will it cost to implement the rules of the fiscal pact, which are still too rigid? Perhaps 1%, 1.5%? What is the bill? We need to do more in this direction if it is to work. Udo Bullmann  (S&amp;D
). 
 – (DE)
 Mr President, I have one question for the Council and the Commission. I would like to say to the representatives of the Council Presidency: you know very well that the level of public investment in countries like Germany is currently zero. The situation is not much better elsewhere. This means that public property in Europe is falling into disrepair. Wherever the troika is not forcing states to sell this property below its real value, it is becoming dilapidated. What is your response to this? I have not heard you say anything. In the past, Mr Monti’s name was on everyone’s lips and he was frequently quoted when he talked about the internal market. Today, Mr Monti is saying how important it is for us to invest in our national economies and none of you have mentioned his name. Neither the Council nor the Commission have made any comment on his proposals. I would very much like to know why. I believe that there is a reason why we are not making progress. Your explanations that, on the one hand, we need to save and, on the other, that we must stimulate growth are all correct. Unfortunately, however, they do not explain why something is happening. Instead, they explain why nothing is happening. There is a reason why this is the case, which is that the people who have the upper hand in the Commission and in the Council believe that the best way of climbing a mountain is to put on the brakes on the way up. This runs counter to the laws of physics, just as your economic proposals run counter to the laws of mathematics. I expect you to make changes, because if you do not take up a clear position, you will not help Europe to make progress. Udo Bullmann  (S&amp;D
). 
 – (DE)
 Mr President, Commissioners, ladies and gentlemen, sometimes, I ask myself what you actually take away from these debates with us after sitting here so patiently. Mr Barroso has gone, so it is too late to ask him. The Council is not here either, so the question is superfluous. However, as you are responsible for various areas of the Commission, I can ask you: what will you actually take away from this debate with the European Parliament on an unbelievably serious issue – one that will decide the fate of our populations in the Member States? I will tell you what I am taking away from it: I have a problem. Whenever your services give you reports of how we are not making any progress because growth continues to be in decline, of how employment is in the doldrums, then you get someone to write something about employment and how it can be increased through relatively non-binding measures. I have read it all a hundred times before. Over the past twelve years, I must have read what is written here a hundred times. However, those who commit this stuff to paper are sitting in your departments, Commissioner Rehn. What they actually believe is something different. They believe that we need to chase the countries of southern Europe through a structural recession. Those are the hard facts of the Stability and Growth Pact, those are the hard facts of the fiscal pact, and those are the hard facts of the erroneous expenditure policy. Until you resolve this contradiction and actually commit to paper some concrete measures for raising levels of investment again, the people will not understand you. I do not understand you either. (The speaker agreed to take a blue-card question under Rule 149(8)) Udo Bullmann  (S&amp;D

Blue-card answer.
 – (DE)
 Mr President, firstly, I would like to say to the questioner that the countries she mentions only have no problems on the surface. If you actually read the data on the Netherlands, you will see that growth is in decline there too. When Germans read the statistics, they actually know very well that they are very dependent on them. Things may appear to be going better again in the south, but this is only fleeting. On no account should we think that Germany can maintain its export rates in the long term without a functioning euro area. So my answer is yes; we need to arrive at a constellation in which demand in southern Europe is also boosted again. We need to create new jobs and sensible investment projects, and we need to use all the means at our disposal to ensure that we are not organising a recession that lasts 10 or 20 years. Udo Bullmann  (S&amp;D
). 
 – (DE)
 Mr President, the Council Presidency has told us that on 15 May, it will work towards a European mandate allowing the Commission to negotiate. I think that is a good thing. Rightly so. We will then be able to see how far the European Commission gets in its negotiations with Switzerland and others. It is also right, however, when honourable Members say that we should go for enhanced cooperation in areas where they can help us further. Yet you should ask sometime – you do, after all, have an audience for what you are doing – you should ask the German Government and the French Government why they have not been doing that for a long time already. Why is it that in their home countries, they always come out with fine words, but never actually take the initiative. That would be something. Please would you also publicly answer the question as to why the US is apparently far more successful in its bilateral efforts and is able to exert pressure far more successfully – on Switzerland, for example – than the German Government, rather than simply saying that what they are doing is fine. In the interests of our citizens, ask what the US is doing differently to European countries, so that we can make some practical progress at last. Udo Bullmann  (S&amp;D

 Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, this is the reality of economic development. The Italian economy began to grow at the beginning of the year and in Spain, the signs of growth are even clearer. The situation in Portugal is no better. There are even problems in the Netherlands and industrial order books are shrinking in Germany. Mr Barroso said before he left that we had had a useful discussion this morning. I am currently trying to work out what he meant by that. Mr Barroso and Mr Van Rompuy said ‘growth and employment’ around 10 to 15 times this morning, it is true. Has that changed anything or will it change anything? No! Repeating empty phrases will not result in any changes taking place. Therefore, I would like to know what is new about the way in which the European Council, the Member States and the Commission are dealing with the problem. Mr Barroso gave us one hint when he said that structural reforms must also involve social cohesion. It would be good if you could explain what you mean by that, because we have been arguing about it for quite some time. What do you mean by this? Do you agree with the idea proposed by Mr Swoboda and the Group of the Progressive Alliance of Socialists and Democrats in the European Parliament that all young people must have prospects for the future, but it is just a question of how we ensure this is the case? Do you want minimum wages in all European Member States which adapt dynamically to productivity and growth? Is that what you want? Then you say that growth is essential. Until now, your services have always denied that this had anything to do with investment, because you said that this only concerned structural reforms. This is why the memorandum of understanding in each individual case relating to this issue is so modest. Where is the investment channel that we argued about during the discussions on the ‘six-pack’? If you have nothing to say about investments, then you also have nothing to say about growth. The time for empty phrases has passed. We are waiting for an answer. (Applause) Udo Bullmann  (S&amp;D

 The Members of the European Parliament who belong to the Social Democratic Party of Germany (SPD) would very much have welcomed the introduction by the EU of compulsory contracts at the level of the Member States. However, the Council and the Commission were categorically opposed to this proposal. Nevertheless, the compromise that has been reached allows milk producers throughout Europe to join together in producer organisations. It is of crucial importance for us to ensure that milk producers are put in a stronger position in their negotiations with dairies and retailers. Alongside compulsory contracts, we also strongly supported larger size limits for associations of producer organisations, because that would have further improved the negotiating position of milk producers in Europe. It became clear in this part of the trialogue negotiations that the Council would not have been prepared to accept this, even in the course of a further reading. The opportunity to join together in producer organisations is not a new one for German milk producers because this option is already open to them at a national level as a result of the German Market Structure Act. Given that it was not possible to achieve a better result in the face of opposition from the Council and the Commission, it was all the more important for us to ensure that the interests of small and medium-sized milk producers are taken into consideration in the forthcoming reform of the common agricultural policy (CAP). Conditions must be laid down in the CAP which enable these businesses to continue producing milk even in less favourable regions. This is the only way that we can meet our main requirement, which is to guarantee the existence of a sustainable and multifunctional agricultural industry throughout the whole of Europe.

 Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, let us take a quick look at the harsh economic reality. On the day of the summit, the markets rated Portuguese debt securities for 10-year bonds at 17% interest and for five-year bonds at 20% interest. So much for the question as to the extent to which the summit has helped to calm the economic situation, or the question of to what degree the new intergovernmental treaty has pacified activity on the market. If anyone asks himself where the disquiet is coming from, then perhaps the answer is from the economic data and from the feeling that what we have done is not enough. President Schulz, I would like to thank you expressly for the courage and clarity with which you participated in this summit on behalf of this House in order to say that we will indeed defend the Community method and we certainly want consolidation, but we also need to invest so that Europe’s economies can flourish. I believe that this is a line that this House will be able to agree on, and we will be able to continue to develop a common economic policy. Udo Bullmann  (S&amp;D

Madam President, as the coordinator for the Group of the Progressive Alliance of Socialists and Democrats in the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs, I can confirm that Mr Schwab has tabled an excellent proposal that can be supported by all sides of the House, and would encourage others to follow our lead in supporting it. Udo Bullmann  (S&amp;D

 Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, what does the result of the summit bring us? With regard to the automatic sanctions, I would simply like you to explain, gentlemen, what happens when a country has more than 3% debt in future and you want to apply automatic sanctions, but the country says that Article 126 and the current Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union apply. What will happen then? Then our finest hour, which Mr Lambsdorff has spoken about, will turn out not to have been so fine after all. It is a fake which is not worth the paper it is written on, because it does not change the real situation. In legal terms, what have you actually done? As far as the economy goes, research institutes are saying that in the next two years, perhaps four of the 17 euro area countries will be in a position to achieve the structural deficit target that you have imposed. Possibly by 2015, but only if we can avoid a recession. However, if we take your route, without a growth initiative, we will find ourselves in the midst of a recession. It is a mistake to believe that we can achieve these targets without additional programmes for growth. How will we do it? What have you decided? Without the European Parliament, you will not be able to get out of the mess that you have got yourselves into. Take the opportunity to sit down at the table with the European Parliament and then you will still have a chance. Otherwise, you will find that there are no cards left on the table. (Applause) Udo Bullmann  (S&amp;D

 Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, we all trust that Mr Daul is right when he says that we are hopefully beginning to see the light at the end of the tunnel in this crisis. The litmus test for this question, however, is not to be found in today’s newspaper headlines, but rather in the economic developments of the coming weeks and months. Paragraph 3 of the resolution states: ‘The European Union must improve its prospects for growth and employment.’ This is absolutely correct. A question last night’s document did not answer, however, is the issue of what is to be done in order to improve the prospects for growth and employment. Much later, in paragraph 25, there is an indication of the intent to work out an appropriate strategy. I hope that this will happen. One thing is clear, however, President of the Commission and President-in-Office of the Council: a strategy of cuts without investment will not see us through this crisis. We are already in a state of stagnation and the threat of recession is not far away. Mr Barroso, this will come at a high cost for the people you have referred to, who are at the receiving end of this series of bad decisions, and who will find themselves with no jobs and no income. That is the reason for my question today: When, Mr Van Rompuy, do you intend coming to this House with these proposals so that they can be approved by Parliament? After all, you said yourself that it is a matter for this House to discuss economic policy with you. We must assume responsibility here in a situation where you are obviously ready to curtail the responsibilities of the national parliaments. That is our present task. We would like to hear your answer. Udo Bullmann  (S&amp;D
). 
 – (DE)
 Mr President, President of the Commission, Commissioner, President-in-Office of the Council, there are two questions that remain unanswered in this debate. The first is that, when we read what the World Bank says, when we read what Ms Lagarde at the International Monetary Fund says, it would seem that we are on the brink of a recession. The growth engines have failed. Where are the investments? That is the urgent question for the European Union. I would like to ask you: you refer to the Stability and Growth Pact – where are the investments? You wanted to cut everything do with investments. So, where are the investments? Where can we cooperate so that we can move forward in Europe once again? We Social Democrats are willing to help in finding a strategy that will allow us to move forward. The second question is this: how can we enter into a common bond market? Here, too, you can be sure of our support. Please put forward proposals. Help to convince those in the Council who are still not convinced. We will help you do this, and we would seek the support of the majority in this House. Udo Bullmann  (S&amp;D

 Mr President, I should like to begin my comments with a question to Commissioner Rehn and to Mr Kármán of the Council. Both have spoken of an outstanding matter in the argument between the parliamentary majority and the Council. This week I noted that the Council had opposed text in the report by Mrs Ferreira, the rapporteur for the Group of the Progressive Alliance of Socialists and Democrats in the European Parliament, concerning the symmetrical approach. Are you able to tell me that this problem has been resolved, because the Council voted in favour of the rapporteur? In actual fact, you would then still have a problem between the majority here and the Council – or did you forget to mention that? If so, I should like to know that too, because then I would think that you consider it unimportant. I should like the two of you to explain this to me at the end of this debate. Listening to the two conservative groups in this House, and also to the liberals, I get the impression that if we adopt what they have tabled here then the world will be put to rights. Unfortunately, that is not the case. The world would subsequently be worse, not better – because they have turned an opportunity to create a more common economic policy in Europe into an austerity package. That is a bad thing, because it represents a policy that dates from the last century, because it represents an outdated approach which merely takes sanctions regimes from political techniques and not incentives, or smart taxation, or balanced approaches such as have been represented by us. Various sides of the House have made sufficient pragmatic proposals to allow a balanced package to be tabled. If Mrs Wortmann-Kool wants to claim that it would be blocked by the greens and the social democrats, that is of course simply nonsense. Exactly the opposite is true. To the Members of this House from the Group of the European People’s Party (Christian Democrats) – who run after either the Commission or the Council – I would state that we are not here to let things through on the nod, but rather to think for ourselves. That is what the voters expect of us. I must therefore point out to you that at present you cannot tell whether a Member State is buying defence hardware, fighter aircraft or investing in its education system of tomorrow. You are not in a position to make a qualitative assessment of its budgetary policy. We do, in fact, want to equip you to do so. We wanted a smarter pact which provides greater opportunity for the Commission to have an influence. I cannot understand why Commissioner Rehn is not agreeing to this – more opportunities for influence and a modern economic policy which makes reference to the EU2020 objectives in the interests of our citizens. You have derailed it, and that is a pity. Consequently, this package is by no means balanced. We will continue to fight for a better economic package. We owe this to our electorate. In truth, the answer has to be ‘more Europe’, not ‘less Europe’. It has to be the right Europe, however – not the wrong package. Udo Bullmann  (S&amp;D
). 
 – (DE)
 Mr President, Mr Langen, I just want to make sure that you are familiar with our ideas. I am therefore asking you whether you are aware of what we proposed to your colleague, Mrs Wortmann-Kool, which was firstly that we strengthen the pact by including closer monitoring of selected objectives proposed by Mr Rehn from the EU2020 package, such as research and development and the fight against poverty. This would also include investment in modernising energy supply systems. Udo Bullmann  (S&amp;D
). 
 – (DE) 
Madam President, the Council and Commission are quite right when they suggest that the public budgets in Europe need to be consolidated. However, if we look at how this works and how it will continue to work in the future, then it is evident that the wrong people are being affected. Schools are being closed, teachers are losing their jobs, researchers are finding themselves out on the street and public investments are being cut or left to stagnate. I would like to ask Mr Van Rompuy and Mr Barroso: Is this your intention? Of course you will say that this is not what you want and that other areas are to be cut back. My question then is: Where are the cuts to be made? My key question is as follows: If you believe that the cuts should be made elsewhere, then why is it that the draft that you propose for decision making in the ‘six-pack’ for economic governance makes no distinction as to whether a country purchases tanks or weapons of war or invests in an ailing national economy, or whether it makes an investment in the future? Or perhaps whether it invests in a modern energy supply system and in the education and training of its children? Romano Prodi once famously said that these drafts are stupid. His words are still true because this distinction between good and bad investments cannot be made. Our only choice is to improve these drafts, because Europe cannot be governed sensibly if such distinctions are beyond us. My last question is: Where is the income to be found that will enable us to move forward out of the crisis? After all, we cannot just save our way out of the problem. Mr Barroso, we await your proposal on the financial transaction tax in Europe, something that this House has backed with a large majority. Give Europe a chance and avoid wasting any more time with pious words. Udo Bullmann,  
on behalf of the S&amp;D Group.

 Mr President, I am sorry, Mr Šemeta, but what you are presenting is not enough. It is months since Parliament gave you the job of investigating what action we can take, including in respect of a financial transaction tax; we gave you the job here in this House. You have not done this. What we know of your position – which has been presented in writing by the Commission on more than one occasion – is something different. You want us to tax the small financial service providers: those that still maintain branches, that care about their customers, that care about medium-sized businesses, that ensure business credit is still available. The parties you do not want to tax are the speculators: those who shift millions and billions around the globe with their high frequency trading, thereby ensuring that our economy is unpredictable – unpredictable even to good entrepreneurs and good investors who want to create decent jobs for the future. Your position is therefore unsatisfactory and consequently, this House must find its own voice. I am sorry to say that Mr Gauzès – whom I otherwise hold in very high esteem – is wrong on this occasion. He is wrong because he is watering down the position adopted by this House previously in the Berès report. Anyone who votes in favour of Mr Gauzès’s proposal will be ensuring that the Commission does what it wants to do anyway – namely, proposes no financial transaction tax. That will be the result of agreeing with Mr Gauzès. That is why it would be wrong to agree with him in this instance. Anyone who wants to give this House a voice, who wants to win back trust, who wants to ensure that the citizens of Europe can once again look to our institutions with hope and a belief that we are doing something to deal with the crises must, in this instance, vote in favour of the alternative motion tabled by the Group of the Progressive Alliance of Socialists and Democrats in the European Parliament and must vote in favour of Amendment 2, which has been endorsed by more than 120 Members of this House from all the major groups. Thank you for your support. Udo Bullmann  (S&amp;D

 Mr President, on behalf of my group I would like to table an oral amendment to strengthen equal opportunities and the aspect of gender policy in the Europe 2020 Strategy. I will read the text out in English – new paragraph 10 a:   ‘Insists that gender equality is a key target for achievement of the ambitions of EU 2020. Calls therefore for the full participation of women in the labour market and the full inclusion of female workers in vocational training. Calls also for an agenda to eradicate the pay gap that exists between women and men.’ (Applause) Udo Bullmann,  
on behalf of the S&amp;D Group. 
– (DE)
 Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, Commissioner, President-in-Office of the Council, I have listened closely to what you have said, I have read the Annual Growth Survey, I have read the Ecofin conclusions and now I am absolutely clear about one thing: the European Union is not only experiencing an economic crisis, it is also experiencing a political crisis. What you are recommending to us is nothing new. Ask your staff to show you the documents from the last ten years. The same thing can be seen in all of them, namely that public expenditure is too high, and the only mechanism for adjustment to new times relates to wages and they are always too high. I have not seen any other recommendations. Whether it is raining or snowing, whether we are in a crisis or a boom – it is always the same ideology, but it has nothing whatsoever to do with empirical economic reality. Allow me to suggest something to you: send those people who write these things for you, who carry out the economic analyses in the Council and the Commission, to the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs sometime. We want to get to know your economic models. We want to discuss with them whether they do not see that Europe is on the brink of recession. Remove the German export rates and the German growth rates for example and then you will see what I am talking about. I will then ask you why there is not a single word about investments – when we have lowest level of investment so far, which we ourselves can no longer afford – why there is not a single word about improvements in revenue and nothing about following the cycles or about the fact that we must finally learn to grow together or how we will get out of the crisis. There is nothing about any of these things in your documents. You missed the start of this year, and you will have to make a great effort to meet the expectations of citizens in Europe. However, let me tell you something: if this is the spirit in which you intend to take a decision in March concerning the cconomic governance package and the reform of the Stability and Growth Pact, my group will be unable to be involved in this. Udo Bullmann,  
on behalf of the S&amp;D Group.

Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, why are we here? Mr Barnier said that we are here because the European Parliament has succeeded in establishing European supervisory authorities that are worthy of the name. That was not part of the Council’s programme. It was not part of the Member States’ programme. The Commission, too, had doubts about how long we would actually persevere with regard to the establishment of this new institution. The Council will understand – it will have to understand – and the Commission will, too – possibly even of its own accord – why we are concerned. No, this European Parliament – and this is a statement that I find applies to all party groups, not just to us as Social Democrats – will not allow national games to be played that undermine the powers of these new supervisory authorities. That is why we are interested in the appointment of staff, of course. We have rights in this regard – we have to be consulted. There are one or two things that in fact give us cause for concern. We receive lists of individuals and we receive lists, which when we look at we cannot actually tell whether a gender criterion has been applied. We are given proposals for candidates, which when we consider – and I say this with all due respect to the people concerned – we do not see anyone that we believe could not do a decent job. These are clearly good people who have already shown in their jobs that they can do their work well, but the people that have been presented to us are not people who, on the basis of any authority that they may have demonstrated in their past work, can actually say to the national supervisory authorities where they would stand in the event of a conflict. Where there is European supervision, national momentum comes to a standstill. That surprises and annoys us, and it must call us into action. No, these procedures are unsatisfactory, and I ask myself why, for example, we cannot take the same approach as we are taking with regard to those responsible for OLAF, where you are of course interested in the opinion of this House. Why can we not do that? We still have another opportunity with regard to the executive directors. You can still demonstrate that you are interested in the opinion of the European Parliament. You still have another opportunity. I would urge you both – President-in-Office of the Council and former fellow Member Mrs Győri and Commissioner Barnier, to take this opportunity. You can take on board the objections of this House. You can tell us very clearly how you want to work with us in future. You can tell us very clearly what goals you will support in the 2013 reform and how you will equip the institutions. You will also be able to make it very clear whether you are interested in our opinion in respect of those members of staff that are still to be appointed. I therefore ask you in all earnestness in the interests of Europe to provide these rules quickly. Udo Bullmann  (S&amp;D
).

 Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, in critical situations, Europe has always found a way out of a crisis. Not because different interests have been played off against one another, but because we have combined our interests, which has allowed us to take new paths. I would have liked to ask Mr Barroso a question, but unfortunately he is no longer here. There will, of course, soon be important press conferences on the subject of how we can rescue Europe using the lowest common denominator, but Mr Rehn may be able to pass my question on. I do not understand why we are not taking the following route. Eurobonds are a sensible solution. Mr Schulz has said that on behalf of our group and, in Germany, where this is a critical issue, my party is saying the same thing. The German Government in particular has reservations and there are also reservations in other countries which are paying less interest. Why do we not proceed as follows? We are saying that these problems can be solved. We are now planning to launch eurobonds, but we are putting together a sensible package. What do we need to enable Europe to act? How can we put money into the coffers? How can we create more taxation potential for a sensible, long-term economy? We are launching eurobonds and we are linking this launch with the introduction of the financial transaction tax in the European Union. This package could result in a win-win situation, which would enable everyone to benefit. Ask Mrs Merkel at the European summit if she is prepared to do this. Why is it not possible? Why does the Commission not make a proposal of this kind? It would help everyone and enable a major new project for Europe to emerge from the crisis. I am waiting for the Commission to make this proposal. You must stop trying to talk your way out of it. It is time for you to act in the interest of the citizens of Europe and in the interest of the Member States, so that we can find our way back to a sensible path of growth. Our fate is in your hands, but you must have the courage to take the initiative now. Udo Bullmann,  
on behalf of the S&amp;D Group.

 Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, in her speech this morning, Mrs Harms posed the question of why the spark is no longer being passed from the summits to the people and why new courage and new confidence is not emanating from the summit discussions. As I listened to you this morning and also just now, Mr Barroso, and to Mr Van Rompuy or the Council, too, I got an idea of why the spark is not being passed on. The spark is not even passing into the Chamber here – just look around you. Of course, it is important for more Members to be here. Why are they not here? It is wrong for them not to be here. However, they are not really hearing anything new anyway. You are telling us things that have already been said in the newspapers many times and you are not providing answers to the very pointed questions that have been asked. What is happening with regard to the financial transaction tax? Mr Schulz has asked about this many times. Where is the answer? It is not on the agenda of the G20 summit in Seoul. I would like an explanation. I would also like to know why the European Council, the Belgian Presidency, said that it is in favour of this, but why the European Council at its last three summits merely said that it recommended a feasibility study at global level but not at European level. Why ever not? Does the Council not see the dead end into which you are directing this matter? I will ask you once again, Mr Barroso: when will Mr Šemeta comply with the demand made by this Parliament at the beginning of this year, namely that we want a feasibility study for Europe, too? If you present an opinion on this subject, this Chamber will actually be full and we will listen to you. However, do not avoid the issue any longer. For Europe alone we are talking about EUR 200 billion per year. Ask the Members who belong to the Committee on Budgets what trivial, small amounts they are currently arguing about with the Council. With an initiative we would make progress. We need to breathe life into the roles, then the spark will once again be passed on. That is what we expect from you. Udo Bullmann  (S&amp;D

 Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, as I listen to this debate, I have to admit that it reminds me very much of the debate on the Services Directive. I will tell you why. In that case, too, my fellow Members from the Group of the Greens/European Free Alliance and the Confederal Group of the European United Left – Nordic Green Left declared that there was a regulation on the table in this House that was not perfect, not complete, and yet for years now, they have been grateful for the fact that the Group of the Progressive Alliance of Socialists and Democrats in the European Parliament managed to push it through in this House. That is the truth about this regulation that we will vote on tomorrow. In fact, the improvement made on what the Council and Commission proposed can essentially be attributed to Mr Goebbels and Mrs Regner, who fought for improvements here against the opposition, with the support and excellent cooperation of Mr Gauzès, for which I would like to thank him. In my country, Germany, what we have agreed here for the private equity industry will bring about real improvements for workers and for small and medium-sized enterprises, which no longer need to be afraid of simply being eaten up by the black sheep of the equity industry that do not abide by any standards. These days, when we read and listen to the press telling us that the funds industry is moving its focus away from the Caribbean and towards Europe because it is important to long-term investors that there are good products in which to invest, that supports the work of this Parliament rather than running counter to it. However, before we talk too much about dynamism here, I have to say that my group has been calling for a regulation since 2002. Perhaps there has been evidence of dynamism, but only in the last few weeks. I would like to thank the President-in-Office of the Council and the Commissioner, as you have personally supplied this dynamism. Please tell your colleagues in the Council that, with this method of sluggishness, of ‘yes, but’ and the refusal to put through better regulations in Europe, we will not succeed in getting the next pieces of legislation on derivatives or short selling through. This situation has to change. That is an appeal from this Parliament. Udo Bullmann  (S&amp;D
). 
 – (DE)
 Mr President, Mr Chastel, Commissioner, this could actually have been a time of great answers, but in hindsight, it does not look like it. What is on the table for the so-called reform of the Stability and Growth Pact is no great answer; once again, it is the lowest common denominator – the small morsel that could actually be agreed upon. I congratulate the Commission. You are still at the table – the Member States are not quite going it alone. I also congratulate the Council. Success has been achieved, France and Germany have an agreement – we do not know whether it is a good one or a bad one, but at least they are no longer stuck in the quagmire. What does all this mean? It means that next year, if the growth figures collapse again, we will stand up in front of everyone and have no answer to the economic situation. Where is the section, the legal statute, in which you propose how we can together learn to drag ourselves out of the debt crisis? That is where my group feels there is a gap and that is the debate that we are going to have in this House. Yes, we agree with those Members who want greater commitment to reform. That is something that we want too. However, we then need to discuss the substance. If you are not prepared to provide a more solid foundation for the actual orientation of our budgetary policy, then we can see no reason to continue discussing EU 2020. It is already a paper tiger – we can throw it in the waste paper basket today if you will not debate the substance of it with us more forcefully. We want to make a difference. Yes, it makes a difference whether we invest in limping bureaucracy or in the energy sources and jobs of the future. Where is the point in your proposals where we can make this difference? That is what we are waiting for. This debate has yet to take place. That will be the decisive thing for us. Moreover, we will not accept a catalogue of indicators that is based on the legislation. This Parliament will not have the wool pulled over its eyes. We want to debate whether employment and unemployment are an important feature of budgetary development or not, and we want to do so before the legislation is passed. Udo Bullmann,  
on behalf of the S&amp;D Group.

 Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, let me just point one thing out before I start. The Basel Committee is a group of more or less intelligent central bankers and overseers, but it is certainly no infallible council of wise men and it is definitely not the law. This House is the legislative body – Commissioner, you know that, and we know that you do – and this legislative body will pay close attention to what is put on the table and, where it makes sense, to what is put on the table here, too. Clearly, we do want the rules on capital requirements to be tightened up. How could we not want that, in the wake of the economic crisis in which we still find ourselves? 20 to 30% of the gross national product of our national economies are in pawn as the rescue package for the banks. The people expect us, of course, to make respectable banking rules so that we do not find ourselves in a crisis like this one again. Clearly, we want there to be counter-cyclical elements in this banking safeguard like those, for example, that have already been proving their worth in Spain for years. Although there, too, they had to be implemented in the face of opposition, they are paying off today because they were implemented at an appropriately early point and they did not make the banking system worse; they made it more robust. There are key issues, though, and I am truly grateful to the rapporteur, Mr Karas, for having put these key issues at the heart of his own-initiative report, which we find ourselves absolutely and totally able to support. The first of these is that, yes, indeed, we do need an impact study, specifically a complex impact study that makes it clear what the impact is, for one thing, on the financial sector in all its parts but also, of course, in particular, what the impact is on the real economy. What is the impact on the issue of what the future actually holds for loan financing conditions for small and medium-sized enterprises? The second issue is that we need the certainty that this time, unlike in the past, the agreements will also be implemented in other territories. We need to know that before we legislate, as otherwise there will be a new asymmetry for which we cannot be responsible. The third issue is that there can be no discrimination in terms of legal forms. Those forms among the diversity of the European banking system that particularly proved themselves during the financial crisis – and that means those banks that looked after the small and medium-sized business sector and those banks that were focusing on private customers and thus did not elicit cross-border risks – must not be penalised for the solidarity of their establishment. The proposal on the table at the moment does not do enough to ensure this. We therefore believe that the proposals need to now be improved and that we need to consider how we can tackle this issue in practical terms. Public banking overall is of major value, provided it can be run on a sensible basis. We do also need to ask – and I am thinking here about silent partnership reserves – how this will actually be effected in future, if we buy the regulations as they are envisaged in Basel. This cannot be the last word, nor is it the final version that we will accept. The capital instruments need to be measured in order to see the extent to which they ensure consistent quality without false provisos, are available to absorb losses, are durable and flexible in terms of payment, as the rapporteur also argues in his report. It is a reasonable starting position for us to take. We want the leverage effects to be limited and reasonable allowance to be made for the different risk profiles. We will examine your proposal, therefore, Commissioner, and we hope for the best of cooperation with Parliament. Udo Bullmann,  
on behalf of the S&amp;D Group.

Madam President, Mr Reynders, Commissioner, congratulations on your supervision. Parliament has worked hard on this issue and you have also played your part, which is why the results are so good. We must always look to new tasks and, unfortunately, I must point out that good results are still a long way off in other areas. Let me just say that the regulation of hedge fund managers is still nowhere near a breakthrough. At this point, I would call on both sides, both the Council and the Commission, to get cracking. After all, without your efforts, the regulations will not be of much use. We need equal rights for all. Managers outside the European Union must always be subject to the same conditions as their European counterparts. Otherwise, we are putting Europe at a disadvantage. It is not our aim to put a whole industry behind bars. However, if we do not achieve meaningful improvements that will prevent the black sheep from plundering well-functioning businesses, we are not going to have good regulation. I want to issue this warning: you should not imagine that you will score an easy victory by simply playing the various Members of this House off against each other. If you fail to introduce effective regulation, the whole of Europe will know who it was who went down on bended knee before the lobbyists and that knowledge will give these discussions a different character. A word about the financial transaction tax: My view of this is diametrically opposed to that of the Group of the European People’s Party (Christian Democrats). Europe is waiting for answers. You will have to provide these answers. Do not come back from the G20 summit and tell us: ‘Unfortunately we have achieved nothing, so now there is nothing we can do.’ On the contrary, we need to take action in Europe, which is why we need to plan and implement some decisive measures together with the people in Europe. Remember one thing during your negotiations at the G20 summit: we need a response from you, otherwise there is going to have to be a European response. Udo Bullmann  (S&amp;D

Madam President, as the coordinator for the Group of the Progressive Alliance of Socialists and Democrats in the European Parliament, I would like to make a comment on Amendment 6. I would like to call on my group to vote in favour of Amendment 6, in contrast to what appears on our voting recommendations. This is a mistake in the list. We should vote for Amendment 6 and this is likely to clarify the way in which we will vote now in a decisive situation. Udo Bullmann  (S&amp;D

 Mr President, Mr López Garrido, ladies and gentlemen, I would like to ask you to pass on a message to the other members of the Council. The time for the policy of excuses is over. It is important that you do not decide tomorrow that Parliament should adopt the supervisory package and the hedge funds package more quickly as part of the regulation of the financial markets, while the Council – and I do not mean you personally, Mr López Garrido, but I want to encourage you to help us – simultaneously puts on the brakes and prevents us from finding solutions. The trialogue of the Council, the Commission and Parliament is meeting in this House at the same time to discuss the issue of regulating hedge funds. We have proposed appropriate regulations, which prevent the finance industry from gobbling up industrial firms using speculative funds and bringing the real economy to its knees. However, the Council is blocking these regulations. Please tell the Heads of State or Government that the time for the policy of excuses is long gone. It is no longer acceptable for them to give big speeches at home about the regulations that Europe can introduce and then to chicken out when their officials begin working at a European level. The time for this is past and we can no longer afford to behave in this way in the context of the economic crisis. I would like to ask you the same question, Mr Barroso. It does not matter whether you are mentioning the word ‘growth’ here for the 49th, 52nd or 64th time. It is much more important for you to explain why it is that, as the Economic and Financial Affairs Council (Ecofin) stated the day before yesterday, the Member States of the European Union will have to make huge cuts amounting to 3.5% of their gross national product, but you are not telling us how you will use this money to prevent a dreadful catastrophe on the labour market. In this situation, we must learn to grow together. However, you need to explain how this will happen. Otherwise, the Europe 2020 strategy will not be worth the paper it is written on. We need real answers instead of fictitious answers and excuses in order to ensure that the institutions which you represent are part of the solution and not part of the problem. Udo Bullmann  (S&amp;D

 Mr President, Mr López Garrido, ladies and gentlemen, I have a very specific question which will allow us to emerge from the position of powerlessness and confusion that the crisis has left us in, with no one knowing how the crisis arose and how we can find our way out of it. Mr Schulz has referred to the highly critical speculative products and credit default insurance and to the damaging practice of short selling, which brought Greece to the brink of disaster and could represent a major problem for Portugal and many other countries. Mr López Garrido, you have frequently attended the Economic and Financial Affairs Council (Ecofin) in recent months, why was it not possible for the Member States to take concerted action to ban these products? I have been asking this question in the capital of my own country over recent weeks and months and it has taken you months, in fact until yesterday evening, to introduce a ban on the damaging practice of short selling. I ask myself why we have to wait until things have gone wrong before making use of the appropriate legislative measures, which are already in place, to protect the people and the economies of Europe. I believe it has something to do with the Council’s dreadful, discouraging slowness to act, which you have referred to. I will make a deal with you. We in the European Parliament are presenting concrete proposals. In the context of regulating the supervisory bodies and the discussion about hedge funds, we have proposed that we should take appropriate measures on a European level and we will make the same resolution on derivatives, if you, Mr Langen, do what you are always saying. We are calling on you urgently to ensure that the Council finally begins to work with us to put in place legislation so that we in Europe are able to act and no longer have to wait for ever for the Council to make a move. We need to have the tools at our disposal in Europe to enable us to make progress. Please help to make sure that this happens in the Council. However, the decisive point is that the Council must take action on the legislation. Udo Bullmann  (S&amp;D

 Madam President, Mr Hökmark, I think we have been in different parliaments in recent years, because the parliament I have experienced is different to yours! I have experienced a parliament in which some say we must look more closely into ratings agencies, hedge funds and private equity corporations. We must regulate them, we must carry out checks on the critical players in the financial markets and the critical products to ensure that we are not veering towards an international fiasco. I have also heard others saying ‘hands off’: the market will regulate itself, we do not need all that. Or as Mr McCreevy said – whenever politics interferes, the result is always worse. We have seen the results. The international fiasco is the cause of the overindebtedness of the Member States of the European Union. However, we cannot stand here today and say that it was wrong to focus our growth policy on employment and economic activity. It is irrelevant to the debate, just as it is irrelevant to the debate when Mr Langen says that Chancellor Merkel understood the European Treaty. No, she did not understand it at all. What is worse, she is probably in a position to subordinate the European Treaty and its aims for Europe to her fear of losing an important regional election in North Rhine-Westphalia. These are not the leadership skills that we need in the European Union. We have told the Commission here that EU 2020 is too watered down. There is no meat in it. Please provide some evidence that you are able to acquire new funds. Please fight for a financial transactions tax. Please fight for more economic activity and greater growth prospects in the European Union, to give small and medium-sized enterprises and the workers a chance. Right now, however, we almost sympathise with you for having to save the European Union with governments such as we have at present – governments such as that represented by Chancellor Merkel. Stay strong and create European instruments! That is our main message for the summit, because only then can people hope that we will provide the right answers. Udo Bullmann,

Mr President, Commissioner, I would like to chip in with a few questions on what Mr Scicluna has stated on behalf of the Committee. Commissioner, if there are 70, 80, 90 or 100 times as many financial transactions in the world as gross national product, and if this development is becoming ever more dynamic, would you then say speculative elements are, for the greater part, linked to this explosion of financial products? If so, how do you then plan to curb them, or what might contribute to curbing them? If short-term financial transactions increase more and more relative to gross national product in the world, do you then share our view that we must strengthen the long-term approach in the real economy, where people work, earn money and manufacture products that we can consume and that we can use. If you share this opinion, by what way and means do you believe will we then be able to achieve this? Commissioner, if the tax on financial transactions can make a contribution to this – that is what we want to look into – what would the timeframe be for negotiating this with international partners? We have the impression that the financial instruments that were created in the world are being used right now to speculate against the euro area and against the euro and to act against the weakest Member States. Is it not high time now that we dealt with this and define a European approach? Commissioner, there is one thing I cannot understand, namely why we are urging Member States to raise value added tax by three or four or more percentage points, when a transaction tax of 0.01 or 0.05 percentage points will supposedly ruin competition and weaken Europe’s position. I cannot believe that. Take action. That is what Parliament wishes. Udo Bullmann,

Mr President, Commissioner, the Single Euro Payments Area is an important, indeed central, instrument of the European single market. It is thanks to Mr Gauzès that we have got it off the ground. My group is fully behind it and would like to see it working well. I personally also have nothing against us setting a deadline for the migration, and here to me it is not so much a question of whether it takes three, four or five months as the fact that it then actually works. Whether it actually works depends on two things. Firstly the appeal to industry that it must be end-user friendly. These days, we cannot afford any rumours, any secret resistance, any hankering after the old system. Therefore, it must be functioning properly, also in respect of those who ultimately have to use it. Secondly, it must, of course, also work for the benefit of the economy. Here I would like to mention one point, which is still a bone of contention, namely the matter of how direct debits will be calculated. Here, the economy does not yet seem to be in a position to propose a sensible model. There are still snags, there are still sticking points and if the economy is not in a position to present a common model that works within the European Union, then the Commission – as stipulated in this proposal for a resolution – must present a concrete proposal within a certain period of time, let us say before the end of the year. It should not be the case that we confront the economy and demand a deadline for the migration, but do not take the initiative to remove the resistance that the payment service providers are obviously not in the position to overcome single-handedly. We need a community initiative here, so the whole thing can work. That is our approach to the discussion. Udo Bullmann  (S&amp;D

 Madam President, President of the European Council, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, I would like to briefly address two points. Firstly, do we already have a Europe 2020 strategy that promises success? No, as yet, we do not. I will tell you why. If, in the Commission and the Member States, you say that we will first carry out a rapid consolidation of the budgets and then deal with the economy and employment, then this is a miscalculation. If you do not believe us, read the statement issued by the International Monetary Fund yesterday. Private sector demand is a long way from recovery. We are concerned about public investment. If you do not pursue an integrated strategy with specific employment goals at the centre, we will have no chance of dealing with the crisis. Secondly, do we have an answer to the debt crisis in the countries that are under the most pressure? No, as yet we do not. More than one country has made mistakes. However, if you read the data carefully and listen to the analysts, then you know that at least half of the Greek excesses are the fault of speculators – the speculators that, for five years, the Commission did not want to regulate – the hedge funds. Now we are finally doing that, but what does it actually mean in practice? We need a European monetary fund, a fund to help these countries. We need to be able to offer credit at sensible rates not only outside the euro area, but within it, too, with conditions attached. However, we need to establish a European policy to solve the crisis – and we need to do so now. Udo Bullmann,  
on behalf of the S&amp;D Group.

Madam President, Mr Almunia, during this transition period in particular, I thank you for your commitment to your previous mandate and I wish you luck in your new role. I would also like to extend this wish to your successor, Mr Rehn. I wish him courage and luck for the important tasks he is taking on. There are three things we can learn from the present situation. The first is that what Mr Barroso has presented to us as Europe 2020 is lacking in substance. It is a long way from being sufficient to create the coherence in the European Union that we urgently need in order to prevent the situation that we are currently facing from occurring again in the future. This strategy needs substance, and I hope that the scheduled milestones in the next few weeks will provide the opportunity to improve on it. We urgently need better coordination of economic policy. The Spanish Presidency is right to emphasise this. The Presidency should not allow itself to be intimidated in this regard. The second thing we can learn from the current situation is that some Member States are, of course, in need of modernisation and the figures are surely correct in this regard. However, there is a need for modernisation in more than one country. There are also countries that have to do more, because they are able to do more. I have no doubt that the new Greek Finance Minister, Mr Papakonstantinou, will do an excellent job and I do not know any sincere politicians who would dispute that. He deserves our trust and we should give him our support. The third thing we can learn is that the European Union must be armed. If the markets put the euro area to the test, then Europe must be a position to respond to this and it must be possible for the response to be unconventional. If there is further speculation against individual countries, we must be in a position to make credit available under average European rating terms. That will need to be organised. We can find support for this kind of action in the Treaty of Lisbon. I would say to the Council and the Commission: be prepared for the need to negotiate. Udo Bullmann  (S&amp;D

 Mr President, even as we today congratulate Mrs Alvarez, Mr Domenici and our other fellow members on their excellent reports, even as we congratulate Commissioner Kovács on his committed work and wish him all the best with his future work, and even as we express the hope that he will pass on to his successor the passion with which he has fought for a common tax policy, we must also then mention Member States, those Member States who continue to hesitate in taking action that is more than necessary in this crisis situation, action which will finally usher in better cooperation. It is quite shocking that we still have not made any breakthrough on the question of the tax base. Anyone who thinks that they will be able to defend their sovereignty in this way will lose it, just as they will lose their tax revenue. Therefore, the main message of these reports is that we must forge better cooperation in Europe. Only that will lead to progress! Udo Bullmann,  
on behalf of the S&amp;D Group.

Mr President, President-in-Office of the Council, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, first and foremost, there can be no ‘as you were’ in the current economic situation. That will only allow us to make a slow recovery and we shall see a further dramatic increase in unemployment figures, including here in Europe. You must therefore be bold. That is the most important message this Parliament can give the Pittsburgh delegates. Be bold! Mr Almunia, I have listened to a refreshing speech from you, on which I should like to congratulate you. Now you need to start putting it into practice. It is good to start with the bonus systems, but it is not enough. We need a gear shift wherever short-term speculators are at an advantage on the international financial market, because the rules are wrong, over those who wish to make long-term investments in jobs, in products of excellence and in the long-term success of their company. It is right to say that no risky players, no risky financial centre can remain without reasonable regulation, which is why we need regulation of the offshore centres from which dubious products are flooding the entire world. That is the most important task that we must now set ourselves. Nor should you be frightened of discussing fiscal policy – it is not prohibited. A global transaction tax which benefits long-term investors would take us forward in this discussion as a whole. We need strong, improved coordination of our international, as well as our European, economic policy. It is right to think about an exit strategy, but it is even more important at the moment that we work out how we can give more solid support to the economy and improve the coordination of our economic policy. Udo Bullmann,  
on behalf of the S&amp;D Group.

 Mr President, Commissioners, ladies and gentlemen, in this situation, where, after a struggle that has gone on for months, the way is finally open to a solution in which, of the in excess of 50 000 directly-affected jobs, probably – at least according to what the new investors are telling us – around 40 000 can be saved, not counting the many jobs amongst suppliers and in dependent local businesses, it is now time to address the workforce of General Motors in Europe. It was their dispute, they – Klaus Franz as the Chairman of the Full Works Council and all the others – became the face of Opel Europe, from a new technology group that has earned its opportunity, and in such a situation, our policy must help. What is it that we are discussing? We are discussing how General Motors in the US staggered on for months. It came within a whisker – and we know this for certain, ladies and gentlemen – of failing. What, then, could have been more reasonable than to have seized the initiative, moved forwards and said, ‘OK then. We have to jump in here and give people a chance. We must give not just the production sites, but also the future technologies, a chance so that Europe can remain a good place to produce cars.’ I can fully identify with the outlook that Commissioner Špidla set out for the European car industry. Let us make it real! Let us create an industrial policy framework with world-leading environmental standards so that employees and car makers in Europe can develop within them right here. We managed it before with coal and steel. Why should we not also now succeed in doing it for the industry of mobility and the future? Grab the ball! The Commission has a lot of room to act here, and it can launch a lot of initiatives. Commissioner Kroes, according to my information, of the 4.5 billion that form part of the deal that has to be reached, you have already approved 1.5 billion so that the wheels keep turning. Naturally, you must check the law and the legislation – what is the alternative? Of course, all necessary steps must be taken to bring about a fair distribution of burdens in the future negotiations. I implore you, however, to conduct your checks quickly, to consistently come to a conclusion but, given what is at stake, it is absolutely vital that this opportunity not be destroyed. It must not fail on trivialities. Instead, we must also note the significance of the situation and we must achieve a European solution, in the public interest, that benefits everyone.

Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, with our report on small-scale fishing, we are underlining the fact that we are sensitive to the needs of traditional and artisanal fishermen and listen to their concerns. Traditional fishing produces more jobs and less CO2
 per kilo of catch than industrial fishing. The small-scale fishing lobby, however, is weaker. That is why we must be vigilant and ensure that it is not put at a disadvantage in the allocation of quotas, for example. We will also be voting tomorrow on Parliament’s position on the external dimension of the Common Fisheries Policy. This report is intended to form the basis for our future decisions, for example on fisheries agreements. I am pleased that with one exception, all groups were able to agree on a text.  A minority has now drafted a resolution which I hope will be rejected by a majority of the House. The comments that have been made about shark-finning give me cause for optimism. Here, the PPE appears to be endorsing the majority opinion, albeit at the last minute. Shark-finning must be banned in the EU at long last, without any legal loopholes. Ulrike Rodust  (S&amp;D

 Mr President, Mr Cioloş, ladies and gentlemen, we are in the middle of reforming the common agricultural policy and Parliament, in its new role of colegislator, will tomorrow adopt the first regulation from the reform package on the application of direct payments for the transitional year 2013. This is a positive development and an important moment. I would particularly like to thank the rapporteur, Mr Capoulas Santos, for his very good work which, most importantly, was completed quickly. This regulation must come into force on 1 January 2014 to ensure that there are no financing problems during the transition from the current regulation to the next reformed regulation on direct payments. Therefore, it was particularly important for Parliament and the Council to reach an agreement quickly. Continuity in financing is a decisive factor for the Member States. This is why it is so important that the transitional regulation for 2013 comes into force at the right time. The current regulation on direct payments remains valid in 2013, but some of the financial provisions in the regulation only apply until 2012. I welcome the solution identified by Parliament and the Council, and particularly the transfer from Pillar 1 to Pillar 2. Ulrike Rodust  (S&amp;D

 Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I welcome the fact that we are drawing attention to the animal disease caused by the Schmallenberg virus today through this oral question, as it shows that we take this issue seriously. Many farmers have been waiting desperately for this moment. As you have already heard, 944 holdings have already been hit by the Schmallenberg virus in Germany alone. This has caused huge problems for these farms. Because of its proximity to the coast and the protection of its dykes, my own region of Schleswig-Holstein has a large number of sheep farmers. Many sheep have been infected with this virus. The virus threatens the survival of many farming businesses, particularly at present in the lambing season. The number of cases continues to rise. Both sheep and beef farmers are suffering from the effects of this virus in Schleswig-Holstein. In the last week alone, the number of cases in my region has risen from 106 farms with infected animals last week to 116 farms this week. Even though the virus does not pose a threat to humans, farming businesses are suffering serious financial losses due to deformities and still-births. I would also like to draw your attention to the suffering of the animals. I believe that this is also something unacceptable. We urgently need a vaccine. I would be interested to know what progress has been made by researchers in this regard and whether the Commission is supporting Member States in the search for a vaccine. Perhaps we should also consider whether it is possible to help the farms that have been financially hit by the virus in some other way. What options are open to the Commission here and what steps have already been taken? Please act quickly and keep us informed of developments. Our farmers are counting on you, and on us.

 Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, what are we dealing with here today? We are trying to adopt multi-annual plans for our fishing stocks in order to bring an end to overfishing in our seas. Multi-annual plans are the key tool in our fisheries policy. The fish in question today, the Atlantic horse mackerel, is just one example of many. We aim to produce management plans for all commercially fished species. Almost exactly 16 months ago, we were here in the House and Parliament adopted its position on this multi-annual plan. We have had the attempt to negotiate with the Council. Unfortunately nothing came of the talks, as the fisheries ministers within the Union apparently would like to work without involving Parliament when it comes to important issues. Over the past 16 months, the Council has not budged an inch. It has demonstrated complete obstinacy, a quality that is not a bad one to have in politics, but in this case it is scandalous. The Council has ensured that there are absolutely no new long-term management plans in place. It is as if the tug of war between the institutions were more important than a sensible policy for our fishermen, for our environment and for our citizens. If we want people to be satisfied with the European Union, we must deliver results. In the area of fisheries policy, we have not done that for two years now. In the past, European fisheries policy was in the sole hands of the Council of Ministers. Unfortunately, the result was a disaster. That the ministers should now have the idea of continuing to make policy without Parliament’s involvement seems, against that backdrop, to be something of a bad joke! If we were to actually negotiate with one another about the reform of the common fisheries policy the citizens of the European Union would also observe who was going into bat for a progressive policy and who was putting the brakes on. Ministers, please take a look at yourselves and then manoeuvre yourselves out of this dead end as soon as possible. Ulrike Rodust  (S&amp;D

 Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, I welcome the approach taken in the regulation on contractual relations in the milk sector of strengthening the negotiating position of milk producers and ensuring fairer prices. It is important that we do not leave the milk producers high and dry once the milk quotas are abolished. Small and medium-sized family businesses, in particular, rely on the fact that they are supported by the European Union and not left unprotected at the mercy of the milk purchasers and retailers. I would have liked for us to have introduced mandatory contracts at Member State level. However, the Council and the Commission fought tooth and nail against the idea. It is a shame that the Council is not here now. I believe that the compromise that has now been reached is acceptable, but it does not go far enough. Therefore, we must ensure that the interests of small and medium-sized milk producers, in particular, are taken into consideration in the upcoming reform of the common agricultural policy. My main concern will continue to be fighting for a sustainable and multi-functional agriculture that covers the whole of Europe. Ulrike Rodust  (S&amp;D

 Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I am very pleased to see this topic addressed in plenary and I would like to offer my thanks to Mr Bové. It really is a very important issue that we are debating today, be it for producers, processors, for trade or for consumers. Production costs for farmers have risen sharply over recent years. Farmers can primarily feel the increasing overheads when it comes to energy bills and agricultural inputs. The heavy concentration of food retailing, above all, makes it more difficult for producers to obtain good prices for their products. Although the mark-up between the primary and the end product is sometimes considerable, not much of that reaches producers, as some of the margin is lost to each of the various processing steps. Politicians can intervene in competition policy, but we must be careful when doing so, and, in certain areas, we have to trust to market forces. I consider it important to let consumers know that buying regional products from their producers or makers supports both the farmers and the local economy. That is where I see our role. We should intervene in this connection, be it with money or with political instruments. I believe strengthening regionalism provides a tool to do this. In the reform of the common agricultural policy, we need to make other tools available. For me as a Social Democrat, it is important that access to wholesome food at reasonable prices should be guaranteed for all, while, at the same time, farmers must be able to receive a fair and reasonable income for their work. This demand requires us not to shirk our responsibility, and indeed to live up to it. Every time we act, we need to ask ourselves if we are living up to these demands. If not, the result will be social unrest in the long run. Farmers and consumers are in the same boat. Let us ensure that that boat never sinks. Ulrike Rodust,

 Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, this House has now been dealing with the fisheries agreement between the European Union and Morocco for over a year, and I am sure that tomorrow’s vote will not be the end of it. This agreement has become a highly emotive issue. The whole of Parliament is talking about the agreement; the debate has been a matter of controversy within all the groups in recent days and weeks. This is a fisheries agreement that needs careful analysis. What is the result of such analysis? Those of us who are members of the Committee on Fisheries are agreed that this agreement is not ecologically sustainable, because it contributes to overfishing. I regret to say that this has rather been forgotten in the debate so far, but nonetheless it is a key point. In view of the catastrophic state of the world’s seas, the European Union should not be allowed to overfish its own waters, much less waters belonging to third countries. This protocol also has no economic merit. There is no win-win situation for us. In addition, there remains the Western Sahara question. I am sure we are agreed that the agreement must be in accordance with international law. The current protocol on which we are going to vote has all these shortcomings. For this reason, it is not possible to vote in favour of it. We are now being consoled with the idea that it will all change in the future. I hope that is so, and that our resolution will help the Council and the Commission to get things right in the negotiations with Morocco. The only convincing reason for voting in favour is that the protocol is about to expire and the Commission has asked us not to bring about a break in it, because that would make the new negotiations more difficult. It assures us that all our demands will be incorporated into the new protocol. Not only is that something I am expecting, but indeed I am relying on it being the case. Ulrike Rodust  (S&amp;D

 Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, illegal fishing poses a serious threat to our fish stocks and to all honest fishermen, who are being swindled out of part of their income. At this point, I would like to take the unusual step of praising the Council of Ministers, which succeeded in agreeing an IUU regulation before the Treaty of Lisbon came into force, in other words, without our cooperation. That was an important step forward. However, Ms Lövin’s excellent report makes it clear that there is still a lot of work to do. Illegal fishing is a typical example of problems that are so big that the European Union cannot deal with them on its own. We need global solutions. The fact is that global solutions require effective global institutions. As the rapporteur on reform of the common fisheries policy, I would like to close with the following remark: the best protection against illegal fishing is afforded by fishermen who know the rules and who are convinced that these make sense. This must be our guiding principle in pursuing new reforms. Ulrike Rodust  (S&amp;D

 Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I would like to make one thing clear in advance. As a Social Democrat, it is important to me to help needy people. However, for me the focus is primarily on creating jobs, in order to enable people to take care of themselves. In my opinion, the food aid programme for needy people in its current form is not the right way of helping people to help themselves. I see this as charity, which is damaging to people’s dignity. It seems relatively clear to me that buying food and distributing it free of charge to needy people is not agricultural policy. It falls within the realms of social policy. Under the terms of the current legal basis, social policy is a matter for the Member States. In Germany there is a system of food banks. Volunteer helpers collect food which can no longer be used by supermarkets, for example. Given the fact that 89 million tonnes of food goes to landfill every year in Europe, initiatives of this kind make sense, but they are also charitable in nature. Let us create sensible infrastructures to ensure that people do not have to rely on charity. This means, for example, allowing them to be independent by providing good jobs and good pensions.

 Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, I would like to thank the rapporteur and I am pleased that the report bears unmistakably socialist, social democratic hallmarks. We want a sustainable, ecological and social agricultural policy. We want greening and we want it in the first pillar. Cross-compliance and the agro-environmental measures of the system to date are not enough to achieve support for the whole of society, but that is precisely what we need. Our primary objective must be to ensure high-quality and sustainable food production in Europe and for our rural areas to be active and vital. We absolutely have to stop the increasing land abandonment, because we need people. People to look after the agricultural sector, as well as the areas upstream and downstream. The rumours emanating from the Commission concerning plans for massive cuts in rural development in the next multiannual financial framework are not acceptable. We must continue to work for a strong second pillar in the common agricultural policy (CAP), for rural areas and for Europe. I would like to issue a general warning to anyone intending to cut agricultural funding. If this is done, there will be no reform. Everything will then stay the same as it is. That will be quite inexplicable to the citizens of Europe. Ulrike Rodust  (S&amp;D

 Mr President, Commissioner, I come from the region of Europe where the outbreak of the EHEC pathogen is at its raging worst. This aggressive bacteria seems unstoppable. Between mid-May and noon yesterday, 1 733 people were infected, while 23 patients died a torturous death. The situation in the clinics is extremely fraught. Intensive care beds are running out, and blood plasma is needed urgently. No end is in sight. The people of my home area fear new cases every day. For me, it is a question of courage and a sense of responsibility to warn about every even potential carrier of this bacterium. Various foodstuffs have been analysed, but it has not been found. My understanding of high grade foodstuffs is that they are healthy and that they are placed on the market subject to monitoring. I am presuming that glaring errors have been made in this regard, and once again, we are finding out that there are loopholes. However, to claim, in this situation, that the cause is known, without having well-founded laboratory research to back it up, is negligent in the extreme. In all the understandable panic, there must not, under any circumstances, be a witch-hunt, as that would drive many hard-working farmers throughout Europe to the wall. It therefore needs to be clear to everyone that we in the European Union need to show solidarity with one another and stand ready to provide mutual assistance in the event of emergencies. In other words, all the medical experts must sit down together, and economic assistance needs to be provided to those who innocently find themselves facing financial disaster. Ulrike Rodust  (S&amp;D

 Madam President, Mr Andor, ladies and gentlemen, we must do everything we can to counteract the spread of antibiotic resistance. We are in complete agreement on this. This involves the responsible use of antibiotics in human medicine and in animal husbandry. The European Union must take determined action. We must not allow 25 000 people to go on dying from infections caused by resistant bacteria every year in the European Union alone. Antibiotics must not be used routinely or preventively. We must ensure that antibiotics are used responsibly in all the Member States. It is of the utmost importance that every possible effort is made to keep livestock healthy from the rearing stage onwards, until they are fully grown. Ensuring that animals are healthy is the best means of avoiding infection and the use of antibiotics. The way the animals are fed is decisive in this respect, but the husbandry is also important. We should also be open to the use of alternative methods, such as homeopathy and phytotherapy, in livestock husbandry. We need more research and more information in Europe about these alternative approaches. Ulrike Rodust  (S&amp;D

Madam President, open borders are an important symbol for Europe. I would like to draw your attention to another problem. I come from Northern Germany, which is why the German-Danish border is of particular importance for me. The right-wing populist Danish People’s Party is trying to force the Danish Government to reintroduce border controls. What is the reason for this? It is a fear of people from Romania and Bulgaria. This is scandalous. The right-wing populists are rapidly growing in numbers and represent a real danger for Europe. Of course we must have protections against untrammelled criminality and our security authorities have already found effective alternatives to passport controls. It makes me very sad that one of our major European achievements is to be put at risk. The EU success in promoting peace and freedom is without historical parallel but is now under high-level attack. I would call on the Danish Government not to allow itself to be dictated to by the right-wing populists. Ulrike Rodust,

 Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, European fisheries are in a state of deep crisis, as my fellow Members have said. Fishermen in all European seas complain about the painful drop in income, which may be severe enough to threaten their existence. Yet, why is the income of our fishermen decreasing? As far as I can see, there are three reasons for this. Firstly, there is the decline in fish stocks; secondly, the general fall in prices in precisely the area where fish stocks are healthy and supply is too high; and thirdly – and this is what we are concerned about today – operating costs are higher as a result of rising crude oil prices. We politicians need to step in here. We must do what we can to help. I would stress that we can only do what we can. The motion for a resolution tabled by the Group of the European People’s Party (Christian Democrats) promises more than we can deliver. It demands an increase of 100% in the de minimis
 aid ceiling from EUR 30 000 to EUR 60 000, which is to be used to fund fuel subsidies. However, fuel subsidies are something that many Member States really cannot afford. Therefore, most fishermen would not be helped by this at all. Moreover, the other two problems would still remain: firstly, overfishing would actually increase and, secondly, it would not solve the problem of market prices. Where financial support for fisheries is concerned, I can see a much greater problem. The Member States do not use the resources of the European Fisheries Fund, although the European Union pays 50%. Something urgently needs to change in this regard in the interests of our fishermen. Ladies and gentlemen, let us work together to produce a differentiated text by Thursday and jointly come up with a sensible, sustainable and less showy fisheries policy. Ulrike Rodust,

 Mr President, Commissioner Damanaki, ladies and gentlemen, once again we find a whole package of fisheries policies on the agenda. In my capacity as coordinator, I am pleased to see that we have reached a compromise with the Council and Commission on two regulations. I refer to the Grelier report on technical measures and the Ferreira report on the second financial instrument. We shall also be able to vote in favour of the fisheries agreement with the Union of the Comoros, although I do not wish to hide the fact that I would like to see a fundamental realignment of the partnership agreements within the framework of the reform of the common fisheries policy. However, there are real problems between the institutions in relation to Greenland, where Parliament’s powers are not respected. I am gradually losing patience with the fact that the level of cooperation between the institutions is still so poor. This is something that I have raised time and time again already. I am raising the issue again today. The problem with the management plans must be resolved as a matter of urgency. I would appeal to the Hungarian Presidency of the Council to actively press for a solution. The fact that there is no representative from the Council here today is a clear sign of the Council’s lack of respect for Parliament. I find this incredible. One final remark about the Grelier report. I am aware that some of my fellow Members are frustrated because it was not possible to incorporate the amendments they wanted. However, I find it very regrettable that our fishermen are forced to work with out-of-date technical measures. The fault in this case lies with the Council, which has been unable to agree to a new regulation. As a Parliament we have a great deal of responsibility, which is why we need to act responsibly and extend the existing regulation without amendments. Ulrike Rodust  (S&amp;D

Madam President, food prices have reached new record highs. The volatility of food prices has increased in recent years for various reasons. There is, therefore, great cause for concern. Climate change is causing extreme weather conditions and in some countries whole crops have been destroyed. In addition, there is increasing speculation on food, the danger of which cannot be overestimated – you only have to look at the financial crisis. Moreover, there is increasingly often competition between providing food for the poor and running the cars of the rich. We need to find solutions so that farmers have sufficient incentive to produce food and that only areas that are not used for food production are used for the production of the likes of biofuels. For me as a Social Democrat it is important that everyone has access to wholesome food at reasonable prices and at the same time that farmers are able to receive a reasonable income for their work.

Madam President, Commissioner, I am rather surprised by your remarks. My perception of the press – at least in Germany – is somewhat different. It makes me extremely angry, too, that again and again, we are faced with scandals in the area of food safety. We cannot allow this to happen. I am aware that regulations and laws alone cannot prevent criminal activities in this area. However, we must do everything we can to make it as difficult as possible for those responsible. The Commission must call on the Member States to urgently review the level of their penalties in this area. The wilful and negligent handling of food and feed must not be punished with trivial penalties. Often, the fine is so low compared with the profit that it is paid out of the petty cash. It is also extremely important to increase the number of state inspectors. The current example in Germany demonstrates very well that the principle of self-checking has major shortcomings. I would like to point out that the polluter pays principle needs to be applied consistently throughout the whole chain – from trough to table. After all, the safety of our food begins with what we feed to our animals. Innocent people should not have to suffer the consequences of the criminal behaviour of others. As yet, it is not clear who will pay for the losses suffered by farmers as a result of the dioxin scandal. One thing is certain: it will not be the polluters that have gone bankrupt, as there is absolutely no money left there. This is unacceptable. In this regard, a European fund should be considered that all feedstuff manufacturers would have to pay into. The problems that keep occurring in connection with food safety continue to make one thing clear: for the whole process chain, for both food as well as feed, we need to ensure complete traceability. The EU regulation and national legislation need to be improved in this regard. Ulrike Rodust  (S&amp;D

 Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, as coordinator for the Committee on Fisheries, I find the fisheries aspect of this interim agreement particularly interesting. In this regard, there were a few controversial issues at the start with regard to the relaxation of the rules of origin for Papua New Guinea. I support the Commission’s idea of using this relaxation to stimulate the economy of one of the poorest countries in the world. I am convinced that this is also something that should be of concern to those of us involved in fisheries policy. At the same time, I can understand the concerns of the European industry, but I cannot honestly imagine that the relaxations granted will lead to Papua New Guinea becoming a serious competitor of our canning industry. However, we need to be vigilant, because it will clearly not help anyone if we relocate half our canning industry to the Pacific region. In this regard, I have to say, however, that during the debate on this agreement, we have been presented with very contradictory information regarding the question of the extent to which investments are being made in Papua New Guinea and which states are profiting indirectly from the relaxation of the rules of origin. I would therefore urgently call on the Commission to closely monitor the application of this derogation and to submit a report to Parliament in a timely manner on the impact on Papua New Guinea’s development and on the European canning industry. If this arrangement does not have the desired effect in Papua New Guinea and entails unacceptable losses for European companies, we will have to make a different decision when we come to negotiate the final agreement. Please keep us informed of developments. Ulrike Rodust  (S&amp;D

 Mr President, Commissioner, at this point, I would like once again to point out that a decision has already been made to ban the practice of battery farming in cages. The Member States and the egg producers have had plenty of time to implement the directive for the abandonment of conventional battery practices. The time has not run out quite yet – there are still twelve months to go before the practice is to be completely banned. I believe that we must ensure that battery farming is completely banned by 1 January 2012. It must be possible to threaten the Member States who have not succeeded in implementing the directive by then with legal action, such as financial penalties. We also need to ensure that eggs which originate from farming practices that do not comply with European law are not sold in the internal European market. Ulrike Rodust  (S&amp;D

 I would like to draw the attention of the Council to a problem which is threatening to paralyse the cooperation between the two institutions on the subject of fisheries policy. This is about the regulations for long-term management plans. These regulations lie at the heart of the common fisheries policy. The Council and a majority of the Member States do not accept that the Treaty of Lisbon has given the European Parliament the right of codecision on these regulations. The ministers are acting in opposition to the Council and the Council’s legal service, in opposition to the opinion of the Commission and in opposition, of course, to the will of the European Parliament. The Council currently has two management plans which cannot be adopted. The Commission cannot submit further plans, which are urgently needed in the interests of our fishermen and our seas and which have long since been completed and are lying in a drawer. This situation is unacceptable. I am calling on the Belgian Presidency and the future Hungarian Presidency to start negotiations with Parliament immediately, so that we can find a solution. We are ready to begin discussions. Thank you very much. Ulrike Rodust  (S&amp;D

 Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, I support the compromise reached for the resolution. As coordinator for the Group of the Progressive Alliance of Socialists and Democrats in the European Parliament in the Committee on Fisheries, I am also interested in the fisheries agreement with Morocco. It is good that we are calling for the resolution for international law to be respected in connection with the exploitation of resources in Western Sahara. Unfortunately, most Members of this House are not aware that there is an opinion issued by Parliament’s legal service which states that the current fisheries agreement with Morocco contravenes international law if it is not demonstrated that the people of Western Sahara benefit from the agreement. There is currently no demonstration of this and the European Commission has therefore put negotiations concerning renewal of the agreement on hold. I very much hope that a diplomatic solution can be found here. However, it has to be clear to us that we cannot ignore international law on account of economic interests. Ulrike Rodust  (S&amp;D

 Madam President, Mr Cioloş, ladies and gentlemen, bees play a decisive role in our ecosystem. On the one hand, they are important for the preservation of biodiversity and, on the other, biodiversity is important for the preservation of the bees, not only because this is the International Year of Biodiversity, but also because they contribute to our own survival. As part of the reform of the common agricultural policy, we should focus, among other things, on preventing monocultures and increasing the use of wide crop rotation. I do not want to talk about plant protection products and pesticides today. I think that it is important to promote and develop research in this area and to improve the coordination between different research projects in the individual Member States in order to ensure that we have healthy bees. Whatever happens, we should continue to support the beekeeping sector beyond 2013 and also make sure that in future, we have both enough bees and enough beekeepers to care for them.

 Mr President, Mrs Damanaki, I am very pleased that this week, we are able to adopt four important regulations on fisheries policy, and that we have been able to reach agreement among ourselves as well as with the Council and Commission on the reports concerning aquaculture and technical measures in the Baltic Sea. Unfortunately, the same cannot be said for the two regulations on long-term management plans. The right formula for management of sardine stocks has always been subject to considerable argument among the committee. I believe that the submission to plenary looks very good and I am pleased that it seems that the Group of the European People’s Party (Christian Democrats) has also now realised this, as it has tabled no more amendments. I assume that you will be voting in favour tomorrow. We have a much more serious problem where the Council is concerned, however. Contrary to the advice of their own legal experts, the majority of the Member States are refusing to accept the European Parliament’s right of codecision – a full year after the entry into force of the Treaty of Lisbon! I consider that outrageous. I have therefore suggested to the chair of our committee that a joint letter be written to the European fisheries ministers. I would be pleased if we could reach agreement in the coming days so that together, we can demonstrate how determined Parliament is. We will not allow ourselves to be fobbed off by the Council so easily. Ulrike Rodust,

 Mr President, Commissioner Damanaki, ladies and gentlemen, I am pleased that we are able to adopt a regulation that represents one more small step towards our shared goal of sustainable fisheries. The regional fisheries organisations are extraordinarily important institutions for good management worldwide. Unfortunately, the negotiations are often difficult and progress much too slow for impatient people such as me. We must therefore do all we can to strengthen the regional fisheries organisations. I will now comment on the specific outcome of the NEAFC report. I believe that the new port state control ruling in the NEAFC and the new measures to prevent illegal fisheries are very much to be welcomed. Nonetheless, we had to conduct intensive negotiations with the Council and Commission on matters that seem extremely technical at first glance, but which are important for our future work. I think we have found a compromise that is acceptable to all parties in the matter of delegated acts. We also succeeded in reaching agreement on how future NEAFC decisions are to be transposed into EU law. It is no secret, however, that the Commission is not very happy with the result achieved here. I can understand that. We cannot allow it to take years for the European Union to implement NEAFC decisions. In this respect, Council and Parliament must together prove that we are able to conclude a codecision procedure quickly where necessary. Finally, I would like to say something about a matter that is very current: the dispute with Iceland over mackerel fishing. We already have the NEAFC, which governs the international waters of the North-East Atlantic. In the case of migratory species such as mackerel, however, we also need an agreement that applies in territorial waters. As you know, that is still a sticking point. I feel it is extremely regrettable that, despite the cooperation working in the main, there is so much dispute over this. How about giving the regional fisheries organisations authority for coastal waters – at least for migratory species? It would be a radical step, of course, but undoubtedly one worth considering.

 Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, we should vote in favour of this report on the animal experiments directive. In its negotiations with the Commission and the Council, Parliament has achieved a great deal: namely replacement, reduction and refinement. It is true that from an animal welfare perspective, we are still doing too little. However, the Council was not prepared to do more and has made it clear that there would be no new directive if we did not accept these results. This does not mean that we cannot continue to make progress in this area in future. Animal welfare and research must be given high priority in our policies. I would be very happy if we were able to stop animal experiments completely today. Unfortunately, we are a long way from achieving this goal and, therefore, we must ensure that we provide animals with as much protection as possible. The compromise that has been negotiated offers a far better foundation for doing this. The only important thing is to make sure that all the Member States implement the new directive consistently. I would like to thank the rapporteur and all the shadow rapporteurs warmly for their hard work. Ulrike Rodust  (S&amp;D

I thank the rapporteur. Many ideas from my group have been worked into the report before us, and now we have a very good result. Our primary goal must be to ensure high-quality food production in Europe. In the discussion on the organisation of agrarian reform, there was frequent talk of compensation of public goods. In my opinion, this debate goes in the right direction. Only if the citizens of the EU are convinced that efforts are really being made and money is not simply being paid out across the board will the common agricultural policy get the recognition that it deserves. The development of rural areas plays an ever greater role. In order to prevent the obliteration and desertification of our agriculture, we must develop further instruments that will stop the rural exodus. Active rural areas are an attractive living environment not just for farmers, but also for people who do not want to live in cities. We should approve the report as it stands with a large majority in plenary in order to send a clear outward signal. Ulrike Rodust  (S&amp;D

 Mr President, Mrs Damanaki, European fisheries policy is facing enormous challenges. Our fishermen have to cope with diminishing stocks and at the same time have to deal with competition on the global market that is not always fair. We urgently need to introduce radical reforms in order to put an end to overfishing in European waters and to ensure the survival of European fisheries. I agree with Commissioner Damanaki that we should not ask too much of our fishermen by on the one hand demanding that they make radical reforms while on the other liberalising trade. Doing both of these things at the same time will place too high a burden on our fishermen. The best way to increase competitiveness is to allow fish stocks to recover. Another way to enable European fisheries to survive would be through better marketing. Under certain circumstances, European consumers are prepared to pay more for European fish if they are better informed about its origin. Ulrike Rodust  (S&amp;D

 Mr President, I have not asked for the floor to raise a point of order, but I would like to ask you, Mr President, and my fellow Members to be aware of the following: there is a problem with the translation here. I have tabled an amendment to the Lyon report, recital Ae: ‘whereas the CAP must be geared to the maintenance and development of multifunctional, sustainable agriculture throughout Europe.’ Unfortunately, the word ‘extensive’ has been used in the translations. However, the word ‘flächendeckend’ in the German translation has a completely different meaning. It means ‘in all of the regions of Europe’. There should be agriculture (‘flächendeckend’ agriculture) even throughout mountainous regions. ‘Extensive’ means something entirely different. Ulrike Rodust  (S&amp;D

Madam President, I would like to thank Mrs Damanaki and Mr Oettinger. Their words give us hope. Although the Gulf of Mexico is a long way away, the disaster may affect our animal life too, fish in particular. If the oil from the Gulf is driven into the open Atlantic, it could affect the spawning grounds of the European eel, for example, which was already threatened with extinction prior to the oil catastrophe. This is not a natural event, but rather an unbelievable disaster triggered by human error. For this reason, we must do all we can to ensure something like this never happens again. We are responsible for the safety of European oil platforms. We need to put our laws to the test because European environmental liability provisions are not enforceable in the event of oil catastrophes on the high seas. There are over 400 oil platforms in the North Sea alone. In view of the fact that the European Union has 320 000 km of maritime coast, it is essential that we should move away from oil and towards a future based on renewable energies. I call on the Commission to propose concrete solutions and to act quickly. Ulrike Rodust  (S&amp;D

 Madam President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, the so-called compromise proposal that will be tabled next week in Agadir is, in my view, completely unacceptable. A resumption of commercial whaling is something that the majority of the European public will not understand. I call on the Commission and the Member States to speak out at the meeting in Morocco against the reintroduction of commercial whaling. Of course, on paper the compromise does not, at first sight, look so bad. Its supporters say that it will permit even fewer whales to be hunted than is currently the case. The compromise proposal provides for the introduction of quotas. Let me tell you something from my own experience of quotas in fisheries policy. Quotas, particularly when they apply worldwide, are systematically circumvented. Just look at bluefin tuna. Here quotas are laid down year after year that are systematically exceeded many times over. There is another reason why the European Union should oppose this compromise. It provides for quotas only for those countries that currently – and I would say ‘semi-legally’ – carry out whaling. That would reward the systematic violation of the rules. We should not accept this under any circumstances. Supporters of whaling are hard-nosed in their methods. Japan has allegedly even collected votes from poorer Member States. That is yet another reason why the European Union needs to be united in its rejection of the reintroduction of commercial whaling.

 Madam President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, firstly, I would like to offer my sincere thanks to my fellow Member Mr Milana, who has managed to produce a first-class report. In view of the dramatic overfishing of our seas and the continually growing demand for fish products, alternatives to wild catches are needed now more than ever. However, aquaculture is only an alternative if ecological interests do not get ignored. For me, ecologically-sound aquaculture means, for example, that efforts need to be made to reduce the proportion of fish meal in the feed. Ultimately, we will help our seas very little if we catch 4 kilograms of wild fish in order to produce 1 kilogram of farmed fish. It is also important to avoid a negative impact on surrounding waters. In this regard, much needs to be done in the area of research. At the same time, we must ensure that fish farming does not degenerate into a form of animal cruelty as a result of high stocking densities. In this regard, I would particularly like to stress the fact that we urgently need to establish a maritime development plan. The coexistence of different interests such as aquaculture, fisheries, tourism and, not least, nature conservation must be organised well. All of this has been admirably expressed in our report. Incidentally, a stronger European aquaculture is also valuable from the point of view of employment policy, as it can create jobs in our often disadvantaged coastal regions. Ulrike Rodust  (S&amp;D

 Mr President, the catch documentation programme adopted by the International Commission for the Conservation of Atlantic Tunas (ICCAT) and confirmed by us today is a step in the right direction, but it comes too late. It must not be the case that we only take drastic measures once stocks of a threatened species are decimated to 6%. Illegal fishing is a particular problem here. I still very much regret the fact that the European Union did not succeed in obtaining a better outcome in the CITES negotiation. The ICCAT and other regional fisheries organisations must act with more foresight in future. It is therefore important that we as the European Parliament get more involved in these bodies to counterbalance the short-sighted national interests. The public interest in the sustainable management of fish stocks is becoming ever greater. It is important to convert this into a responsible policy. Mrs Damanaki, I can assure you that the Group of the Progressive Alliance of Socialists and Democrats in the European Parliament will support you in any activity that helps to maintain bluefin tuna stocks and to safeguard the livelihoods of the fishermen.

 Mr President, Mr Cioloş, I have in front of me an analysis of the economic situation in the German agricultural sector. The analysis involved the evaluation of 19 100 sets of accounts from full-time and part-time farms. The results have been projected on the basis of the distribution of farms from the Farm Structure Survey of 2007. In the financial year 2008-2009, the overall situation deteriorated significantly. The figures for the 18 200 full-time dairy and arable farms fell from EUR 45 400 to EUR 34 400. That represents a reduction of 24%. Particularly large losses occurred in 2008-2009. Operating results fell to EUR 29 300 (minus 45%) and to EUR 43 000 (minus 18%). In contrast, mixed livestock farms … (The President cut off the speaker) Ulrike Rodust  (S&amp;D

 Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, a warm welcome to all the fishermen and -women in the Chamber! Today’s vote represents a milestone for the European Parliament. For the first time since the ratification of the Treaty of Lisbon, we have the opportunity to express our opinions on the reform of the common fisheries policy (CFP). In the next few years, our power and our responsibilities will increase significantly. This report is acceptable and I would like to thank Mrs Patrão Neves and Mrs Andrés Barea for their hard work. We have succeeded in incorporating important social democratic concerns into the report. These include specific support for small-scale fisheries. Those affected will now be included in the decision-making process. Support must be given in particular to small family businesses. Their presence in the coastal regions not only provides jobs, but also increases the attractiveness of many of these regions for tourists. Some parts of this report still need improvement and we have tabled amendments for that purpose. We social democrats want to make it clear that one of the central problems is the outstanding overcapacity. It is a fact that environmental sustainability is a fundamental prerequisite for the economic survival of fishermen. Therefore, the environment must take priority. A third important point concerns the external aspects of the CFP and the partnership agreements with third countries. We move that paragraph 121, which puts undue emphasis on the interests of European fisheries, should be deleted. We should behave outside European waters in just the same way as we do at home. This means promoting sustainability, human rights and democracy throughout the world and ensuring that the income from partnership agreements does not disappear into the coffers of corrupt dictatorships. Finally, I would like to make one more fundamental point. European fisheries policy is a hot potato, because it involves so many powerful national interests. It will come as no surprise that these have led to heated debates within the groups in recent weeks. Fortunately, we have all succeeded in finding effective compromises. However, when it comes to the legislative process, we must focus more closely on this issue than we have today and come up with some common European solutions. We must leave the trivial problems of national greed to the Council. Ulrike Rodust  (S&amp;D

 Madam President, Commissioner, Council, I would like to begin by thanking my fellow Member Mr Capoulas Santos, who has made this resolution possible. Today we are talking about our dairy farmers and whether we are going to leave them in the lurch or deal with them in an honest manner. I do not believe that we should leave them in the lurch, but should be honest in our dealings with them. Yes, short-term measures to overcome the crisis are urgently needed. Yes, intervention is perfectly acceptable for a short period if the price of milk has reached rock bottom, and additional subsidies, loans and funds to combat the crisis are justified. However, what is totally unacceptable is, firstly, to start up discussions about milk quotas again and, secondly, to reintroduce tax-funded export refunds for products supplied to developing countries. We abandoned this one way street in 2003 and I appeal to you to keep it that way for the sake of our dairy farmers.Barbara Weiler  (S&amp;D

Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, the single market has become a matter of course for our citizens. Who can fail to remember with amusement the judgment of 1979 on Cassis de Dijon or the banana war with the United States? As we look at global trade wars or disputes, the European single market appears as a mainstay of the European philosophy: no barriers, no discrimination, legal certainty and fair competition.  Nevertheless, in the interplay between the global economic powers we, the European Union, must continue to safeguard the rights of consumers and SMEs and protect consumers against new dangers, for example, chemical substances or new, creative tricks by vendors, such as exist in the financial market. We social democrats support the Commission in its measures against dominant practices and unfair competition, regardless of who is involved, even when this applies to Microsoft or Google, to German energy companies or Gazprom. We must also observe Jacques Delors’s third point more closely: the single market also means solidarity, which unites. Barbara Weiler  (S&amp;D

 Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, I would like to thank the rapporteur and, above all, the whole team of shadow rapporteurs, for producing these proposals, which we will adopt tomorrow. Much has already been said about the benefits of standards. I would like to mention two further examples that we think are self-evident: the universal charger for mobile phones and, in future, the realisation of electromobility. Without standards, these things would absolutely not be possible. Unfortunately, not all of society knows how standards are produced. It is not this House – and nor will it be in future – it is national, European and international institutes like CEN and CENELEC that produce standards. The last 25 years has been a good period, but there were also a number of shortcomings, which we have now tidied up. The creation of standards was far too slow, far too expensive, too opaque and too unilateral in terms of participation. We have now rectified that with this proposal, and we will make access cheaper for small and medium-sized enterprises, too, we will involve the trade unions and the social partners, the consumer organisations, and we will link up with national, international and European bodies. I am also pleased about the sensible involvement in procurement. As a final point, I will deal with acceptance. This is something that we will still have to test out and check the state thereof. Germany’s DIN institute had serious concerns at the start of the debate about the direction that acceptance was moving in. I believe those concerns have since been resolved. The SME sector in Hesse, for example, has already provided me with feedback. I found out that it is pleased with this compromise, with this proposal from the rapporteur and the Committee on the Internal Market and Consumer Protection, and that it sees a series of improvements for the future.

 Madam President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, in the past week, I had the honour of speaking about the 20th anniversary of the completion of the internal market at a Franco-German partnership celebration. It was interesting to see how the guests reacted to this. They took it all for granted, and indeed it is good that citizens consider this something that goes without saying. The four fundamental freedoms are the core of the European Union, and I hope that we, as Parliament, will fight all joint attempts to erect new barriers and new borders, such as when the German Government and the former French Government attempted to erect new barriers, because the freedom of movement of our citizens is at least as important to us as the freedom of movement of capital or goods. In my view, Mr Busuttil has presented a good and helpful report. The internal market scoreboard, SOLVIT and other instruments are useful for establishing whether the governments really want European laws and whether the deficits are actually being reduced, as the Council has in fact agreed. We want the internal market to be simplified for consumers. We want SMEs to have easier access and we want all our citizens to profit from it. Interestingly, transposition is not always related to the size of the country. As has already been mentioned, Malta comes out best; Belgium, unfortunately, has not done so well. Mr Busuttil, your motion is also interesting and I have great sympathy for you, but I must point out that there are a few other demands in your report that already incorporate this, such as Article 18 on transparency, or Article 24, in which we call for correlation tables, or even Article 21, which suggests that the European Court of Justice could work more quickly. So perhaps we should work on this first. On behalf of the Group of the Progressive Alliance of Socialists and Democrats in the European Parliament, I should like to highlight four further aspects. Firstly, the transposition must be correct; that is, it does not have to be gold-plated, but it must not be lax and inadequate. Mr Chatzimarkakis, if I may have your ear for a moment: the two liberal camps in the national German Government are currently dabbling with the Payment Services Directive, and from what I have heard, initial reports are not encouraging. Now for my second point, which is that the internal market is also a way of overcoming the crisis, creates jobs and contributes to growth. Thirdly, we consider the procedures for the social protection of workers to be too cumbersome, because as far as we are concerned – and this is my only criticism, Commissioner Barnier – social cohesion is dealt with too briefly in this report. We will insist on this, because we have a long tradition of social cohesion. Finally, I would like to quote your former colleague, Jacques Delors, who said that the internal market works according to three principles: competition which stimulates, cooperation which strengthens and solidarity which unites.

 Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I would like to talk about the European Development Fund (EDF), and I am confident that we will be able to reach agreement in this area, not only in committee, but also in plenary. This debate – and this is surely also important to mention – is taking place under the very particular circumstances of the hard times of economic and financial crisis within the European Union and, essentially, also worldwide. That is precisely why the attention of the general public is also on our debate here concerning discharge and the review of the budget. After all, we all actually want the budget to be correctly implemented and for it to be meaningful and, above all – I mention this with regard to the EDF in particular – sustainable, too. The EDF is our most important instrument for reducing poverty, that is to say, in the best interests of the European Union, for preventing wars and also for giving people prospects for the future. I am absolutely convinced that that is also the way the citizens and taxpayers see it. The Social Democrats support the report that we voted on in committee, although this was only after our amendments had been adopted and the report took a slightly different direction, as meaningful and necessary criticism is only right and proper. However, as Ms Herczog already mentioned, an attempt at politicisation is being made here, for example, with regard to the criticism of the United Nations. It goes without saying that the UN must improve its efficiency and, in particular, become more transparent. However, it is also an important partner for our work and it has useful infrastructure. We must, in any case, provide training in our offices and increase capacity, as that is the only way to work efficiently. That is something I would like to emphasise and, to conclude, I would like to state that we need a common assessment of the error rate and, of course, also a different agricultural policy.

 Mr President, Baroness Ashton, ladies and gentlemen, Ms Oomen-Ruijten, your speech has made it clear to me that the Members who recently visited Myanmar together with me and Mr Langen as part of a delegation from the Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN) have a rather different view. It is no longer possible to say that the regime is still a junta. There are moves under way towards democracy that we have experienced at first hand and seen the effects of. I believe that everyone who has been involved in the introduction of democracy on the ground in Myanmar has been impressed, relieved and filled with enthusiasm. In my opinion, this is particularly true in the light of the debate that we have just held and the developments in Syria, Mali and Egypt. What can the EU do to ensure that this process continues in Myanmar? Sympathy alone is not enough. We need to share responsibility for further development aid projects and give them our support. We should encourage the ASEAN countries and, in particular, Myanmar’s neighbour, Thailand, to continue helping, as they have already done for a long period. However, we also need to lift the sanctions. The following comment recently appeared in a newspaper: Myanmar is a gold mine with huge quantities of raw materials, gas and oil, and all of this is now available. The estimate is that growth will reach a level of 6%. We must also help to ensure – not alone, but the EU is partly responsible for this – that the growth and the wealth in what is still, in part, a very poor country does not end up in the capitals of America, Europe and China, but reaches the population. Only then will there be stable, peaceful and democratic long-term development in the country. Barbara Weiler,

 Mr President, Commissioners, ladies and gentlemen, Malaysia is a wonderful country with age-old traditions and cultural riches. As members of the ASEAN delegation, we have frequently seen for ourselves how quickly and remarkably this country has grown. The resulting increase in economic power has led to Malaysia achieving top ten ranking when it comes to world growth rates, a fact that has greatly impressed us. It is for this reason that I would like to state on behalf of my own group, the Group of the Progressive Alliance of Socialists and Democrats in the European Parliament, as well as all those here who signed the resolution, that we find it impossible to understand why Malaysia still practises this outmoded method of chastisement, which harkens back to the country’s colonial past and which seems almost mediaeval to us in Europe. We are not alone in voicing this criticism: lawyers in Malaysia itself are equally opposed to the practice. Caning violates all United Nations human rights agreements and we believe that things need to change quickly. We welcomed the charter of the ASEAN states, which emphasises in several articles and the preamble that – and I quote – ‘the promotion and protection of human rights’ is among the essential requirements of the ASEAN Charter, which has also been ratified by Malaysia. Malaysia has long espoused democratic principles. However, this also involves the rule of law with universal standards. This is something we shall repeat again and again when we are in Malaysia and the ASEAN states, and the European Parliament will underline this with this resolution. Barbara Weiler,

 Madam President, President-in-Office of the Council, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, first of all, I would like to thank the team of shadow rapporteurs from the Committee on Legal Affairs and the Committee on Industry, Research and Energy, my colleagues and everyone who contributed to this splendid result. Without constructive and fair cooperation with the Commission and with the Belgian Presidency, we would certainly not have achieved this result. As rapporteur, I am – as you can imagine – very pleased with the result, firstly because we have made significant improvements in relation to the old directive, and secondly because we have introduced new ways to encourage better payment practices. We have achieved the goal. Well, I would prefer to say that the course has been set for improving the liquidity of SMEs, the small and medium-sized enterprises, and for securing investments in new products, new jobs and new processes. Why was it necessary to improve this directive? The legislation from 2000 was non-binding and not very efficient. In recent years, payment practices in almost all Member States have deteriorated, and this happened even before the financial and economic crisis. The reform was also requested by the small businesses that expressed their wishes within the framework of the Small Business Act. They wanted payment practices in Europe to be organised in a considerably more efficient manner. With regard to the results, I can say, firstly, that we have trodden a new path. We have strict rules. As a matter of principle, invoices must be paid within 30 days with few exceptions, and these must be justified. We have introduced a higher late payment interest rate of 8%. We have set the recovery costs at a completely non-bureaucratic fixed amount of EUR 40, and we have made it easier than it was previously for small businesses to assert their rights. The second aspect to the new path, however, is the positive incentives and the new instruments, for example, the naming of customers with good payment practices, more information provided to small businesses concerning their rights, payment in instalments and the promotion of alternative dispute resolution mechanisms. This legislation is also part of the ‘better regulation’ approach and it will also apply to the EU institutions. We are particularly proud of this, because – as I am sure you can imagine – not everyone was enthusiastic about it. Of course, there were a few conflicts and I would like to mention some of these. Firstly, to start with, there were certainly major differences and a diversity of opinions in Parliament. The 100 amendments alone demonstrate that we first had to tussle together over this in Parliament, too. The Commission was certainly not always happy with our endeavours, including the extension of this to the business to business level, but I think that, overall, we have achieved a good result. It was the Council that posed the problems. It is regrettable that the Council has not always fulfilled its objective of helping small businesses. I find that particularly regrettable for the relatively rich and well-structured countries like Germany and Austria. With regard to the professional organisations, I can only say that they were constructive, even though we, naturally, did not always accept or were not always able to go with their opinions. In summary, the next steps are that, after tomorrow’s vote, we expect the Council to conduct a final positive vote and then the Member States will be able to implement this legislation. We do not expect it to take two years for this to be implemented. Instead, we expect the Member States to begin to transpose it into national law as early as January of next year. Barbara Weiler,  
rapporteur.

Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, when we discuss this matter back home in our electoral districts, I believe we will all find that we receive a great deal of support – something that is not a foregone conclusion where European dossiers are concerned – because this issue of late payment as a whole is not merely criticised back home; it is considered by everyone to be a given that payments should be made on time. That is the case irrespective of which party someone belongs to, and it is not dependent on what branch of industry you talk to, either. So we have broad agreement. I would also like to thank my fellow Members who have indicated their agreement with this result this evening. I would like to mention three more aspects. As I said at the beginning of the debate, we will set the wheels in motion tomorrow. However, we will have to look very closely at whether the relaxations that we have introduced for micro-businesses, for agricultural undertakings, for example, and for artisan companies, are actually sufficient to enable these enterprises to obtain the money they are owed. We will have to examine very carefully how the limited freedom of contract will work. That is something new in the European internal market that we are now going to try out and that all of us also more or less support. We will need to examine whether the 8% late payment interest rate is adequate; Parliament would have liked it to be 9%. We will see how it works, and I would like to ask the Commission to pay close attention in order to ensure that, during the process of implementation, the Member States do not water down the directive. I also see definite success on the horizon. I have heard that Spain has already produced new national legislation following our methods, and I know that the same is true of other Member States. In any case, our Committee will monitor the situation or carry out an impact assessment according to a directive, so that the Member States also know that, when the parliamentary term comes to an end, we will know who has implemented the improved payment practices as we intended and who has not. I would like to thank everyone who has contributed to this result, including the Belgian Presidency, which has perhaps not received enough recognition for its contribution. We know how efficiently and constructively you conducted the negotiations – a small country, but I would say a country with very intelligent and efficient methods for achieving results in Europe.

 Mr President, representatives of the Commission and, above all, the Council, ladies and gentlemen, we hear this every year in the debate on improvements in the implementation of the distribution of European funds: more accurate and more efficient control of expenditure in all bodies and institutions, more transparency for Parliament and also for citizens. The presence today of the Council is the first indication that something is changing in the Council as well. Marvellous, we are pleased – as you have heard – but that is certainly not enough for us. It is precisely the difference that you mentioned – you believe you have created complete transparency, while we believe you have not yet answered our questions from the debate at the end of November – that shows that we are not yet cooperating with each other as well as we should be. You spoke of the 1970 agreement that you want to amend and develop. That is all well and good, but this expectation of ours is hardly new. We have mentioned it a few times and now you have acted as if it were a new thing entirely. The Group of the Progressive Alliance of Socialists and Democrats will support Mr Czarnecki’s report. We share his criticism and that of the other groups. We will not grant discharge to the Council, either today or next month. I am therefore surprised by the request by Mrs Andreasen, since I obviously believe that the Member States are responsible for 80% of the funds. That does not exempt the Council from its responsibilities, since the Council is not a fourth or fifth institution in the EU, but works together with the Member States. However, our criticism, I agree, has no real consequences. As Mr Audy has pointed out, we must develop our tools. Every year, we show the Council the yellow card of discharge refusal and nothing happens. We must therefore develop our tools: not only tangible criticism, but also consequences – what happens if the Council does not work with us. That will possibly also mean constitutional change.

 Mr President, Commissioners, ladies and gentlemen, this joint debate this morning and the high quality of all three reports indicates the high priority given to internal market and consumer policy in Europe. I would like to thank all three rapporteurs and the many shadow rapporteurs and fellow Members who have produced this joint work. I would like to focus on two crucial points. The first is that we, that is, the Commission and those of us in this House, are assuming that everything runs relatively harmoniously in the internal market and that we have enlightened consumers and fair suppliers. That is often the case, but not always. There are irresponsible suppliers who only see their short-term profits and therefore, we need stronger market surveillance and supervision. However, there are also uninformed consumers. We need better information. It is not enough for the package leaflet to be readable. We need continuous information. Someone has just said that we need confidence. However, confidence comes from knowledge. I have heard that in Germany, only one in two 14 to 15 year olds understands the meaning of inflation. I do not even want to ask what the results of the questionnaire were when it came to the word ‘deflation’. We need schools to be better networked along with information on the conflict between the interests of suppliers and consumers. That is mentioned in the reports by my fellow Members ... (The President cut off the speaker) Barbara Weiler  (S&amp;D

 Mr President, Commissioner, Mr Caldeira, ladies and gentlemen, I would like to start by thanking Mr Caldeira and his team. His report will be very useful to us in our deliberations which lead up to the granting of a discharge. I have a sense of déjà vu, because as far as I can tell, the Council is once again conspicuous by its absence, just as it was last year. I am being so critical because the Council, as one of our major community institutions, cannot and should not stand outside this debate. We rightly expect all the Member States to provide control and transparency, but we also expect this from our own institutions and the Council is jointly responsible for what happens or does not happen in the Member States. Of course, the irregularities in the budgets do not affect the Council’s budget as severely as they do the agricultural sector, but nevertheless, we will also have questions about public procurement, late payments or overdue payments and repeated overestimating. We will be discussing this with the Council in the next few weeks. It is true that errors are not the same as fraud and that the recovery of payments is a useful tool. Another good tool is the process of naming and shaming in the area of agricultural policy which has proved its worth in Bavaria and in the rest of Germany. I believe that we should continue to use this method because it has become clear that the Member States and the companies involved react to it. We expect the Swedish Presidency to be ready to discuss this over the next few days and also… (The President cut off the speaker) Bernd Lange,

Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, what are we dealing with here? We are dealing with an issue which concerns fair trade. This is not about protectionism for European products. There is one issue, and one issue alone, at stake, namely ensuring that our trade relations are based on fairness. I therefore believe that the threat scenario that China is now creating is completely inappropriate. Let me make it very clear: we want transparency in the investigations, and we do not welcome attempts by China to obstruct these investigations by creating threat scenarios, in which European companies are put under pressure with the threat of countermeasures that are supposedly in the pipeline. No, that is not part of the discussion! We intend to investigate the matter. In reality, however, it is about the following issue. Under what kind of working conditions are the solar panels produced in China? Which direct and indirect subsidies go towards supporting their production? What about the value chain as a whole? There are many different aspects which need to be investigated very carefully.  There is undoubtedly overcapacity. We cannot have a situation in which dumping is used to reduce overcapacity, at the expense of European jobs and industry. That is why we need to achieve transparency here. Hence my question, and this is also addressed to the Commission: does this transparency exist on the Chinese side as well? Does the Commission have the opportunity to look at all of the relevant facts? That should have been China’s immediate reaction: instead of making threatening gestures, it should have created transparency. Secondly, are you willing to pursue this process to the end, even if China were to yield at the last moment? We do not want a situation like the ethanol case with the United States, when the procedure was shelved at the last minute! I urge you to pursue it right to the end. Bernd Lange,  
rapporteur for the opinion of the Committee on International Trade.

(DE) 
Mr President, Madam President-in-Office of the Council, I would like to begin by sincerely thanking the rapporteur for what is, in my view, an excellent report which covers the many different facets of our relations with Kazakhstan in a truly outstanding manner. Thank you very much indeed.  Speaking on behalf of the Committee on International Trade, I would like to talk about four aspects which are particularly important to us. First of all, as the President-in-Office of the Council has already mentioned, Kazakhstan is seeking accession to the WTO, and that means, of course, that it must comply with and implement WTO rules. It will also be subject to the WTO’s dispute settlement regime. This is an important step towards transparency and fairness.  Secondly, when we talk about transparency and fairness, raw materials are, of course, an issue of great relevance in this context. Kazakhstan’s economy is geared mainly towards the raw materials sector, so the main priority here is to create workable tax and financial frameworks, but without losing sight of the environmental dimension. The aim must be to ensure that raw materials extraction serves the interests of the people of Kazakhstan but also safeguards the interests of the environment. Thirdly, this includes the issue of phosphorus, for example. We cannot have a situation in which the export of phosphorus involves the use of dumping practices, ultimately putting a question mark over well-established structures in the European Union. We support trade, but it must take place under conditions which are fair and reasonable. Fourthly, as in all the trade agreements concluded by the EU, trade also means fair conditions of competition in the fields of workers’ rights and environmental standards. For that reason, we also need to include a sound and viable chapter on sustainable development in the agreement. We want this demand to be reflected in the resolution; that is our firm position. Bernd Lange  (S&amp;D
). 
 – (DE) 
Mr President, Commissioner, I think you are being too defensive if you only examine how the consequences of plant closures and overcapacity can be remedied. No, I believe we need to examine how corporate policy can be shaped in a sensible way. The lesson is firstly that we need different forms of corporate governance. We need employees to be more involved in their companies so that sensible solutions can be found for the future of firms. This is one of the central lessons learned from the crisis: greater worker participation in companies to enable sensible solutions to be found. Secondly, Commissioner, we in fact have 15 factories in the European Union that are running at around 50 % capacity. When I look at the global market, however, Commissioner, car production is growing from roughly 79 million to 84 million. Something is wrong here! It is unacceptable that we are de-industrialising here, while, on the other hand, the global automotive market is growing by 3 % a year. No, we do not need to just close down car factories, we need investments in future technologies to ensure that the automotive industry remains in Europe and is competitive on the global market. This also means that global corporations must be urged to exercise restraint, as they also make global investment decisions and do not necessarily place a particular emphasis on European interests. A more active role is therefore required from the European Commission! Bernd Lange,  
on behalf of the S&amp;D Group
. – (DE) 
Mr President, Commissioner, yes, we support you in your efforts to bolster the European steel industry. I also think it is right that trends that are also in evidence in the steel industry, namely simply reducing capacities, are not followed. Just recently I read an article in the press by the President of the European steel industry body that said that 100 000 of the close to 400 000 jobs in the industry would have to be cut, that we had to shed 25 % of capacity – a hard, deep cut. No, we cannot deal with the problem like this. We must make sure that we stabilise this core industry in the European Union and create prospects for development. This of course was a foundation stone on which the European Union was built. I would like to bring to mind the European Coal and Steel Community, which very successfully developed a research and structural policy for the steel sector. I believe that there should continue to be such a model; work on the further development of the European steel industry should involve three equally represented groups – the Commission, employers and employees.  What we really need are innovations to ensure we have highly flexible steel at our disposal, particularly for the energy transition, an area in which there is undoubtedly demand. We must also ensure that the steel industry can exist in a competitive environment and is not unduly burdened with costs. You therefore have our support to stabilise the European steel industry.

Madam President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, this agreement must indeed be scrutinised very carefully for it has major political implications. In Israel, there is a debate under way as to whether, with this agreement, we mean to support Israel or show it the red card. In my view, this is an unproductive debate. It is not for us to adopt a position on the State of Israel and its people. Our task is simply to adopt a position towards the present Israeli Government.  When we conclude agreements with other countries, it is only right and proper that we apply the standards and values that we uphold in the European Union to our partner countries as well. With that in mind, it must be said that the present Israeli Government, in its conduct towards the Occupied Territories and the people who live there, is not acting in accordance with the values to which the European Union is committed. That is why we cannot enter into an agreement with that government without giving the matter careful thought. Secondly, there is still a lack of clarity on a number of points. The previous speaker said that there was a consensus here. No, there is no consensus. The vote in committee was 13 to 15. In my view, the origin of generic drugs is an issue that must be clarified in future in order to ensure that they do not come from the Occupied Territories or from illegal settlements. We must also clarify how the Commission will in future exercise the right to extend this agreement to other products as well. That is why we need more time for a thorough-going discussion and why I fully support Véronique De Keyser’s demand for this matter to referred back to committee for intensive deliberation.

 Our values apply on an universal basis, of course. We make no distinction at all. Why you adopted the position you did two years ago is not something that I can explain. From our perspective, the situation is quite clear: we are not pulling arguments out of thin air. We want to ensure that the agreement, which will, after all, serve as a model for future agreements as well, is sound. That is the reason why we are asking for more time to discuss it, Mr Caspary.

 Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I move to defer the vote on the legislative declaration and to refer it back to committee, so that we can enter into trialogue. Bernd Lange,  
on behalf of the S&amp;D Group
. – (DE) 
Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, when negotiating the Economic Partnership Agreements (EPAs), we must always remember that we are entering the negotiations with different requirements. We have the European Union on one side with a strong Commissioner and a large team of officials, sitting across the negotiating table from young countries with little capacity. To this extent it is more than right and proper to allow these countries more time and opportunity for negotiations. We should not give the impression that we are putting pressure on these countries by abruptly ending market access opportunities. I also believe that we should not force anyone to sign something but rather that, in a spirit of partnership, we should negotiate solutions with these countries that are acceptable to both sides. Sometimes this requires a bit more time. That is why the Group of the Progressive Alliance of Socialists and Democrats in the European Parliament clearly supports the proposal from Mr Martin to give this two years, but no more than two years, in order to identify ways in which we can reach agreement. Mr Fjellner, I would ask you to support this compromise, because we have succeeded in obtaining a sizeable majority in committee in favour of sending clear signals that this should be brought to a close, while at the same time offering opportunities for negotiations. Bernd Lange,

Mr President, Commissioner, Mr Kariņš, I should like to start by extending the warmest of thanks to the rapporteur, Mr Kariņš, for his hard work and, above all, for his patience during negotiations. I would also like to thank you, Mr Oettinger, for your proposal. In general, you are doing your work really well in the area of energy policy. The object of my criticism, in other words the Council, is not here at present. Ladies and gentlemen, I have participated in around 50 conciliation procedures and trialogues, involving negotiations with the Council. However, in all this time, I have never witnessed anything like this before, namely that the Council has taken a heavy-handed position, seeking to blackmail Parliament by saying: take it or leave it. I have never known the Council’s chief negotiator to get up and leave a trialogue before. So, we have a contradiction to what we are constantly being told in the sermons from on high: we need more involvement from Europe. This morning we have once again discussed the fact that what we need in this crisis situation is more involvement from Europe and an agreement in relation to our core policies. Mr Oettinger, you have hit the nail on the head. Energy policy is central to the European Union, to economic growth and to a forward-looking energy policy. It is only logical, ladies and gentlemen, that we can only have a sound energy policy if we can also agree on a common external energy policy, in other words agreements with third countries. Accordingly, while I understand and sympathise with the idea that achieving the lowest standard is better than nothing, we must press for greater commitment in this legislative proposal. We want to make it mandatory for the Commission to be informed and we want the Commission to participate in negotiations. That is the least we need in order to ensure that a European external energy policy really is put into practice and that the Member States do not drag their feet as usual. We shall table these amendments tomorrow and hope that you will support them so that we can give the Council something more to work with. Commissioner, I am naturally hopeful that you are really serious about your last point, namely that there should be an examination of the Council’s behaviour in future, so that we can get a reasonable revision on track. Bernd Lange,

Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, thank you for attending this evening’s sitting, so that we can discuss this matter. This issue is clearly not of interest to everyone in plenary this evening. With these safeguard regulations we are still feeling our way somewhat in relation to the Treaty of Lisbon, because the roles of the various institutions and where certain things are regulated are still unclear. Thus we now have to incorporate a number of items in the legislation, by which I mean the ordinary legislation, that have already been included in the wording of the Treaty and in the Council’s decision, but which were in the wrong place. That is why it is good practice to take a closer look at the overall process of establishing this safety net for the agreement with Colombia and Peru. On the one hand, we are placing demands on Colombia and Peru in the agreement and now we must also see how we can define the requirements that we place on ourselves. It is also important that the safety net should remain practicable. It makes little sense to set down regulations that are never applied. This is how things were done in the past. For this reason, we should exercise the powers we have to dust down the safety net legislation so that we can apply it in a positive way. Commissioner, we are concerned about five points. The first is to see what the actual criteria are for casting a safety net. I am quite convinced that, in order to determine when something is having a detrimental effect on the market, we must also address the issue of social standards because, of course, the violation of social standards leads to dumping and can give rise to competitive advantages. Accordingly, this is one of the criteria for applying safety nets, particularly in the area of bananas. Now for my second point. If we are cautious in our approach to the Treaty of Lisbon, then we will naturally find ourselves being more and more cautious about the role of the European Parliament. It is fundamental for us that we, like all the other European institutions, should have the power to launch an investigation. My third point is that if we are serious about more transparency, then this also means that we must include civil society in our dialogue to a greater extent and that this should be institutionalised when we come to examine this agreement with Colombia and Peru. That is why I want to strengthen dialogue with civil society. We need more transparency. Commissioner, you always refer to the safeguard regulations with Korea as a template. The problem is that you have forgotten Article 11 of the agreement with Korea when it comes to the issue of the transparency of monitoring and reporting. I am referring to the requirement that a report must be presented that covers all the different angles, which is something we want to see guaranteed. The fifth issue relates to providing security for the banana producers in Europe’s regions. Bernd Lange,  
rapporteur
. – (DE) 
Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, we have a huge amount of work ahead of us in the coming three to four months. In accordance with Parliament’s decision, we are going to launch a road map for strengthening workers’ rights, human rights and environmental conditions in Colombia and Peru, while also establishing a safety net for conditions here in the European Union. Neither of these is an easy task. Hence my urgent call on you, Commissioner, to support this work in whatever way you can, particularly with regard to the road map and the involvement of the government in Peru, in order to ensure that we establish a road map for Colombia and Peru within a reasonable timeframe. I get the feeling that the message has not been fully understood there and that people are unaware of just how serious Parliament is about its conditions. Secondly, Commissioner, I would ask you to please take an active mediator role in relation to the Council in the trialogue on the safeguards, so that we can also implement the safeguard regulations in a reasonable timeframe to ensure that we have both the road map and safeguard regulation in place in good time to enable us to vote on this in November and finally put this matter to bed, in the interests of the people of Europe and the people of Colombia and Peru.

 Madam President, Mr De Gucht, ladies and gentlemen, this is a political issue on which we have to decide. We in the Group of the Progressive Alliance of Socialists and Democrats in the European Parliament have analysed the Anti-Counterfeiting Trade Agreement (ACTA) very closely and carefully, and we would like to make it clear that ACTA is not a suitable instrument for guaranteeing copyright protection and preventing counterfeiting. ACTA is the wrong instrument for this and, therefore, we in the S&amp;D Group will be voting against it. Why is that? For three reasons. Firstly, the countries which are mainly responsible for counterfeiting and disregarding copyright are not the subject of the agreement. The good have been sorted out from the bad and, in international terms, it makes absolutely no sense. Secondly, ladies and gentlemen, rules from the analogue area of counterfeiting have been transferred into the digital world and, as a result, the wrong rules are being imposed on consumers who behave differently in a digital environment. This is why we are saying that we cannot put apples and pears into a saucepan and finish up with apple sauce. The wrong things are being combined here and that is the second reason why we are opposed to ACTA. However, ladies and gentlemen, the most important reason is the third one. ACTA is putting the digital world into a straitjacket and we do not even know whether we want it, because the question of enforcing intellectual property rights on the Internet, in the digital environment, has not even been resolved within the European Union. The Commission’s presentation of its legislative proposal is overdue. How can we conclude an international agreement in this area if we have not even discussed the legislative proposal within the European Union and drafted some sensible legislation? Therefore, let us put ACTA to one side and, first of all, draw up a sensible European law. I call on the Commission to submit a legislative proposal for the European Union.

Blue-card answer.

You are mixing up apples and pears again. Climate policy is obviously something quite different from the question of copyright protection. You know very well that 60% of all counterfeit products come from China and this is why it is genuinely necessary for the international community to enter into a dialogue with China in order to find a solution and not simply to sort out the good countries from the bad ones, Mr Fjellner. Bernd Lange,  
on behalf of the S&amp;D Group.
 – (DE)
 Mr President, Commissioner, and of course – at least virtually – President-in-Office of the Council, our resolution is essentially directed towards the Council, as the reality is that we believe – and this touches on Mr Leichtfried’s question – that we, as Parliament, should proffer our position on the issuing of a mandate before one is issued. There is a good reason for this. You have already addressed the resolutions that we have adopted with numerous questions. These resolutions did show quite clearly the two sides of the coin when it comes to trade relations with Japan. We support increased trade relations with Japan – that much is clear – as the negotiations at WTO level have ground to a halt and Japan is one of our most important trading partners in the world. Over the last year, EU exports to Japan had a total value of around EUR 49 billion, while exports from Japan to the EU came in at around EUR 69 billion – in other words, we are talking about a very important part of our economic dynamics. That being the case, we need to also strengthen this so that the inter-exchange and the growth dynamic develop further. That is right and proper. On the other side of the coin, however, when it comes to market access on the Japanese side, we actually have non-tariff barriers to trade. That, after all, is why the Commission carried out this scoping exercise, and it was only recently that we obtained the results. Once again, analysing this situation precisely is the right thing to do. No sooner do we look, for example, at the key sector that is the motor industry, than three non-tariff barriers to trade hit us right in the face. Of course there is, for one thing, an agreement at UN level about technical standards for cars, as well as for vehicle parts. Clearly, recognition of this is crucial to market access. The European Union has signed up to nearly all of these guidelines, whereas Japan has only signed up to 43. In order to also be able to supply car parts to the Japanese market with unfettered access, it is actually a basic prerequisite that Japan, too, should sign up to these UN conventions. If I consider, now, the tax breaks enjoyed by environmentally friendly vehicles, I can see that, in Japan, these depend solely on test cycle JC08. Logic dictates, however, that this cycle is not adhered to by vehicles that we produce here, as we test according to a different cycle, the European driving cycle. It needs to be ensured that the same tax benefits for environmentally friendly vehicles – we define these as vehicles emitting below 90 grams of CO2
 per kilometre – are ensured for European vehicles in Japan, too, without jeopardising the standard by so doing. Of course, traders must also have the opportunity to offer their cars for sale in Japan, and to have them maintained in workshops there. Current property law does not provide for that. So, then, we need a tougher re-presentation of the scoping exercise and clear guidelines from Parliament. That is why we are calling on the Council to wait until September to issue a mandate, that is, until Parliament has drawn up clear guidelines for a mandate for trade relations with Japan. Bernd Lange,

 Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, I, too, would like to thank the rapporteur, Mr Fjellner, and also the shadow rapporteur, Mr Martin, and the other shadow rapporteurs. They really have succeeded in negotiating a good compromise. I also call for us to pass this compromise with the largest possible majority, as there has been real success here in granting these unilateral advantages in a more targeted way. The EU’s trade policy, after all, is oft-criticised. In this area, however, it is clear that we are granting unilateral advantages to the poorest and next-to-poorest countries in the world, so that they can bolster their development on the back of these advantages. We will now be making this more targeted, and that is exactly the right approach to take. With the GSP+ countries, we are inviting them – on the basis of common values in relation to human rights and sustainability – to intensify trade relations with us still further. This also helps to strengthen sustainable development on the global level. Here too, then, what we have is a reasonable approach. We have also ensured, however, that there are not sudden distortions in our industrial relations. In that connection, we have incorporated appropriate safety nets in those areas in which there is a competitive environment for our industrial products, so that we can very confidently say that we are granting unilateral advantages without jeopardising any jobs within the European Union. For those countries that will be leaving the GSP scheme, it goes without saying that the door is not closed. We invite all of them to conclude intensive trade relations with us – be it via bilateral trade negotiations, through the WTO, or through economic partnership agreements (EPAs) – with the aim of bringing about sustainable development.

 Mr President, Mr De Gucht, I believe it is clear that trade is not an end in itself but a means of improving people’s living conditions. A glance at the situation in Colombia and Peru shows that the process of improving living conditions there involves major challenges. Against this background, Parliament is, of course, investigating very carefully, on the basis of the rights granted to it under the Treaty of Lisbon, whether this trade agreement with Colombia and Peru meets these requirements. It is very unlikely that the trade agreement alone will be able to overcome these challenges. The issues include the extent to which civil society is included in the process of implementing the trade agreement, the independence of its involvement and the options for instigating complaint procedures. There is also the question of the restrictions placed on efforts to implement the sustainability chapter. Article 267 and Article 277 specify the possible restrictions relating to material resources. We believe it is necessary for us to enter into additional agreements with the Colombian and the Peruvian governments so that we can be certain that the trade agreement will bring about significant improvements in the living conditions of the people. One aspect of this involves improving the employment rights of people who are working in the informal sector. Around 58% of people in Colombia, for example, are employed in the informal sector and their working conditions are quite different from those of people with formal jobs. The question of how the interests of workers are represented must be reconsidered, in particular, in the light of International Labour Organisation (ILO) Conventions 129 and 135. Job security and social dialogue also need to be improved in line with ILO Convention 144. The United States and Switzerland have put in place action plans to accompany their free trade agreements and we should follow their example. Bernd Lange  (S&amp;D

 Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, you will have noticed from Mr Lambsdorff’s remarks that the issue here is not an objective debate, but rather the elections in Germany. All I can say here is that for a party on the political defensive, a debate like this, with so many wrong-headed arguments, may be one way to stay afloat. However this is to ignore the facts. The situation in Germany is that the government supported by Mr Lambsdorff’s party already levies a tax rate on diesel above the future minimum tax rate. At present, we have a minimum tax rate of EUR 0.33 in Germany, which would be increased to EUR 0.41; however, the German Government already takes EUR 0.47. In other words, there would be no immediate change. Thus, it is wrong to say that the price of diesel fuel will sky-rocket in the morning. The second point is proportionality. We Social Democrats have always said that proportionality is not unconditional. We have tabled Amendment 15 precisely with this in mind. We must not drive the diesel engine to extinction through taxation. We Social Democrats proposed this amendment, which the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs was happy to adopt. But what happens next? Obviously our Liberal and Conservative colleagues distrust their own governments because the definition of the absolute tax rate is still a matter for the Member States and their governments. The level of distrust is so great that they believe that if this resolution is adopted, the governments they support will increase diesel taxes. That is why I can understand it when people say that this distrust will result in the rejection of proportionality. If your distrust really is so great, then I believe it is right to reject proportionality in this case. I have one final word to add. If everyone is suddenly a supporter of diesel, then I find myself wondering why these governments are not moving to switch from taxing cars to taxing CO2
 emissions, benefiting the more economical diesel engine. You can do this immediately without consulting Europe. What is stopping you? Bernd Lange  (S&amp;D

Mr Seeber, I have a supplementary question. Are you unaware that we Social Democrats tabled an amendment in the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs drawing attention to precisely this problem – namely, that this could lead to problems with industrial policy and the questioning of the CO2
 reduction strategy for cars – and that this amendment was adopted by the Economic Affairs Committee? Bernd Lange  (S&amp;D

 Mr President, Mr Mato Adrover, I see things in a fundamentally different way. This agreement cannot be compared with the fisheries agreement. In the case of the fisheries agreement, it was not clear where the money paid by the European Union would be going. In this case we have clear rules about who benefits from the money – and the beneficiaries really are Moroccan producers – as well as about European investments into Morocco. With that being the case, the situation is completely different. It is also completely clear that, with this agreement, we are not legitimising the situation in Western Sahara. On the contrary, we are saying clearly that a solution needs to be found in the interests of the people. We are also making that clear with our resolution. We cannot, however, send out a signal to the Arab Spring that we will always seal off our markets per se. We do need to offer solutions for fair trade so that there really can be change through trade. It also means that, if there really are distortions in the European Union in agriculture, we need to ensure, within the EU, that our farmers also have development perspectives. We cannot simply close our borders, however. That would be a signal that would heighten the sense of disappointment in the Arab Spring. For these reasons I will recommend to Members in my group that they vote in favour of this agreement. Bernd Lange,  
rapporteur for the opinion of the Committee on International Trade

 Mr President, Mr Bütikofer, I too wish to start by expressing my thanks for this ambitious report and the huge amount of work it has entailed. Mr Tajani, raw materials policy is essential to the development of European industry. The trade dimension is decisive, which is why I believe it is right for raw materials policy to be anchored in an international context from the perspective of industrial policy in Europe. A number of points are key here: If we intend to secure our supply of raw materials in the world by means of partnership agreements, we can only do this by ensuring that the businesses that extract these raw materials also conduct themselves in a reasonable way. It is unacceptable for European businesses to evade tax or for workers to be required to work under inhuman conditions. That is why it is clear that if we intend to mine raw materials, then businesses need to comply with clear social and environmental standards. Secondly, we must also ensure that the raw materials that we use do not come from crisis regions and are not used to finance groups who use the money earned from raw materials to fund civil war. We need an international certification system for the extraction of raw materials and for tracing trade, so that we can tell where raw materials come from. By the way, excellent footprints can be found for raw materials everywhere. Thirdly, we must ensure that we do not export raw materials illegally. In our own interests, we need to close any loopholes in our legislation – this last remark is addressed to Mr Florenz. However, we also need to improve controls. The system will never work if a single individual is to be required to ensure controls in a large European port. Exports need closer monitoring and it is necessary to ensure that monopolistic and oligopolistic structures in raw materials trade are eliminated. The good news, Commissioner, is that the Commission is moving in the right direction. Bernd Lange  (S&amp;D
).

 Mr President, Commissioner, we all firmly believe that we must help the people in Pakistan, but the instrument that you are proposing, Commissioner, is the wrong one, for three reasons. The first is that there is absolutely no proof that trade facilitation will benefit the people affected by the floods. On the contrary, we can even see that the textile industry in Pakistan is based in other regions and, in recent years, has even experienced growth. Thus, this sector is not really affected at all. How we intend to help the people affected by the floods by means of trade facilitation is beyond me. Secondly, I cannot understand how we can now grant these facilitations to a country that plainly does not meet the GSP+ conditions in terms of social and environmental standards and send a signal to other countries, like Bangladesh, which do meet these conditions, that essentially tells them that their efforts are not wanted and it is also possible to achieve this status by other means. My third argument, Commissioner, is that this is not an approach based on solidarity, because the burden in Europe is borne in a one-sided manner by certain sectors and certain countries only. If we want to do something, then we should do so in a spirit of solidarity with all countries and with the involvement of everyone, and that means we need direct aid for the flood victims. That would be the right approach to take. Bernd Lange  (S&amp;D
).

 Madam President, Commissioner, I really do think it is important that, following the entry into force of the Treaty of Lisbon, we decide on the structure of the negotiations together, because this Treaty gives Parliament a new role in trade relations. If we once again consider the fact that India is clearly a market of the future, we must also feed this back into a clear position adopted by Parliament: In our view, industrial development in the European Union – linked to jobs – is of key importance. We therefore need to make it clear that the interests of jobs in industry in Europe must take priority in the trade agreements. For that reason, although an agreement has to be asymmetrical, at the end of the day, the tariffs must be zero. It is not acceptable for us to have tariffs of 100% in mechanical engineering and the automotive sector and, in the end, perhaps negotiate 50%. As long as we do not have any zero tariffs, it will encourage investments outside Europe. Therefore, Commissioner, we need to clearly define our priority areas and they lie in industry. We also need a level playing field to be established with regard to social standards, and it is also necessary for clear obligations to be imposed on India in relation to workers’ rights. Bernd Lange  (S&amp;D

Madam President, I am somewhat disappointed that Parliament was unable to approve this by a majority today in order to learn sensible lessons from the reactor disaster in Japan. I consider it beyond question that this must mean organising a clear shift in energy policy away from nuclear energy – in order words, the beginning of a phase-out – at European level. Secondly, it should also be obvious that if we carry out stress tests, then any nuclear power plant that fails these tests is required to be removed from the grid. Neither of these proposals received a majority in the vote. I was therefore unable to support the resolution. I hope that we will soon succeed in organising a uniform energy policy that provides us with safe and sensible energy in the future, which means movement towards energy efficiency and renewable energies.

 Madam President, Mr Tajani, ladies and gentlemen, this report presents the position of the European Parliament very clearly. I would like thank the shadow rapporteurs who have contributed to the report and the rapporteurs for the opinion of the relevant committees. Together, we have succeeded in conveying a clear message, Mr Tajani, which is that we want to move industrial policy closer to the centre of the political arena, for good reason. Industrial policy will help us, firstly, to create good quality, future-proof jobs in Europe and, secondly, to secure investment in Europe. Our competitors all over the world are making good use of industrial policy, for example, in the United States, China, Brazil and India. Thirdly, we are faced with challenges relating to sustainability, both in terms of the climate and the economic and social foundations of our society. Against this background, it is important for us to put industrial policy at the centre of the political arena. On the one hand, this means that we expect industrial policy to be integrated in such a way, Mr Tajani, that it becomes the focal point of legislative initiatives within the European Union. We do not want to see environmental, trade and competition policies being drawn up first and only subsequently being coordinated with the interests of European industry. On the contrary, we must define the other areas of policy on the basis of the strategic interests of a sustainable industrial policy. Secondly, Mr Tajani, we need better coordination between the industrial policies in the different Member States. Therefore, I would like to ask you, and we have included this in the report, to make use of Article 173(2) of the Treaty of Lisbon, in order to coordinate industrial policy in the Member States more effectively, so that we really are all moving in the same direction. We must, of course, focus on a number of specific areas. On the horizontal level, we need to look, in particular, at innovation policy throughout the entire value-added chain. We must succeed in supporting the entire economic chain, from fundamental research through to the market launch of products, and in bringing the best solutions for our society onto the market. We also need to pay more attention to resources. Simply saying that this is important is not enough. We need to introduce practical legislation which will significantly increase resource productivity. In industry, labour is responsible for 20% of costs and resources for 40%. That is a starting point for action on raw materials. The mobile phones that we all use contain rare earths and metals, which are seldom recycled. The recycling rate for mobile phones is only 1.5%. That is a starting point for creating jobs and increasing the competitiveness of European industry. I would like to make one last point in this context. Innovation and resource productivity will not happen by themselves. They depend on the employees who are involved. For this reason, a sensible industrial policy must also take into consideration the skills and the involvement of employees. If we can bring this about, then I am confident that we will have future-proof jobs in European industry. Bernd Lange,  
rapporteur.

 Madam President, Mr Tajani, ladies and gentlemen, thank you very much for your many inspiring contributions. Mr Tajani, the four key messages which bring us together are clear. Firstly, we want to ensure that industrial policy lies at the heart of EU policy. Secondly, we want to link together sustainability and competitiveness and develop them further. Thirdly, we must not take a dogmatic approach, because this area cannot be regulated by the market alone or by the state alone. We need practical, sensible measures. Fourthly, this is just the beginning and not the end of the discussion on modernising industrial policy in the European Union. We are extending a hand to you, Mr Tajani, but we are also aware that we must take you at your word. We are expecting concrete legislative proposals and also concrete measures to provide financial support, particularly in the field of research. Mr Tajani, if we are successful, and if the hand that we are extending to you and the statement that you have made are compatible, perhaps we will find ourselves in a situation similar to that at the end of the wonderful film ‘Casablanca’, when Humphrey Bogart says to the police captain: ‘I think this is the beginning of a beautiful friendship!’ Bernd Lange,

 Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, the Treaty of Lisbon has in fact put trade policy on a new footing. The EU is solely responsible for trade policy and Parliament gives or withholds its consent. In that respect, we have gained a new responsibility. We can only enable this new responsibility to take shape if we act together. We have proven that very clearly in this matter. In this regard, I would also like to thank the rapporteurs and shadow rapporteurs. Trade policy is not an end in itself. Its purpose is, firstly, to strengthen jobs and industrial development in the European Union and, secondly, to improve conditions for people in other countries of the world. The aim of trade policy must be to achieve both of these goals. We therefore need to assess this agreement from this viewpoint. Overall, this is a step in the right direction towards fulfilling these two requirements. However, we certainly do have a few points of criticism, for example the question of duty drawback in South Korea, which will bring one-sided competitive advantages for certain sectors of industry in South Korea, particularly in sensitive areas such as the automotive industry. It was therefore right for us to have very intensive talks about a safeguard clause and also to have jointly implemented such a clause, which provides for the close monitoring of precisely these points, so that we can be certain that the possibilities provided by duty drawback in South Korea do not lead to a distortion of competition in Europe. Parliament has rightly established safeguards here. Secondly, this agreement also has the purpose of improving the situation in South Korea for our colleagues there. South Korea still has improvements to make with regard to Chapter 13, in particular the question of the core labour standards laid down by the ILO. Two absolutely crucial core labour standards – No 87 and No 98, relating to collective bargaining – have not be implemented or ratified. Section 314 of the penal code relates to the obstruction of business. Neither of these things is in line with the nature and the provisions of this agreement. Thus, Commissioner, I am relying on you, and on the statement that you have given in support of the safeguard clause, to change this situation in South Korea so that this agreement will represent a blueprint for the future to enable globalisation to proceed in a fair manner. Bernd Lange,

 Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, I would first like to add my thanks to the rapporteur for the good cooperation that has helped Parliament unanimously adopt an extremely fundamental position in Committee – which is very much to be welcomed – and which has once again made clear the significance of this safeguard regulation. Together with the agreement with South Korea, this is the first agreement that we have negotiated following the entry into force of the Treaty of Lisbon, which gave Parliament a new role that it must play. Secondly, this Free Trade Agreement with South Korea and the safeguard regulation are also something of a blueprint for future agreements, and to this extent, we must tread particularly carefully here. These are two important reasons why we should not nonchalantly adopt diluted positions, but should really fight for prudent regulations to be adopted. As you are aware, Commissioner, there are six points that we are particularly concerned about here. I would like to give a brief recap of what these are. Firstly, the duty drawback mechanism. If Korean manufacturers use parts from third countries when manufacturing their goods, they do not have to pay duty on these and can export them to Europe, while European manufacturers – even if they use the same parts – do not enjoy this exemption from duty. This therefore provides Korean manufacturers with a competitive advantage. This must be closely monitored to see whether it gives rise to distortion of the market. That cannot be achieved by means of a simple declaration; rather, it must be made legally binding by including it in the safeguard regulation as a basis for initiating investigations. Secondly, there will also be regional variation. The sensitive sectors are not all represented equally strongly in all the Member States. Consequently, we must pay particular attention to how sensitive sectors in individual regions can be protected from targeted assaults. That is no simple task, because we are in an internal market – but a political solution must be found. Thirdly, as this is the first agreement since the Treaty of Lisbon, Commissioner, it also involves a new balance between the Council and Parliament; and since we have also reached agreement with the Commission, it is only right that an equal role for Parliament and the Council is anchored in the agreement. Fourthly, the implementation processes are, of course, your business – we have no desire to interfere with the operational implementation – but as Parliament we must ensure that Parliament’s rights are not brought into question in the comitology procedure. In particular, we need a right of withdrawal – this, too, must be ensured. My fifth point is that many decades of experience with South Korea has shown us that in addition to tariff trade policy, non-tariff barriers to trade are constantly being constructed. We must therefore also have a clear mechanism for monitoring, reporting and initiating consultations should problems arise in the area of non-tariff barriers to trade. My sixth point is that if we are serious about this new kind of trade agreement, then we must also involve and strengthen civil society. This means that fundamental ILO standards – such as standard 87, which grants workers the right to strike – need to be firmly rooted and implemented. In contrast, Article 314 of South Korea’s penal code states that ‘Interfering with the smooth running of the business’ is a criminal offence. We need to do something about this – civil society must be strengthened, fundamental ILO standards and fundamental environmental standards must be ensured, and civil society must also be involved in the monitoring of the agreement in the form of the Domestic Advisory Groups. My final point, Commissioner, is that you said that provisional application will most likely occur once agreement has been reached. I would like to delete this ‘most likely’. Provisional application cannot take place until Parliament has reached a decision on this matter! (Applause) Bernd Lange  (S&amp;D
).

Mr President, President-in-Office of the Council, Commissioner, I, too, would like to thank the Spanish Presidency and also the Commission for bringing the subject of electromobility to the fore. I also believe that we can use electromobility to revitalise the mobility economy in Europe, and we need to do that in order to create value and to safeguard jobs. However – to use another metaphor – we need to step on the accelerator, because the issue of electromobility affects many policy areas. There is, of course, the issue of standardisation, technology, but also the question of the integration of electromobility into the whole transport system, because we may need new forms of mobility, particularly in urban areas. Energy must be renewable and we need raw materials, so trade is also affected. Therefore, I would ask you, Commissioner, to perhaps integrate electromobility further in the follow-on from Cars 21. Bernd Lange  (S&amp;D
). 
 – (DE)
 Mr President, in the opinion of the Committee on Industry, Research and Energy, it is, of course, also important to protect small and medium-sized enterprises. Commissioner, competition is not an end in itself. If we look at the situation of small dealerships and small workshops, we need to increase their economic ability to act, otherwise one day we will only have large dealerships and large workshop chains. This includes, firstly, genuine authorisation for multi-branding. It includes allowing workshops and dealerships to have unrestricted access to information on vehicles and repair options. Thirdly, it includes providing the necessary opportunities for gaining qualifications. We talked earlier about electromobility. They also need to be in a position to maintain electric cars. Fourthly, they need investment security, in other words contractual protection and no more revisions. They need to be able to make safe investments over a long period. Bernd Lange,

 Mr President, Commissioner, I have three questions on my mind. The first is, why are we still lacking transparency when the Treaty of Lisbon has been in force since 1 December and we have had an interinstitutional agreement with the Commission since 10 February? I cannot understand why it is still the case that the Council is sitting at the table as an observer in the negotiations, Parliament is not involved and the documents are not publicly accessible. So why is this, Commissioner? The second question that is of concern to me is this: who is actually negotiating the ACTA Agreement? This is not being negotiated as some sort of follow-up agreement to TRIPS within the framework of the World Trade Organisation. It is only being negotiated by individual States and – as we hear from the United States – also by powerful economic interests. I ask myself whether, in fact, standards are not being set which will ultimately apply to everyone even though not everyone is sitting round the negotiating table. The third question that is troubling me, Commissioner, is this: what actually is the substance of the negotiations? In your hearing, you answered my question and assured me that the acquis communautaire
 was secure. However, when I look at individual papers that have leaked out I unfortunately have my doubts about this. I understand that negotiations are being held, that blocks on the Internet are possible, that providers are to be used, so to speak, to help police the Internet for economic interests, that restrictions on research and science may sometimes be imposed and that some people are even trying to introduce general surveillance systems. I therefore ask myself, where in all this is the acquis communautaire
? There is also the question of compensation. The fact that the inclusion of lost profit in the compensation is being negotiated is not appropriate for our policy. Of course, my third question, Commissioner, is what is the actual relationship between online and offline? When I read that online and offline are both supposed to represent the digital world, does that essentially mean that there are also to be restrictions and searches of laptops, iPods and MP3 players at borders? Would you please provide answers to these three questions. Bernd Lange  (S&amp;D
). 
 – (DE)
 Mr President, Commissioner, we all know that GSP is a good system and that GSP+ is a very good system. We also need to ensure their extension and so we need your proposal so that we can have a proper debate in Parliament. So, Commissioner, please speed things up. Even for GSP+, we may be able to introduce a few improvements. In this regard, there are five points that I would like to make concerning areas where we may be able to make further improvements. Firstly, who determines how the 27 standards are actually implemented, not only recognised in practice, but formally implemented? Is that the task of the ILO alone, or do we not need an assessment committee to provide specific support during implementation? Secondly, how are we involving civil society? I would like to see the coordination of civil society in the country in question in the assessment of the implementation of GSP+, just as we have now agreed in the agreement with South Korea. Thirdly, who actually initiates an investigation if any problems are detected? Parliament needs to be involved here, because I have the feeling that, in the Council, interests other than actually having an investigation carried out come into play. Parliament should also initiate an investigation in this connection. We surely also need clear structures for the next steps that we are to take as well as clearer structures for withdrawal, but perhaps we can talk about this in detail another time. Bernd Lange  (S&amp;D
). 
 – (DE)
 Mr President, Mr De Gucht, I have three questions for you. My first question concerns the need for fair competition conditions. The fact that employees’ rights in South Korea are restricted means that there are unfair competitive conditions, which include the question of collective action. Paragraph 314 of the South Korean Criminal Code refers to the crime of ‘disrupting operations’. This is used to prevent strikes and to limit the rights of trade unions, for example, in the case of Ssangyong. I would also like to know why we are concluding free trade agreements with countries such as South Korea and Colombia which have the most problems with the standards of the International Labour Organisation. Therefore, my first question is this: How do you propose to use the free trade agreement to ensure that there are no unfair competition conditions in South Korea caused by restrictions on employees’ rights? My second question relates to the problems in the car industry, which several other speakers have also referred to. It is very important in this case that there are sensible safeguard clauses. General safeguard clauses are currently in place for major market disruptions and for the duty drawback system. I am not able to understand this fully. Mr De Gucht, perhaps you could explain the safeguard clauses to me in simple terms. I would particularly like to know who can trigger them and when. My third question concerns the new contractual basis for our cooperation introduced by the Treaty of Lisbon. This includes approving safeguard clauses and implementation as part of the codecision process. Can you guarantee that the free trade agreement will not be put into force until Parliament has approved this procedure and only after Parliament has exercised its rights and adopted the safeguard clauses? Bernhard Rapkay,  
rapporteur.
 – (DE)
 Mr President, I would like to just briefly explain the motion to postpone the debate. As you know, we held a number of rounds of negotiations with the Council about the unitary patent quite some time ago, and we reached a joint result at the end of November last year. The package consists of three parts: the patent regulation itself via the codecision procedure, the implementing regulation via the consultation procedure and a third area, consisting of an intergovernmental agreement. We reached an agreed result and, on 2 December last year, the chair of the Committee on Legal Affairs, Mr Lehne, received a letter from the Presidency of the Council containing the agreed text and a covering letter in which the Council committed to adopt exactly the enclosed text if Parliament adopted exactly what we had negotiated and agreed as well. For seven months, nothing has happened, as the Council has failed to get its act together on another matter, namely, the issue of where the seat of the central division of the patent court should be. This issue is not within our competence, however, and accordingly we have not got involved. There were three interested parties in this dispute, and in the last week the Council has decided, in its wisdom – something about which we are all aware – that all three interested parties will be getting the nod. That is not the crucial point, however, for which reason there is clearly cause to wonder whether what we have here is something of an oriental bazaar, but that would be an unfair insult to the serious traders of oriental bazaars. The problem is that it was also agreed to interfere in Parliament’s competences and to delete something from the regulation itself, specifically, three key articles. Coreper will be meeting tomorrow morning at 09.00 and formalising what the Heads of State or Government have agreed. It plans to then present us with that new text at 10.30 so that we can hold a debate on the basis of the new text in the afternoon, followed by a vote on Wednesday. This is a blatant violation of our agreement, and I believe that this is the first time this has happened in the history of our negotiations, informal trialogues, with the Council. This is not acceptable, Mr President, and that is why we are requesting that the item be taken off the agenda. (Applause)
 We are moving to have the item taken off the agenda as we cannot allow what I have just outlined to happen. Should Coreper decide tomorrow to adopt what is before me now, we will still have to discuss how we can move forward with this dossier all in all. Mr President, in order to avoid any interested parties getting the wrong impression, however, I want to make it clear that this is not just about this procedural issue, it is about a fundamental content-related issue. In many people’s view – including that of the Council in the negotiations themselves in the course of the last year – the removal of the three articles that has now been decided on is a blatant violation of European law. It is important to be aware of this. They want a regulation and a regulation should regulate something. They want to take out the regulatory content, in other words, exactly the things that are supposed to be regulated. That is remarkable in itself and it is why we have to take this item off the agenda at all events. Bernhard Rapkay,  
rapporteur
. – (DE)
 Mr President, I would just like to say one thing regarding the debate previously mentioned on the immunity of Mr de Magistris, as I am also rapporteur in that case. I would like to point out that no debate on this has been included in the agenda, only a vote. I would also like to point that there are proceedings being brought against Mr de Magistris on a total of five accounts. This is only about one of these that is relatively uncontroversial. As regards the other accounts, we will first hear what Mr de Magistris has to say. Bernhard Rapkay,  
rapporteur
. – (DE)
 Mr President, I just wanted to clarify that, because some Members asked about it earlier. With regard to the defence of the parliamentary immunity of Viktor Uspaskich I have to say that this is not in fact what it is about. Mr Uspaskich does not have parliamentary immunity. Parliament waived Mr Uspaskich’s parliamentary immunity on 7 September 2010 – in other words, more than a year ago – and that situation has not changed. On the contrary, Mr Uspaskich has asked for his immunity to be reinstated on the basis of new information that he claims to have. What is the issue here? Mr Uspaskich is accused by the Lithuanian law enforcement authorities of having contravened party law and tax law in Lithuania during the period from 2004 to 2006 when he was chair of his party. He was not a Member of this House between 2004 and 2006. He was, however, a member of the Seimas (the Lithuanian Parliament). In 2008, the Seimas waived his immunity. He was then elected to the European Parliament in 2009, where he obviously received immunity once again. Then we had to deal with the matter. He was heard in Parliament twice. I want to make this point, because he always claims that he had no opportunity to present his case. He had two hearings in committee. I do not know whether Mr Uspaskich is guilty or whether he is innocent. He always maintains that he is innocent. I do not know. However, it is not my job, nor is it your job, to decide. It is the job of the judicial authorities in the Member State of Lithuania to decide. We simply have to determine whether two particular aspects to this case are such that his immunity, which he naturally has as a Member of the European Parliament, should be retained and that he should be subject to a different procedure to that of any normal citizen of his country. We have come to the conclusion that this is not the case. One aspect relates to the question of whether, through such proceedings, he is prevented from expressing his free political opinion as an MEP – but contravention of tax legislation actually has nothing to do with freedom of expression. The second aspect relates to the fact that, as a result of these proceedings, he is persecuted to a certain extent in his political activities. That is something that gives cause for consideration. However, after careful deliberation – following two hearings and after questioning the Lithuanian authorities once again – we reached the conclusion that this was not the case either. Thus, there was nothing else that we could do except waive his immunity. Mr Uspaskich then went to the Court of Justice of the European Union – as he is entitled to do – to the General Court, and brought an action for the annulment of our decision and for the suspension of the decision until the hearing for the main case. Of course, the Court of Justice of the European Union accepted this, but it rejected the application for a temporary order. Mr Uspaskich then declared that he had new information. Apparently, in WikiLeaks facts were published that confirm his position, and he is therefore asking for the case to be considered once again. He also said that he would withdraw his application to the court. I advised him most strongly against doing that. This is the only route that will enable him to obtain his right in court. I strongly advised him not to do it, but he nevertheless withdrew his appeal to the court. We then discussed the new facts in another hearing and came to the conclusion that these new facts may perhaps be relevant to the proceedings themselves in Lithuania, but not to the decision concerning the waiving of his immunity. We discussed the matter in detail, debating it for and against in several sittings, and we came to the firm conclusion that there is no other option: as we are not deciding on guilt or innocence here, but only on whether he has privileged access, we have to conclude that neither the first point, regarding ‘the free expression of his political opinion’, nor the second point, namely ‘political persecution’ are relevant here. There therefore remains nothing else for us to do but to maintain his immunity waiver. We are not making a decision to withdraw his immunity because it has already been withdrawn. Thus, in the report we conclude that his immunity should remain withdrawn. Bernhard Rapkay,

 Mr President, I am, of course, also speaking as rapporteur, because I have been involved with this matter for a long time. I have not done this for the pleasure of it, nor was I particularly keen on doing it. However, what we have just heard is not proof that the majority in committee were wrong the first time and again the second time. Nothing – absolutely nothing – has been put forward that indicates that. I am not making a judgment with regard to the role that Mr Uspaskich plays in politics in Lithuania. That is not my job. It is not your job, either. This issue here is: is he getting a fair trial or not? You will have to prove to me that he is not getting a fair trial. This proof has not been provided. Mr Tomaševski, please refrain from making comments about Bolshevists and similar things. That has more of an effect of disqualifying you rather than helping to establish the truth. Just to make it clear once again: the issue here is not for us to say whether he is guilty or not guilty. It is a matter of whether his right to free expression is being restricted or whether he is being politically persecuted. We came to the conclusion that neither of these are the case. That is the reason for our decision in committee and why this report states what it does. I can only recommend that plenary also votes in favour of our report as a whole. Bernhard Rapkay,  
on behalf of the S&amp;D Group.

 Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, the explanatory statement from the rapporteur is quite correct and needs no amplification. For this reason, my group will give its consent to enhanced cooperation. There were also some contrary opinions among us – this is quite legitimate and these voices should be heard. However, what the rapporteur, Council Presidency and Commissioner have had to say shows that the time has really come and that we cannot drag our feet any longer. It is not the case, as some people claim, that this has all been agreed in haste without any discussion – like many of the other arguments, this is patently untrue. The language issue did not just become the subject of debate when the Commission presented its last proposal last year; this has been under discussion for a decade or more. There is nothing new about it. Anyone who looks at how different models have been presented and discussed in recent months cannot say that there has not been sufficient discussion. It is time to cut the Gordian knot! The second argument always used here is that we risk destroying the internal market. The fact is that we do not have an internal market where patents are concerned, so we cannot really destroy it. If – as has been the case for a long time – we are clear about the fact that the internal market really does need a uniform patent process in order to reach completion, then the entire internal market cannot be destroyed by this move. In the worst case scenario, things would remain as they are. I do believe that we will make progress, however. The third specific argument used is that Parliament would weaken its rights by consenting to enhanced cooperation: none of this is true. I would advise you to take a look at the Treaty of Lisbon and our Rules of Procedure. We will not relinquish a single right. We are now approving enhanced cooperation and, when this begins, we shall all have our individual rights. With regard to the language regime, of course this is simply a matter of consultation, since unanimity is required here. Codecision should apply to the actual patent regulation and the approval of patent jurisdiction, however. We are not relinquishing a single right, quite the opposite in fact. Bernhard Rapkay,  
rapporteur.

 Madam President, Mr Almunia, ladies and gentlemen, firstly, I would like to congratulate you, Mr Almunia, and your offices. The impact assessment that you have presented is very good. It is based on facts, it is conclusive and it gets to the point. It is a pity that the other members of the College of Commissioners have not read this impact assessment, because if they had read it, they would not have been able to present this proposal, which has nothing at all to do with the impact assessment. I wonder how the College of Commissioners picked the year, for example. There is absolutely no mention of this in the impact assessment. The only thing which might explain it is that 2014 is exactly halfway between 2010 and 2018. That is what it must be. However, it may be that they have also not understood the content. None of the arguments in favour of this proposal can be seriously considered because they are not correct. There is the argument that the State aid scheme adopted in 2002, which is about to expire, was a phasing out arrangement for coal mining. Of course, this is totally incorrect. It was a successor arrangement. I know this, because I was there and I was the rapporteur for Parliament in 2002. This is when the Treaty establishing the European Coal and Steel Community (ECSC) expired after 50 years and a successor arrangement was needed, not only with regard to aid, but also other issues. If this had been a phasing out arrangement, what would have happened, for example, to the ECSC’s assets? It was not a phasing out arrangement, it was a successor arrangement. At the time, we agreed with good reason on a period of eight years for this successor arrangement, after which we would look at the issue again. Therefore, this argument is incorrect. The second argument which is put forward is the question of sustainability. We are all in favour of this and we know that coal, of course, produces large quantities of CO2
 emissions. However, a decision made by the Commission cannot abolish the laws of science. What will happen next? Domestic coal will be replaced by imported coal. That is the only thing that will happen. Imported coal emits just the same amount of CO2
 as domestic coal. The problem is simply that if we no longer have reference points, we will not be able to use them in the development of new, state-of-the-art technologies for mining and power stations. Europe is a leader in this area and has an export advantage. I do not believe that we should just give this up. The third argument is that aid is harmful and that the money would be better spent on other things. It is not possible to say anything against this argument or against the attitude of market radicals. You cannot oppose an ideology with facts. However, the statement that this would be too expensive, for example, should be looked at in the light of what it would really mean if mining were to be stopped abruptly, and 2014 would be an abrupt stop. It would result in an increase in the costs of combating unemployment and, above all, in the costs relating to long-term pit closures. This is a very complicated and complex subject. The costs of long-term pit closures continue to be incurred years and even decades after coal mining comes to an end. The costs have to be paid out of the public purse. However, some Member States have a system in place which ensures that the state is not responsible for these costs. Therefore, this argument also does not hold water. For this reason, I recommend that you think this over again as soon as possible and that you pay attention to what is said in the impact assessment. Otherwise, the result will be regional and socio-political distortions, which we do not want. This is why the 2018 proposal is highly sensible. Bernhard Rapkay,  
rapporteur.
 – (DE)
 Madam President, Mr Almunia, that is exactly the problem. You are right when you confirm to Mr Lange that it is a Council regulation. However, it also depends on whether the Commission hears the arguments put forward in the Council and here in Parliament. You must drop this very stringent proposal, as you have done, so that it is possible for a sensible, democratic approach to be taken, which involves a majority decision that does not require unanimity. I would like to make a second remark to Mr Chatzimarkakis. The review clause which you referred to is completely irrelevant in this case. The disputes which took place in Germany were only intended to save the face of the Minister for Economic Affairs there, nothing more. Now, I would like to look at the concern expressed by Mr Almunia. No one here and not even the report itself is questioning the fact that this is a phasing out arrangement, Mr Almunia. Whether it is sensible in terms of energy policy or technology is another question. What Mr Geier said is absolutely correct, but we are not calling that into question. The only question is whether we should do this relatively abruptly in 2014 or whether there are sensible transitional arrangements for 2018. Otherwise, we are not questioning anything. The situation is not as described by Mr Lambert, for example, who read out his speech and then left. He should have stayed here, because he might have learned something. It is not the case that there are Member States who have done nothing at all. That is not true of Spain, of Poland, of Romania or of Germany. In 1990, more than 200 000 people were working in the mining industry in Germany. Now, 20 years later, the figure is around 20 000. This represents a drop of 90%, leaving only 10% of the jobs still in place. There have been a number of pit closures between 2002 and the present day during the period of this regulation, which is still in force. Let us not behave as if nothing has happened. The question is whether or not we need a sensible transitional period to be able to achieve this without causing socio-political damage. I can only say, yes, we do need one. This four-year period should not be an issue, because no one is calling that into question anyway. Please take that message back to the Commission. Bernhard Rapkay,  
rapporteur.

 Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, and when I say ‘ladies and gentlemen’, I include you, Baroness Ashton, Mr Šefčovič, your team and the Council Presidency, because, at the end of the day, we experienced collegial cooperation, without which we would surely not have achieved the result that we did. I am happy with the result, at least as regards the part for which I was responsible and where I had a grasp of the overall picture. However, I would say that this is not so very surprising, because it is not as if we have only just started. Mr President, it was a very clever idea of yours to call all the rapporteurs together on a regular basis for an exchange of ideas right from an early stage – back at the time of the Brok, Verhofstadt and Gualtieri reports. As a result, for the relevant people, it was clear what would need to be done later, and for those who were to do this later work, it was clear what had already been done in terms of preparatory work. For this reason, it was primarily a matter of applying to the Staff Regulations the organisational aspects of what had been agreed between Parliament and the Council in connection with the establishment of the European External Action Service in the particular areas of competence covered by these Staff Regulations. When I say organisational, I mean that organisation is policy and policy is organisation. That is, of course, something that we found repeatedly during the detailed negotiations, because it was already clear at that point that perhaps one person may interpret something one way and others may interpret it somewhat differently. However, the spirit of cooperation resulted, I believe, in us finding very sensible solutions to such issues. What did we actually need to do, then, in terms of policy adjustment and what did we need to lay down in the Staff Regulations? Firstly, we had to incorporate the equal treatment of the three staffing components. I want to mention this point because, as you know, the treaty states that the staff of the EEAS shall comprise officials from the Commission, the Council and from the diplomatic services of the Member States. The last of these elements, in particular, did pose something of an issue, as it was something new. We had to resolve the almost antagonistic contradiction between the Community approach and the intergovernmental approach. It goes without saying that the Council and the Member States take more of an intergovernmental approach, while we prefer the Community approach. I believe I can say that we then worked out a solution to this together. To that extent, then, we can be very satisfied. What we needed, and indeed must continue, to take into account is gender balance and a balance in terms of geographical origin. We want to have a service that is modern, including with regard to the issue of gender equality. I am pleased, Baroness Ashton, that, in addition to what we have incorporated into the Staff Regulations as mandatory, you have assured us that you will make another personal statement, which will form part of the whole package. That already represents considerable progress with regard to both the aspect of gender equality and the other aspect of geographical balance. We need equal rights and equal obligations, and that includes loyalty – and indeed from all three components – towards the institution of the High Representative, currently embodied by Baroness Ashton. In this regard, we had a bit of additional work to do as far as the veto right of the diplomatic services was concerned in connection with possible extensions to the contracts of staff coming from the diplomatic services. However, we resolved this, too. There is one issue that should not be underestimated. We jointly agreed that this issue cannot be accommodated in the Staff Regulations. This is the fact that the new European diplomatic service also needs something of a separate identity. Everyone working there must be working towards the same goal and therefore, a common form of training and further training is also extremely important. That was especially important to some of my fellow negotiators, and I can understand that. I have just said that we did not succeed in doing this. It was clear that it would not be possible to incorporate something like this into the Staff Regulations systematically. However, here, once again, I have to thank the High Representative, because I have been informed that she also wants to say something about this and that she regards it as a major obligation and a major necessity and will also make another declaration of commitment in this regard, which, although not a component of the Staff Regulations, will reassure us and those who view it as particularly important as we look to the future work of the common External Action Service. Bearing all that in mind, we have done a very good job, and the service is now set for a sound start on 1 December. Bernhard Rapkay,  
rapporteur.

 Madam President, after my speech at the start of this debate, I actually only have two more comments to make. The first, which I quite deliberately left to the end of the debate, is that I would like to thank all of the shadow rapporteurs for their friendly and constructive cooperation. It is quite simply easier to negotiate when you know that your colleagues support you. For that reason, these were not the most difficult of negotiations. My second comment, however, is one that I would like to reiterate with regard to what has repeatedly been at the centre of this debate, namely, the question of geographical balance. Mrs Neynsky stole the show by saying that the compromise states nothing at all about this. I would simply suggest that, once we have adopted this, she quietly and calmly reads the text. Read the text! Reading the text will enlighten the mind. Then you will see that the compromise most definitely does contain statements – and indeed very strict, legally binding statements – on this matter. Then all of your concerns should, in fact, be dispelled. Matthias Groote and Bernhard Rapkay  (S&amp;D

 The German Social Democratic (SPD) delegation in the European Parliament is in favour of combating international terrorism and providing permanent protection for personal data with the highest possible degree of determination and effectiveness. In view of the importance of data protection, the SPD delegation did not make its decision lightly. After long and careful consideration, however, we are now able to vote in favour of the agreement: the Social Democrats have succeeded in providing for the establishment of permanent European monitoring in connection with the extraction of the data directly on the ground in the US Treasury Department – including the facility to stop the extraction of data. For us, the top priority was limiting the transfer of bulk data. SEPA data are not covered by the agreement; most transfers are not affected at all. The five-year data retention period is intended to be reviewed annually, whereby any data that is not needed is to be deleted sooner than this. In addition, an annual review of compliance with all data protection standards, with the involvement of data protection supervisors, is provided for. Even though we would have preferred the monitoring role and the transfer of data to be given to a judicial authority, Europol must carry out its mandate for approving the data transfer, provided for in the agreement, under the strict scrutiny of the EU. Although Europol has a reliable data protection system, it needs to be brought into line with the Treaty of Lisbon so that it can perform its duties under full democratic scrutiny.

 As the Committee on Legal Affairs’ rapporteur for the European External Action Service, I would like to point out that, including as a result of its amendments to Article 6 of the High Representative’s proposal, the report that has been agreed on today has absolutely no binding effect for me as rapporteur or for the European Parliament as a whole in the discussions on the adaptation of the Staff Regulations. This includes, in particular, the footnotes that were adopted in the text today. A report on a legislative proposal on which the European Parliament was only consulted cannot have any binding effect for the areas in which the European Parliament, by virtue of a different legal basis, has the power of codecision. Birgit Sippel  (S&amp;D

Mr President, almost everything has been said that needs to be said, so I will keep it brief. Why data retention? After all, food stocks have to be replaced sooner or later. That means consuming or using the food and buying a new lot. At the beginning, the debate about data retention focused on its use in anti-terrorism. In practice, however, these data are available, so apparently they have to be used, and they are accessed to investigate a very wide range of crimes, including minor or moderately serious offences. Moreover, in the process, there is a growing data hunger that is driving the storage of types of data that were not originally envisaged. The volume of data is growing. At the very least, then, we must reduce the amount of data stored, the types of use, and the duration of storage. We must protect data from abusive forms of access and use. We should be open to discussing alternatives to the current practice, and we must be mindful of one principle above all: that the rule of law and the protection of civil rights are key pillars of governance in our countries and the EU. They must be respected and defended, if necessary by abolishing the Directive. Birgit Sippel  (S&amp;D

 – (DE) 
Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, naturally it is possible to revise constitutions, media laws, Schengen rules and many other things. However there are rules. If the suspicion exists that existing laws and the values of the European Union are being violated, then this is something that must be pursued, whether in Hungary and Romania, or in France or Denmark, or any other country that could give cause for concern. I wonder, however, not just in view of the present debate, whether all those involved are really concerned with an objective clarification of events, or whether they are not more interested in party political mud-slinging or scoring party political points through sound-bites. This will not help us win back the confidence of our citizens. We need to arrange for an objective investigation to be carried out, using the same yardstick for all Member States, rather than different standards depending on whether we are located in the north, south, east or west of the European Union. If we consider the issue at the heart of these matters rather than relying on rumours and newspaper reports, then this discussion will have added value for the people of Hungary, Romania, France and Germany, and everyone else. Birgit Sippel  (S&amp;D

 – (DE) 
Mr President, let me state quite plainly from the start that freedom of movement within the EU is not a national right and thus cannot be restricted solely on a national basis. As the only elected European institution, the European Parliament must be fully consulted and given a say on all questions, whether relating to changes in the Schengen area or violations of Schengen rules. The reference to serious deficiencies at our external borders is dubious and factually incorrect. That is because the issue at stake is not just border controls, but also the excessive demands on some states immediately to investigate the legal status of every single refugee, thereby establishing clear perspectives for them. As Europeans, we must meet these challenges together, rather than sowing the seeds of uncertainty among our citizens with a crassly populist approach. This joint approach would be effective for our countries and our citizens, as well as for the refugees themselves. We should not regress to a parochial standpoint, because the fact is we need more Europe, not less. Birgit Sippel  (S&amp;D
). 
 – (DE) 
Mr President, a number of years ago, terrorist attacks were given as the reason for introducing measures such as the retention of data or PNR. Obviously, terrorism alone is no longer enough to justify this gathering of data to our citizens, however. That is why we are currently talking about serious and organised crime and debating human trafficking; however the fact is that despite the millions of data records already on file, there have only been a few isolated successes so far. Ms Malmström argues that data protection has been improved, referring in particular to the fact that some data will be retained for ‘only’ 10 years. Data protection begins at an earlier stage, however, for example when a specific limitation of purpose is applied or when restricting the data that needs to be collected. What is it that the agreement that is to be voted on today allows? The retention of millions of data records relating mostly to completely innocent citizens, that will be checked and rechecked with different criteria for almost every conceivable purpose for the next 10 years. Other criminal activities are punishable with a custodial sentence of three years. The German Government has this to say on its website: Those travelling to the US should consider that some offences that do not even warrant a judicial process in Germany are punishable with custodial sentences of several years in the US. Penalties must apply across borders. According to the wording, it is sufficient for the suspect to intend to cross the border. This is something we all want to do when we travel to the US, as we already have the ticket for our return flight in our pockets. Furthermore, any court can demand this information. Will we have better data protection? In view of the broad range of applications, the possibility of data being forwarded to other authorities and to third countries is more than questionable. It is also regrettable that there is at present no provision for the participation of data protection specialists in the planned evaluation. At this point I do not wish to go into the fact that, in the US, terrorist suspects frequently remain in prison for several years awaiting official charges. A number of these people are innocent. We need to combat terrorism. However, this formulation clearly goes too far. Every citizen comes under suspicion and is delivered up to the US legal system, instead of protecting our values and the rights of our people. I have one final comment: Mr Albrecht asked whether those who vote in favour of the agreement should feel ashamed. No, no one should be ashamed about the way they vote today. Nonetheless, I am extremely concerned at the direction we would take by adopting this agreement and for this reason I am absolutely against it. Birgit Sippel  (S&amp;D

 Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, in the light of the history of the Hungarian people, it is particularly tragic that their own government is now withholding important rights from the citizens of Hungary. I would like to say to some speakers that even if a party was really elected by two-thirds of the people entitled to vote, it still has a specific responsibility in a democratic system to ensure that the political minority can present its views in the media and that the political minority is personally represented in the media, in the judiciary and in other areas. This is a principle which lies at the heart of democratic systems and it is a tragedy that this is not happening. The fact that we have to hold this debate today, and it is a good thing that we are doing so, is not just a result of the way in which the Hungarian Government is acting. It is also because the Council was not able in the past in the case of Hungary and in other situations to take up a clear position and to put the European values centre stage. It is also the fault of the European Commission, which has so far failed in its role as guardian of the Treaties. In the case of the independence of the judiciary, it is not about checking whether the change in the upper age limit for judges is in line with the anti-discrimination directive, instead we need to evaluate the entire package. Is the assumption justified that in future only members of a certain party will be represented in certain areas? I believe that, in the current difficult situation and in order to overcome the major challenges which face us, we need all the Member States and all the citizens of the European Union. For this reason, we must focus on values and not on individual laws. Birgit Sippel,  (S&amp;D

Madam President, I would like to propose a minor addition on behalf of my group in order to ensure that the rights of children and mothers are respected after sentencing. We would like to make an insertion after paragraph 4. I will read our proposal in English:  Reaffirms the importance of granting specific protection to mother detainees and to their children including through the use of alternative measures to detention in the child’s best interest, and calls on Member States and the Commission to actively promote and support such initiatives’.

 Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, why is it even necessary, in this House, in this European Union, to discuss detention conditions? The increasing mobility of our citizens and, in particular, the increased cooperation between the police force and the judicial system, as well as joint measures such as the European arrest warrant, require confidence. This is the confidence that everywhere in the EU, the Charter of Fundamental Rights and the Convention on Human Rights are being observed. It is confidence in properly functioning legal systems based on the principle of the presumption of innocence, in which a punishment is a punishment, not revenge or humiliation. However, many reports in the last few years and also many judgments of the European Court of Human Rights make it clear that we are still a long way from achieving this. The poor conditions relate to overcrowded prisons, a lack of opportunities for contact, a lack of medical care and many other issues besides. We urgently need common minimum standards for detention conditions and also for pre-trial detention. Long pre-trial detention periods, particularly if it is not in the person’s own Member State, can result in the loss of social contacts and jobs and, due to language barriers, they can entail isolation during detention. Therefore, in particular with regard to minor offences, alternatives to all forms of detention must be given greater consideration. The Commission’s Green Paper cites a number of examples in this regard. However, these need to be applied a great deal more in practice. The conclusion, then, is that minimum standards for detention conditions, a greater use of alternatives and special forms of accommodation for pregnant women and children are essential steps for us to take. The European Parliament has already called for changes to detention conditions in the past. Now, we must finally take specific measures. That is what we are calling for most strongly today and tomorrow. Birgit Sippel

 Mr President, Commissioner Reding, ladies and gentlemen, in the current times it is more important than ever to keep repeating that the European Union is more than just a market. It is a community of values, and it is precisely in difficult times that it must prove itself to be a strong community of values in all policy areas. The EU and its Member States are based on the common principles of freedom, democracy and the rule of law. An indispensable element of the rule of law in the context of criminal proceedings is the presumption of innocence, supported by clear and comprehensive procedural rights for the accused persons. Following the directive on the right to interpretation and to translation, the new directive on the right to information in criminal proceedings is a further important cornerstone in ensuring that suspected and accused persons are given a fair trial across the EU. The development of equal standards for procedural rights in criminal matters will strengthen our citizens’ trust in the judicial systems of the Member States. The mutual recognition of court decisions will also encourage this. An individual can only comprehensively exercise his procedural rights if he knows what those rights are. For a fair trial, it is crucial that people are aware of their rights and that they know what the accusation against them is. If authorities fail to observe these procedural rights, then they jeopardise the fairness of the proceedings and risk miscarriages of justice. The existing EU legal framework in the judicial area focuses on improved cooperation between judicial authorities. In contrast, the new directive concentrates on our citizens and the rights they enjoy in criminal proceedings. It states that police officers and prosecutors must provide people who have been arrested with written information concerning their rights in simple terms in a language they can understand. In addition to the right to interpretation and translation, this includes in particular informing them of the accusation against them, of the right to legal assistance and of the right to be heard by a judge without delay following arrest. In addition, Parliament has been able to expand the specific rights of which the suspect is to be informed. We have succeeded in integrating into the directive the right of access to medical assistance, the right to communication with relatives and the right to remain silent. No one knows in advance how long a suspected person will remain in pre-trial detention, for how long he will be deprived of his liberty. It is therefore important that he is informed of his rights at an early stage and is also given access to material evidence for and against him. The accused person must not become the object of the criminal proceedings, but rather must be able to play an active part in the proceedings. The Member States must now adopt and implement the directive as soon as possible. Finally, I would like to offer my thanks to the services of Parliament and of the Commission – and I would particularly like to thank the shadow rapporteurs, whose perseverance and really outstanding cooperation have made this report possible. It is now important that the Council and Commission bring the follow-up measures to this directive to a rapid conclusion jointly with the European Parliament, thereby creating uniform standards and fair trials throughout the EU. Birgit Sippel 
, rapporteur.

 Mr President, I believe Ms Reding has said it already; today’s debate has underlined once again what the unanimous decision in the Committee on Civil Liberties, Justice and Home Affairs made clear – namely that strengthening procedural rights is a concern of us all, whatever group we belong to and, to a certain extent, whichever Member State we represent. I therefore hope – and I am very confident about this – that we will again get a good proposal from the Commission for the next measure, which is the right to a lawyer; that we will be able to improve on this even further and that, following our discussions with the Council, we will once again be able to achieve a very good directive. I wish the rapporteur, Ms Antonescu, all the best with this and I believe she can count on the support of this House. Birgit Sippel  (S&amp;D

Madam President, the directive on combating the sexual abuse, sexual exploitation of children and child pornography sends out a clear message. This subject is an important one and one that concerns the whole of Europe, and uniform rules for the definition of offences and also for the penalties apply universally. Common arrangements for the prosecution of crimes committed outside the EU are still needed. The same applies to common standards for calling legal persons to account. The directive gives specific penalty options in this regard. One key area, however, was offences committed on the Internet. Here ‘grooming’ is now made punishable. It is also important that all Member States are obliged to take measures to get websites containing child pornography deleted. However, in addition to this there remains an important requirement for all institutions of the European Union, in their international cooperation with other states, to ensure that the principle of deletion should take precedence in other countries of the world, too. A great deal of abuse takes place in real life in our children’s immediate environment. Therefore, prevention mechanisms are particularly important, as is instruction in the use of media, so that, when using new media, our children and young people are able to recognise the sources of danger. Protection measures are obviously particularly important from the point of view of those affected, both for children during criminal proceedings and also in the form of special support for children and their families outside the context of such proceedings. The Member States have a particular duty here. Overall, after difficult negotiations, we have obtained a good directive. Following its adoption, it will be up to the Member States to implement it and put it into practice as quickly and as comprehensively as possible. To finish I would like to make one more personal comment. Even though a different decision has now been taken, I would have liked there to be correlation tables for all directives in future. The fact that we will not now have this quick overview of the implementation of measures is something that I personally find very disappointing. Birgit Sippel,

 Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, PNR data is nothing new – after all this information has been gathered since commercial aviation was in its infancy. Likewise, the use of this data, for example for border control purposes, is nothing new. Nonetheless, a problem arises here which is also familiar in other areas: in an increasingly mobile world with modern information technology, data is available in quite different dimensions than was the case 50 or even 30 years ago. This is also the reason why data protection is becoming increasingly important. We have achieved a great deal with this agreement: a clear definition of potential uses, good data protection standards and clear rules for legal certainty and judicial remedy. The changeover from the pull system to the push system is also important. Data is not simply collected, but is sent to Australia. We have not been able to achieve all our demands, however. One of the major points at issue from our perspective is the five-and-a-half-year retention period. We would have liked to see a much shorter period. So, what can we do about it? Do we vote in favour of the agreement or do we reject it? I would like to make two comments. We will never achieve one hundred per cent of our demands. So, we need to weigh things up. Data would continue to be transferred even if we rejected the agreement, however then we would have no clear rules on how this data should be handled. That is why I hope that this agreement will receive majority support tomorrow, despite many reservations. In relation to the forthcoming agreement with the US, I would like to state clearly: we want an agreement here too, but a 15-year retention period is a much longer time. I genuinely fail to see why we cannot change over completely to the push system here. We need to make improvements in this area. We want uniform standards for all agreements in relation to PNR data, rather than a patchwork of arrangements in which the rights of our citizens are dealt with in different ways. Birgit Sippel  (S&amp;D

Madam President, the new mandate for Frontex is a contribution to bringing about the situation whereby, whilst our borders are given the necessary protection, human rights are observed and those seeking protection actually receive it. There are many areas where I would have liked to have seen something better, for example, when it comes to independent observers. Yet whatever you may think of this new mandate, the situation will remain a patchwork. In all the criticism of Frontex – including the justified criticism – one point is often overlooked, and that is the participation and responsibility of the Member States in their collaboration with the agency. Unfortunately, they are not something that we can reform! It would be an important further step though, if we could finally, for example, put in place a uniform and improved European asylum system. The new Frontex mandate may be a step in the right direction, but critical follow-up continues to be absolutely necessary. The discussion about protecting our borders and about the rights of refugees will not be concluded simply as a result of this new mandate. Birgit Sippel

 Madam President, I must admit to the House that I am a little confused where the debate on passenger name records (PNR) is concerned, because the facts and the issues that need to be clarified are not new. Nonetheless, one gets the impression that we are not making any progress – worse still, that we are moving back to worse conditions than those previously agreed. The signing of the agreement with Australia is currently also stalled because the Member States have asked for more time to review it. I fear that the reality is somewhat different, but I would like to hope that this has something to do with the fact that the Member States, too, have realised that not every means is justified in the fight against terror. As most of us here will remember, negotiations on the SWIFT Agreement were very difficult, but were eventually brought to a successful conclusion. I am astonished that we are now moving at a different level as regards data protection and data security, and I get the impression that we are back to standards below those that we have agreed previously. A retention period of 15 years is far too long. In the case of the 11 September 2001 attack that was so incisive for the US, for example, 15-year-old data would have been no help whatsoever because the perpetrators were much too young for data that was so old to have had any relevance. In my view, there is a very close link between proportionality and the use of data for a particular purpose. You cannot collect millions of data records from innocent citizens for 15 years and then say: ‘Actually, we are going to use this data for everything’, as is currently stated in the text of the US agreement. That is not acceptable. I would like to make it quite clear that this requirement applies not just to the US, but also to the Commission and to our Member States. If you adopt a measure to fight terrorism and serious international crime, then this measure must be limited to precisely that and cannot be expanded to allow other areas to be included by the back door.

 Madam President, in the debate on the Hungarian constitution, we heard more than once the criticism that it was a political debate. I am completely taken aback by that, because having political debates is one of the things that Parliament is expressly there to do; and I therefore want to start this topic by setting out the political framework too. Crime, and organised crime in particular, has never been held back by borders or border controls. It therefore makes no sense to rebuild borders in Europe and to restrict the way our populations are growing together. On the contrary: what we need is the consistent further development of cooperation between our Member States and cross-border cooperation by the police and justice authorities. In this area, the European Arrest Warrant has repeatedly proven itself to be an important and successful instrument. At the same time, however, this instrument will fall into disrepute if European Arrest Warrants are used for, say, stolen bicycles, or merely in order to carry out questioning. I regret to say that we have also found that it is being used when perhaps it has been decided not to execute an arrest warrant because there is evidence to show that it was unjustly issued and this is then not respected by the issuing Member State – resulting in the unfortunate situation in which the citizens concerned are repeatedly arrested whenever they cross a border. That does nothing to help build confidence in European legal systems. Why is this happening? Does the text of the directive leave too much leeway? Is it a matter of incorrect implementation in the Member States or inadequate information? We need to clarify these points, the Member States need to make improvements where necessary, and the Commission must take action to prevent such misuse. That is the only way to prevent a successful instrument being permanently damaged and confidence in these measures being lost. Moreover, all these experiences show how important it is that we finally make some progress on the road map for procedural rights. In the interests of legal certainty for everyone involved, we need to have the same rights across Europe for those accused of offences and there must be mandatory information on these rights. I call on the Commission to exert pressure to counter possible opposition on all these points; I am sure it can count on the support of Parliament in this.

 I am not sure whether I should answer your question, as it is more of a polemic comment. However, the figures show that the European Arrest Warrant is an appropriate instrument for fighting crime in the unified space of Europe. Crime is not national; crime is international and crosses borders. That is why we need to cooperate across borders. We need to deal with the teething problems of the European Arrest Warrant and stop it being misused. As an instrument, however, it is indispensable. Birgit Sippel,  
on behalf of the S&amp;D Group.

Madam President, in a globalised world, terrorism and crime are, unfortunately, also globally organised, and therefore we know that we need to cooperate internationally and need to exchange data. I am very pleased to hear that both the Commission and the Council consider that citizens’ rights and data protection are both matters to be accorded very high priority. However, that does not mean that Parliament can rest on its laurels, since issues such as retention periods, data volumes and purpose limitation, as well as controls and whether protective clauses can really be implemented in the area of data protection, will remain critical points. In this sensitive area, what we need is not blind checks, but more trust. The terms on which data is exchanged must therefore also be set at a particularly high level, since it is not just a matter of specific agreements with Australia and the US; a number of other countries such as Korea and India also already want to have PNR agreements with us. For this reason, too, it is very important that we build in particularly high security standards at this point. The same applies to the forwarding of data to third countries. Here again, we must examine very carefully the terms that we want to incorporate. At the same time, when discussing PNR data, we also need to look beyond this. What is the point of keeping the volume of data as low as possible when negotiating on PNR if the US, as a countermove, announces that it wishes not only to levy an entry fee, but also to collect additional data from passengers? We also have a problem within the European Union. What is the point of agreeing the highest possible standards and attempting to limit data volumes if, at the same time, bilateral agreements are being concluded without us having any knowledge of their content and security standards? Mrs Malmström has said that this is not about PNR data, but rather that all data that is collected should apparently serve the purpose of fighting terrorism and combating crime. I would therefore like to end by making one more request: what we need is not just good provisions on the individual measures, but also at last to take an overall view of all the measures, all the data that is transferred by the EU and the Member States. We need to be quite clear about this: we will never achieve one hundred percent security, however many measures we take and however much data we collect. That is a fact that we have to face up to.

 Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, the Treaty of Lisbon has been mentioned many times today. I should like to say something positive about it for once. Most of our citizens think it is a good thing that we can travel in Europe without borders, that we can move freely about Europe for the purposes of education, work and leisure. However, in so doing, we naturally leave a data trail behind us. For a long time now, our data has not just been stored in one Member State, but is spread throughout the European Union. That is precisely why it is a good thing that we have greater powers at European level in this area – which concerns the protection of data relating to European citizens – because our citizens quite rightly expect their data to be well protected everywhere in Europe and they do not expect large amounts of data to be passed on unnecessarily, possibly even to third countries. How are we, as the European Union – and I will make myself absolutely clear: as the European Parliament and Council; in other words, together with the Member States – supposed to ensure this protection if it is the case that while we, as the European Union, are negotiating with third countries on the forwarding of data – over what data is actually required, the purpose for which it is to be used and the safeguards that are necessary in order to protect this data – at the same time, individual Member States are negotiating with third countries on data? Especially since we do not even know what data they are talking about, what security standards are being maintained, whether duplicate data is possibly being forwarded, or even whether data is being forwarded that we would not allow to be forwarded at European level. There is also another aspect that the Member States are perhaps not taking into sufficient consideration. If a Member State negotiates with a third country, how then can I ensure – how can and will the individual Member State ensure – that only the data of its own citizens is, in fact, forwarded, if any data is forwarded at all? We now have databases within the European Union that collect data on all kinds of citizens at a central point and to which many authorities in European countries have access. In other words, if my data is stored somewhere in country A and country A decides to forward data, will my data also be forwarded to a third country? This cannot be the added value in the European Union that was intended when, for good reason, we negotiated the Treaty of Lisbon. The Member States, too, need to take note of the new balance of power between the institutions, must act accordingly, and must stick to the rules, which state that data protection is a European matter. We need to ensure at European level that as little data as possible is forwarded and only for narrowly defined purposes, and that this is not all undermined by bilateral initiatives.

Madam President, in his introduction, the rapporteur said that Parliament now has to support the agreement. Perhaps that was a mistranslation, but I will nevertheless make it very clear that I do not have to support this agreement and I most definitely will not support it. This first agreement following the entry into force of the Treaty of Lisbon will, in particular, send out a particularly important signal. However, what sort of signal are we sending out to the EU and beyond? Looking at the supporters of the agreement I can, above all, see a biblical principle at work: we wash our hands in innocence – after all, we have a treaty. However, we have absolutely no idea what happens to the people in these countries when we send them back. I would have liked to have seen a greater sensitivity to the issue of the treatment of refugees and of respect for human rights. The adoption of this agreement will severely jeopardise our credibility in matters of democracy and human rights. I would therefore ask all my fellow Members once again not to support this agreement. Birgit Sippel  (S&amp;D

 Mr President, a preliminary remark. To accept or to reject, either decision is worthy of respect. What is not acceptable, however, are certain exaggerations, half-truths and falsehoods, frequently devoid of any knowledge of the facts, which have also been voiced in the published debate. More objectivity and less emotion would surely have been fitting. To come to the point, fighting terrorism is just as much about the defence of democratic values and freedoms. One of these also requires the use of data, while the other requires a high degree of data protection. It is precisely here that, under pressure from the European Parliament, we were able to achieve a great deal: verification that a request is actually founded on a legitimate suspicion of terrorism, and daily checks by EU officials in the US Treasury Department that only data pertaining to suspected terrorists are being examined, including the possibility of stopping the extraction of data. We in Parliament are convinced that this important function must be regulated in agreement with all institutions. Compliance with standards, with the involvement of the Data Protection Officers, must be reviewed annually, and, for a storage period of five years, an annual audit to ensure that data which is not required is deleted in good time. To reiterate, intra-European transfers are not affected. Nonetheless, not everything was achieved. For example, Europol. I should like to ask the European Commission not to wait until 2013, but to prepare draft legislation quickly which ensures parliamentary control by means of codecision. Birgit Sippel,  
on behalf of the S&amp;D Group.

Mr President, I would like to contradict those who have spoken so far on one point: I am not interested in arriving at an agreement as soon as possible, but in achieving one that is as good as possible. Quality must come before timeframe. I would like to make one other preliminary remark. The European Parliament has already rejected an agreement once and one aspect among the many reasons relating to content was the lack of European Parliament participation. In view of current events this week, we have decided not to adopt any decisions here in Parliament. Then there is the decision to call on the Council to likewise postpone its decisions until we can adopt our decisions. I am now rather surprised that there are Members of the House, who clearly do not take their own decisions seriously but think: well yes, despite this, the Council can simply decide. I do not think we can treat our own decisions like that. I still maintain that the Council should also withhold its decision until after 6 May when we have decided. I am sure there are no disadvantages to this and that the United States would be understanding. As for the draft mandate itself, I take a favourable view of the fact that the Commission is committed to meeting our demands. Nevertheless, I would like to say clearly that there still need to be substantial amendments to this negotiating mandate. These are necessary if a majority of the European Parliament is to vote in favour of a new agreement. In my opinion, the current mandate is not ambitious enough to achieve this. The problem of bulk data transfer remains unresolved. If the US authorities tell us that every month we are talking about the specific details of five to ten people, then the transfer of millions of pieces of data relating to European citizens is surely disproportionate to this purpose. Incidentally, I would like to say again to the Commission and the Council that although it is constantly maintained that this agreement will be highly significant as an additional means of combating terrorism, the proof of this is not as clear as we are always being told. The long period of retention of data in the United States also continues to be a problem. The mandate does not offer a solution here either. We need a judicial authority on European soil that not only checks the legality of US applications, but also the extraction of data, wherever this takes place. The transmission of information to third countries must be regulated with clear directives. We need an ambitious mandate with our demands. Only then can we achieve a really good result that meets our demands, taking into account data protection as well as the fight against terror. Finally, I have another specific question for the Council and the Commission. How do you intend to ensure that only data that was specifically requested is extracted and passed on? How can that work? In the United States? Or are there other proposals? Birgit Sippel,  
on behalf of the S&amp;D Group.

Madam President, there are a few basic things I would like to say about this agreement. There are, by all means, similarities with SWIFT, but also differences. If the European Parliament had to vote today on the Passenger Name Record (PNR) agreement, we would have no other option but to vote no. That is quite clear. There are still significant objections to this agreement. I will go into the details once more shortly. That is why I was not happy when we spoke about postponing the vote. However, unlike SWIFT, there were definitely good reasons for this postponement. Nevertheless, I will say quite clearly that, for us, it does not mean that the vote can be postponed indefinitely, so that we now have a provisional agreement for years on end. It is very important to us that we quickly reach a new negotiating mandate and, if possible, before the summer break, so that we can quickly gain clarity in detailed questions on how we should handle this data and what data should be included. Data protection plays an important role and here, I would like to use the opportunity to address once again the question as to what data should be transmitted. PNR covers 19 individual pieces of data. I know from conversations I have had that it is of course possible – if you want to – to create personality profiles from these pieces of data. Now, of course, those with whom we have such an agreement are saying they have no interest in this, they will not do it and that relevant data is erased. However, if certain data that could be used to create a personality profile is not used at all, then we must consider whether it should indeed be collected, or – if we reach an agreement – whether all of the data needs to be transmitted. That is a crucial question. We also have to check what level of protection is afforded to data that is transmitted. We know that the regulations in both agreements with the USA and Australia are very different. With a view to further requests by other countries that want to have similar agreements, we should ensure that every time we reach an agreement, special standards apply. We also have to consider in detail the question of how this data is to be used. Originally, it was always said that it was about combating terrorism. Now however, it is also about serious crime. This can be discussed. However, we must go into great detail here. We know that even within the European Union itself, legal systems and legal culture vary greatly. This may mean that the definition of what constitutes a serious crime is completely different in terms of the type of crime. That means we need to look again in detail at what we are discussing when we say that serious crime should also naturally be included. I hope that in future, with the implementation of the agreement, we ensure that there is a regular exchange of information between the institutions. The President-in-Office of the Council has indicated that there has been a first review as far as the agreement with the USA is concerned. Officially, we still do not have these results yet. That was in February. In future, I would not only like to see reports being drawn up regularly, I would also like to see these reports actually being made available to the European Parliament immediately. It is very important to create a uniform agreement. The issue of data must be reviewed again. However, I believe that, on the basis of the previous discussion, we will probably reach a good agreement, and I therefore view further negotiations as something entirely positive. Birgit Sippel  (S&amp;D

 Mr President, anyone who has followed the many discussions about SWIFT over recent weeks might get the impression that without SWIFT, we would descend into chaos and that rejecting the agreement would bring an end to the transatlantic relationship and the joint war on terror. These attempts to threaten us can be described in one word: ridiculous. The US and the Council are not trying to rescue an essential tool; they are simply saving face. There are many agreements and measures in place to combat terrorism. SWIFT could be a useful addition to these. The failed attack on 25 December has clearly demonstrated that it is not data we are lacking, but the ability to make effective use of the data which we already have. The idea is to divert attention away from this fact. The interim agreement simply could not be worse. It is full of contradictions and inconsistencies. Instead of suitable precautions being taken to ensure that only data relating to people who are actually under suspicion is transferred, huge volumes of data will be sent to the US every month. The agreement represents a flagrant breach of citizens’ rights, data protection and the principles of the rule of law. If the Council and the US were really prepared to take on board this criticism and to incorporate these points into a new agreement, then there would be no need for us to accept this dreadful agreement. In the interests of the citizens, we must say no to the interim agreement and we must start new negotiations immediately, so that we can put in place a really good agreement which acts as an additional, effective tool for combating terrorism and which preserves our fundamental rights. Birgit Sippel  (S&amp;D

 Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, we should discuss today’s debate, and particularly the decisions which follow the discussion, not from a formal, but rather a political perspective. Uniform standards for laboratory work are, of course, also important for cooperation between the police and the judiciary that is based on trust. However, there are many aspects of this matter which time does not permit us to discuss. In principle, however, the core issue is altogether different, namely how seriously the political acteurs
 take the Treaty of Lisbon, the rights of the Parliament and the citizens, as well as the trustworthy cooperation of the Council and the Parliament. I would like to give three examples: the Treaty of Lisbon describes the High Representative as a strong voice for Europe, and it is a great shame that the Member States have clearly also applied different criteria in this case. The agreement on SWIFT codes, which is controversial in many ways, could once again be subjected to careful scrutiny by the European Parliament next Monday. Instead, it is to be quickly ticked off the list a few hours beforehand and signed with the United States. We are facing the same situation with the topics we are dealing with here. Shortly before the Treaty of Lisbon enters into force, we are being asked to quickly push through decisions, which include provisions for the future which will limit our scope for making decisions, or at least significantly restrict them. We have to ask ourselves why this is the case, as it was certainly possible to submit new proposals on other issues. The Council’s and the Commission’s stance lost them the chance to send a clear message to the people of Europe, a sign of commitment to implementing the treaty, a sign of a democratic Europe of the citizens. We, the European Parliament, have only one option: we must reject these proposals, as we want a broad public debate and we want to use our strengthened rights to support the citizens now, rather than in the near or more distant future. Constanze Angela Krehl  (S&amp;D

 Mr President, this morning we have talked a great deal about targeted growth in the European Union. The cohesion policy is a European investment programme that we have at our disposal for creating growth. For this reason, we need at least as much money in the future budget as we have had available to date. The Friends of Cohesion are not against better spending of the money. However, I am not sure whether the friends of better spending in the Council really want good cohesion policy, which is something we need in order to overcome the crisis. There is a second point I would like to mention. In the negotiation box, which has also been mentioned frequently here, 90% of all points in the area of cohesion policy are basically decided with the European Parliament in the ordinary legislative procedure. Please would you accept that this time, for the first time, Parliament is involved in the ordinary legislative procedure for all areas of cohesion policy. The negotiations in committee will be complete in mid-July. We will then have a mandate and be able to negotiate. I hope that the Council will be prepared to do the same at that time. Constanze Angela Krehl,

 Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, it has so often been said that small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs) lie at the heart of the European Union’s economy and this is indeed the case. We are doing a great deal for them. I believe that this is something really special because, in contrast to other large economic areas, we have smaller companies which are competitive on global markets and which are flexible enough to adapt to changing conditions. That is the special feature of SMEs in the European Union and we are providing them with support. They are at the centre of our structural policy not just in the next subsidy period, but also here and now. We have done a lot to ensure that they can access the money from the Structural Funds more easily. However, I believe that there is potential for further improvement and simplification in this area. When a small company applies for a loan at favourable interest rates, it should not be necessary for the company to fill out reams of forms. I think that there is still room for improvement here. However, I also believe that by means of an intelligent initiative, we can encourage SMEs to create closer links between economic growth, an innovative approach to economic development and the struggle to reduce youth unemployment levels. Mr Hahn said in a previous debate that if every company in Europe were to hire just one young person, the problem of youth unemployment would effectively go away. He is right to a certain extent. I am not trying to say that we should insist that money from the European Union will only be made available when companies take on one or two young people. That sort of approach reminds me of my past in the German Democratic Republic, which was also unable to resolve this sort of problem. However, I think it is worth considering how we can establish an intelligent project that could be subsidised by the European Union and would give young people real opportunities for training followed by jobs within companies. Perhaps we will be able to make progress in this area in time for the next subsidy period. However, I must make it clear that I do not want to see merely windfall effects for companies. There must be lasting growth and a lasting reduction in unemployment. I do have one request for the Commission. I know that the Commission is currently reviewing competition law. It would be very helpful in this respect if we could ensure that regions are not pulled apart and that the subsidy conditions in one region are not completely different from those in another. This would lead to more bureaucracy and make access to subsidy funding much more difficult. I hope that the Commission can come up with a positive proposal in this area which will not result in the regions being torn apart. Constanze Angela Krehl  (S&amp;D
),

Targeted investment in business, infrastructure and renewable energies will be required in Greece in order to get the country back on its feet. This is precisely the purpose of the funds provided for under European cohesion policy. In order to implement our projects, however, we need money from private investors. These are unable to raise the necessary loans at present, however, because the banks mostly view any investment in Greece as too risky. That is why I believe we should use part of the funds already allocated to Greece to secure such loans. The banks can rest assured that they will get their money back, while investors will get their much-needed loans and can therefore participate in EU projects, enabling Greece to create several thousand jobs. The advantage of the report is also that it enables very efficient use of the precious funding that is available: by simply using these resources to secure the risk, we can generate more investment than if the money were to be invested directly in projects. Finally, this report makes one thing clear: the European Union is right behind Greece and private investors can rely on this fact. Constanze Angela Krehl,  
on behalf of the S&amp;D Group
. – (DE) 
Madam President, Commissioner, I would like to make three brief points in response to this oral question. First of all, I very much welcome the fact that the Commission wants to put tackling youth unemployment at the heart of its policy. Giving hope and a future to young people is part of our remit and it is very important to us. Secondly, I also welcome the fact that the Commission is increasingly realising that, in a time of economic crisis more than ever, cuts are not the only route to success: we also need investment. In that respect, SMEs should, of course, be our topmost priority, because they create the most jobs and are very important for economic development. Thirdly, let me be very clear and open about this: it appears, from what is being said in the media, that Mr Barroso has been giving the impression that he is able to stump up EUR 82 billion for this European Union, with the throwaway comment afterwards that that money will no longer be spent as planned in the cohesion policy, anyway; we will, instead, be able to use that money right away to do precisely what we have just been talking about: namely, tackling youth unemployment and supporting SMEs. EUR 82 billion – that is almost a quarter of the total cohesion policy budget up to 2013. As far as I am aware, that money is already tied up in programmes and projects. How exactly do you intend to go about this: that is, allowing all the regions, all of a sudden, to start doing something completely different with that money and, then, because the youth unemployment figures are not so high in your neck of the woods, making some of that money available to other countries? The regions have responded to this with dismay. I have received a lot of calls from people asking me: what is going on? Is the money being taken away from us? What is the point of that? Let me give you a word of warning. The cohesion policy has really been a tremendously successful policy and one that has been extremely tangible and comprehensible to citizens. It creates trust. If we now start making vague statements like this, which create the impression that we have money left over, that our policy so far has not been adequate, or that we can rustle up a couple of billion just like that, that will not create any additional trust, but only uncertainty. Most importantly, when I consider the fact that the Council has failed to provide the full amount of funds considered necessary by the Commission and Parliament for this year’s budget negotiations and the fact that, according to the information I have received, some EUR 15 billion are needed this year for projects that have already been completed, but we only have EUR 5 billion, at the very most, at our disposal, then I really wonder how anyone can go around implying that Member States are prepared to fork out more money and allocate additional funds for the cohesion policy. I think that we need to be careful that we actually pursue the right policy and that we offer support to countries with high youth unemployment. However, I would also like us to ensure that we do not create even more uncertainty for people in times that are difficult enough already. Constanze Angela Krehl  (S&amp;D

 Mr President, there is broad agreement both in Parliament and in the Commission on the future importance of cohesion policy for all the regions in Europe. I would like to ask Mr Hahn how the Commission intends to ensure that genuine flexibility within the regions can be guaranteed, given the differences between the regions and their different levels of growth, if everything is being controlled with great precision under the terms of the regulations and there is hardly any scope to accommodate the specific features of each region.

 Does this mean that a region which has already introduced extensive energy efficiency measures will not be forced to do so, but could instead invest in research facilities and that this could be laid down in the partnership contract? Constanze Angela Krehl,  
on behalf of the S&amp;D Group
. – (DE) 
Madam President, cohesion policy is a successful European policy which everyone makes use of, including regions which are not as well developed and those which already have a strong economy. A variety of studies have demonstrated this. However, most importantly, the citizens of Europe can experience its benefits at first hand. This is why we need cohesion policy in future in all the regions of the European Union. Nevertheless, we are under an obligation to make our good policies even better. This is what the European Parliament is aiming to achieve with Mr Pieper’s report. Modern cohesion policy means facing the new challenges, creating up-to-date infrastructure, combating climate change, supporting energy security and efficiency, promoting research and development, providing support for small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs) and creating jobs. Of course, we also need to ensure that the funding is used efficiently. Therefore, we are making it clear that cohesion policy must be more transparent and results-oriented and must involve less red tape. The coordination between the various funds and programmes must also be improved, as Mr Stavrakakis said earlier. One very important point is that the partnership principle must be taken to a new and better level. We must involve everyone, including the regions, local areas, both sides of industry and major non-governmental organisations. The new intermediate category remains controversial. We are of the opinion that the intermediate category will help regions which need more support than the classic Objective 2 regions. They will not be funded at the expense of other regions. On the contrary, the result will not be a patchwork of subsidies. Instead the many phasing-in and phasing-out procedures will be standardised and I believe that this is something which we really need in the European Union. Anyone who thinks that we are introducing a permanent subsidy category is underestimating the European Parliament. Over the past few years we have demonstrated often enough that we are able to bring in community initiatives when they are needed. However, we have also worked jointly to remove them again once the objective has been achieved. We are competent enough to be able to judge at the end of a subsidy period whether the results are good and how we should redesign the programme. Therefore, I am calling on my fellow Members to support this new intermediate category when it comes to the vote. Constanze Angela Krehl,  
rapporteur for the opinion of the Committee on Regional Development.
 – (DE)
 Mr President, cohesion policy accounts for one of the largest individual budgets in the European Union. We need to develop a new policy that is adapted to the new challenges. We want investment in a modern infrastructure, in research, innovation and the development of new technologies. We want sustainable, integrated urban development and we want a well-educated workforce. The regions need specific subsidies to help them to become competitive and to develop economically. However, at the same time, it must be said that all regions must have access to cohesion policy, both Eastern European Member States and strong national economies like Germany. Eastern Germany requires support. However, some western German regions require European aid, as do parts of the United Kingdom. This requires a budget that should be no smaller than the current one and that cannot be split into different sectors. We must make every effort to improve efficiency and transparency and we must link this with an abandonment of unnecessary bureaucracy. Cohesion is linked with solidarity. However, cohesion is also sensible from an economic point of view and necessary. A lack of cohesion is bad news, even for strong national economies. For this reason, we should provide appropriate financial backing for cohesion policy. I would like to thank the rapporteur for including the opinion of the Committee on Regional Development in his report and I would ask for support for the amendment for once again improving the intermediate categories. We have reached a compromise in the Committee on Regional Development and I would recommend that this House should incorporate the compromise found by the specialist politicians in the Garriga Report. I would ask for your broad support. Constanze Angela Krehl,

 Mr President, Commissioners, ladies and gentlemen, in the European Union, cohesion policy means that we aim to lend our support to the weaker regions. It is an expression of major European solidarity. Solidarity, however, is never a one-way street, and my group therefore backs the principle that all the regions of the European Union must be able to participate in our cohesion policy. For us, this also means that we will not support any measures of renationalisation and that we do not want to see cohesion policy fragmented into sector-based policy approaches. We do not need any extra transport or climate protection or energy efficiency funds, but we do need to work on how we reconcile the challenges we face with a sound cohesion policy. It is therefore clear to us that, alongside a strong Objective 1 area, we also need a strong Objective 2 area, and appropriate transitional rules. One thing is for certain, and that is that regions need our support at the European level. The European Union needs strong regions, too, and there is therefore a give and take in both directions. Of course, we need to review our priorities – clearly, we do need greater efficiency. My group is therefore four-square behind the proposal, in order, for example, to be able to coordinate rural development much better together under the umbrella of cohesion policy than in the past. Of course, we also back improving infrastructure, supporting businesses and supporting sustainable economic development. However, sustainable economic development is only possible if we bring the employed – the people – with us. In other words, we need employment policy approaches, we need education, we need training, we need people to integrate into the labour market. That, in turn, is only possible in collaboration with the European Social Fund, under the umbrella of cohesion policy. We support this, but with dedicated rules, which there did used to be in the past. We need to really make an effort to improve this and significantly strengthen the social side of cohesion policy. In the forthcoming discussions and negotiations, my group will be going in to bat for improving and simplifying the usability of the fund. We need a simplification of the application processes so that, first of all, fewer errors are made, and, secondly, so that access for those people who really want to work can be made easier through this European cohesion policy. We will strive to ensure that, in these negotiations, a stronger partnership principle really is implemented. I believe that Parliament’s role has been strengthened now that the Treaty of Lisbon is in force. My group will be arguing the case for this partnership principle. Constanze Angela Krehl  (S&amp;D

 Mr President, the current Cohesion policy started life with the title of the Lisbon Strategy. However, I firmly believe that the Cohesion policy can, and will, make an enormous contribution to the Europe 2020 strategy, not just because we command a considerable budget in comparison with other European policies but, above all, because the Cohesion policy allows us to have sustainable development in our regions and ensures good monitoring of the restructuring processes and challenges in our regions. However, there is one core issue here that I would like to clarify once again, and that goes for our group as well: our Cohesion policy can only work if economic development is considered to be equally as important as social development and providing training for workers. In principle, we need to take joint responsibility for the funds that are available to us. It is a bit like hardware and software – one cannot work without the other. Constanze Angela Krehl,  
deputising for the rapporteur.

 Mr President, I am very sorry that Mr Kirilov cannot present the report himself. He has worked very hard to draw up a report for Parliament on a subject which is very important for the regions and the citizens of the European Union. Therefore, I would like to read out his notes. They are in English, which is very surprising for a Bulgarian Member. However, it is a good thing that I do not have to speak Bulgarian. I am very pleased that I can represent him here in Parliament, even though he was unable to get a flight in Sofia.  Mr President, I am glad that this evening we have the opportunity to discuss important amendments to the Structural Funds general regulation. These modifications are a substantial element of the common efforts at European and national level to overcome the consequences of the economic crisis. They are a logical continuation of the documents which we adopted last year. Then, as the rapporteur on the role of the cohesion policy for investment in the real economy, I called on the Council and Commission to work for simplification of the Structural Funds rules and thus facilitating access to these funds when they are more needed by the Member States. I am happy that Parliament’s main recommendations for further simplification have been taken on board. I am convinced that the new changes to the general regulations, simplifying some of the existing procedures, deserve our support. Reducing unnecessary administrative burden, red tape and unclear rules will contribute to more transparency, better control and fewer irregularities. This also means improved implementation and correct spending on EU money. Here is just one example. Through the amendment of Article 88, the Member States are further stimulated to detect and correct irregularities before they are found by the EU controlling institutions. In this case, the Member States will not lose the affected money but will be able to use them again for other projects within the relevant programme. The second group of amendments concern financial management rules. Advance payments for countries worst hit by the crisis will be increased for 2010. All Member States will receive more time to spend 2007-committed funds for projects which have not been approved or implemented within the deadlines. Both groups of measures are important because of their message to the beneficiaries and because of their practical utility. Anti-crisis measures are a clear demonstration of solidarity. They will bring fresh money for the Member States to get out of the crisis. All measures will commit realisation of more projects, especially now. This is crucial for the creation of jobs, investment and infrastructure and adaptation of workers and firms to the economic change. Both types of measures are useful and more valuable if they are implemented at the right time, but they are still awaiting final approval. Unfortunately, there was a huge delay in the Council for reaching an agreement when it was the leading body for the adoption of the amended regulation. I strongly believe that now, when Parliament has the same power as the Council, we will not postpone any more the approval and entry into force of these long-awaited and needed measures.

 Mr President, this is certainly not a nice reason for this debate. Madeira has been hit by an unbelievable natural disaster and we extend our condolences to the families affected. The European Union must provide support in this situation. The solidarity of the whole of the European Union is required here and I can only reiterate what has already been said. I urge the Commission to mobilise the Solidarity Fund as quickly as possible so that help can be provided. I would like to ask the Council to ensure that the reform of the Solidarity Fund that Parliament adopted two years ago is finally implemented, because this will make it possible to provide assistance more quickly to the regions affected. We also need to look to the future. In recent years, Madeira has received a lot of structural fund resources and will also continue to do so over the next few years. These resources need to be used to take preventative action so as to be able to reduce the terrible consequences of natural disasters and therefore also the suffering. This is something that, as the European Union, we need to implement in the regions and therefore also in Madeira. Constanze Angela Krehl,

Madam President, the Group of the Progressive Alliance of Socialists and Democrats in the European Parliament supports the initiative for the development of a strategy for the Danube Region. This is an important project to us, also because it strengthens, in an exemplary manner, territorial cohesion, which has been included for the first time in the Treaty of Lisbon, and may also provide an opportunity to make it clear exactly what we understand by territorial cohesion. I hope that Mr Rehn has also told the many partners he has spoken to that the European Parliament will be duly involved in drawing up the common strategy for the Danube Region. Unfortunately, I did not hear the words European Parliament in your speech, but we will duly take part in the debate. I am pleased that we are having the first major debate here in plenary today. In addition to territorial cohesion, it is also important to make it clear that this strategy involves cross-border cooperation, something that we are always encouraging and have always supported in the area of cohesion policy, and in fact already wanted to increase during this funding period. I hope that this will have even greater success in the next few years, including in connection with the Danube Strategy. I would like to point out that, with this Danube Strategy, we will attain European added value, which will be really tangible, particularly for the people living in this region. They should, therefore, be directly involved in drawing up the strategy and they should also be given the opportunity to witness this European project. My earnest request is that we do not overload and burden the strategy with too many priorities, but that we focus on what we want to achieve. In my opinion, it is very important that we use the existing resources more efficiently and that we build or expand warning systems, for example, and set them up appropriately to warn of natural disasters such as floods, but also to respond in the event of industrial accidents, for example, which result in the pollution of the Danube and neighbouring regions. Common areas of activity exist here. A successful Danube Strategy and successful projects in this region may also provide models for other regions. Without always having to immediately invent a new strategy, we can use this as an example for resolving problems together in cross-border European cooperation and – if we succeed in actually incorporating third countries into such a strategy – also for putting in place a Neighbourhood Policy, which is something that is important for all of us in the European Union and which should be promoted.

 Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, I would have liked to see a more exciting introduction to this topic, because I believe that the European cohesion policy must change after 2013. We are faced with quite different challenges than was the case 10 or 15 years ago. The focus for my group is on the fact that solidarity between the regions is not negotiable. On the one hand, this means that all the regions must have the opportunity to participate in the European Union cohesion policy and, on the other hand, it also means that we must oppose any attempt to renationalise the cohesion policy. We need a European approach which allows citizens to identify with the European Union. For us, there is no question that we also need to change. In the next few years, the spotlight will be on a discussion about prioritising the areas which will receive funding from the European cohesion policy. In future, we will not be able to subsidise everyone with European money. We must focus on establishing effective infrastructures, in particular, in the new Member States, and on developing research and innovation. Of course, we must also bear in mind that in future, the European cohesion policy will have to respond appropriately to challenges such as climate change, demographic change and globalisation. We also need to concentrate on urban development. This is not because I want to neglect rural areas, but because we know that 80% of citizens live in towns, cities and urban hinterlands and because rural development unfortunately does not form part of the cohesion policy at the moment, but is covered by agriculture policy. Our approach is to create stronger networks. I do not yet know whether this will work, but we must rise to the challenge. Importantly, support for people themselves also forms part of the cohesion policy and this is why I regret the fact that the Commissioner’s response was slightly evasive. For us, this means primarily education, training and qualifications for everyone from small children right through to the elderly. Life-long learning is an important concept. However, this also means that the European Social Fund (ESF) must continue to be integrated with the cohesion policy. There must be no thoughts of separating the ESF from the cohesion policy. Cross-border cooperation is very important to us. We want to strengthen this cooperation at the same time as simplifying the bureaucracy involved. Constanze Angela Krehl,  
on behalf of the S&amp;D Group.

Mr President, Mrs Malmström, ladies and gentlemen, I am delighted that the Swedish Presidency has put cooperation in the Baltic Sea area at the top of its agenda. There is no need for argument here: we need to protect resources and we, too, need to help protect the climate and nature. On the other hand, we must also focus cooperation in the Baltic Sea area on economic development, of that there can be no question. You have our full support here. However, some questions do still arise. You just said that there are no additional funds. As we discussed this in committee, all the funds are to be made available under the current cohesion policy. For me, this raises the question of whether this means under existing projects that are already being financed from cohesion resources or under new projects. If so, we need to ask which cohesion policy projects already approved will lose funding. This is a very important point, because I already know that the towns, local authorities and regions will come and ask me, what should we do in order to become involved in the Baltic Sea Strategy? How do we get the funds to run this sort of project? If we do not give them a good answer and cannot indicate how this cooperation is to be organised, then citizens’ enthusiasm for Baltic Sea cooperation will probably quickly turn to frustration. That is not the objective that we are working together to achieve and we therefore need to hold very intensive talks on how to organise this cooperation. I therefore ask – and I would ask the Commissioner to take this on board – that not only the Council and the Commission participate in the Baltic Sea Strategy, but also that Parliament is properly involved in this cooperation and in the implementation of this strategy, because we would like other regions to profit as well, as with the Black Sea policy or with cooperation between the states bordering the Danube. That would be very important to us. Dagmar Roth-Behrendt,  
rapporteur for the opinion of the Committee on Legal Affairs.

Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, where the Council and the Member States are concerned, I often have the feeling, well, I am often reminded of a monitor lizard. Monitor lizards have forked tongues. Perhaps that is too complex a metaphor for the Member States, so let me simply say that they have a split personality. They want to impose more and more new tasks on the European Union – and to some extent we support that with our priorities – but they are not willing to equip the EU with the capacities it needs, in terms of adequate personnel, to perform these tasks. I have heard our fellow Members talking about the different policy areas, such as agriculture, as Mr De Castro has mentioned, but also cultural policy, research, environmental policy, social policy and regional development. These are tremendously important areas for all of the Member States and for the regions which we represent. What strikes me, however, is what the Member States are not doing. They are not considering who is meant to do the work on all of these policies. Who is supposed to process the applications? Who will ensure that the projects are implemented properly and funding is channelled to where it is needed? For that to happen, we need enough staff, and these staff must be properly qualified, highly skilled employees. We need the very best people we can find! We need a multicultural workforce from many different European Union countries, with more geographical balance and outstanding language skills. What does the Council want? What do the Member States want? They want to make cuts here! Unless we have an appropriate financial framework for administrative expenditure, we will not be in a position to work on any policy areas at all. With that in mind, I urge you, President-in-Office, to ensure that the Commission’s proposal on the staff regulations is accepted so that we have an appropriate framework that enables us to carry out this work!

on behalf of the S&amp;D Group.

 Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, if we had been this timid during the BSE crisis fifteen years ago, when I was the chair of a committee, we would not have safe beef on which we can now rely. Fifteen years ago, it was self-evident that we would introduce an animal passport and that two ear tags would be mandatory. Today, we are once again hesitant. Do we really need crises in order to make the right decisions? The rapporteur said that this is not about public health, but that is precisely what this is about. This is about health policy, it is about public health. I admit that the introduction of a mandatory electronic identification system does, of course, involve a certain amount of expenditure and effort. I therefore proposed in committee that we should put forward a transitional period of 10 years. Even that, however, was too much for the majority of the committee. Do you want to face your electors earnestly and tell them that you take public health seriously? Not a single farmer would say that they could not achieve this given ten years. Let us turn now to voluntary labelling. In this connection, we have repeatedly said that what we want to do is to urge farmers to connect better with consumers and provide information in which consumers are interested. How old are the animals? How have they lived? How have they been fed? How were they reared? We are providing this option with the voluntary system. It is used in every Member State. The rapporteur is now proposing that we should remove the essential characteristics that provide conditions for how the system is to be operated. That would mean that there would be a system, but no conditions within it. Who seriously believes that something like that can actually work? Not a single national authority would be able to monitor these elements. No one can manage that. In other words, the aim is to destroy an existing system. Fortunately, the majority of the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Food Safety – and the rapporteur must represent that committee here, after all – decided to retain this voluntary system as it is. I would like to ask all my fellow Members to vote in favour of the amendments tabled by that committee when we vote on this tomorrow. Ladies and gentlemen, I do believe, however, that we could consider whether we can simplify this system from an administrative point of view. Then, however, we would have to simplify the system and remove the administrative obstacles and hurdles. We need to help the authorities, but the way proposed here is the wrong way to go. Ladies and gentlemen, I ask you urgently, including in the interests of the consumers and of the farmers of the European Union, to follow the lead of the decisions of the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Food Safety when it comes to voluntary labelling. Dagmar Roth-Behrendt  (S&amp;D

– Madam President, yes it is true that we need more money in the European budget to have programmes to educate about HIV/AIDS and to monitor it. But I wish to ask Ms Parvanova if she agrees with me that Member States are neglecting that disease and that we have different amounts of money spent in Member States – which is a shame, as we heard from Ms Childers – and that it would be necessary to ask the Commission to ask the Member States to show us how much money they spend on education programmes, how much money they spend on treating the disease, on hospices and on helping to eradicate this disease? It would be good if we could ask the new Presidency, the Danish Presidency, to deliver those numbers as soon as possible. Dagmar Roth-Behrendt  (S&amp;D

Madam President, Commissioner, medicinal products are one of the most important things that help people to get healthy, but, at the same time, they pose an enormous risk. Do you agree with me that our approach needs to be more harmonised? Do you agree with me that the ‘notified bodies’ in the Member States do not work well? Do you agree with me that the new legislation that you are going to bring forward over the next year must therefore ensure, on behalf of patients, that there is a body that checks in a uniform and harmonised way whether a medicinal product really is safe for patients? Do you further agree with me that it is necessary, for the wellbeing of patients in the European Union, for us to clearly define the use of any given product – whether on a one-off or repeated basis – and not to leave this in the hands of the industry.

 Mr President, I would have liked my fellow Members to have been slightly braver and to have gone for a second reading and then the conciliation procedure, whatever the Presidency in question. No front-of-pack labelling, no calorie information on the front, no indication at least of the calories in alcohol, never mind any other ingredients, no portion sizes at all, not a spoonful or a cup or anything else. The compromise includes none of these things. The country of origin information, which is something that consumers urgently need to know, is totally inadequate. The content of Article 25, like everything else, is linked to reports from the Commission on the status of the implementation of provisions: reports on trans fats, reports on products with one ingredient, reports on a whole range of other subjects. This really is a resounding failure. It is not a good result and it is very disheartening. I would have liked to have seen a proper second reading and then, if necessary, the conciliation procedure. That would have been a respectable result. Now European consumers will simply be disappointed. Dagmar Roth-Behrendt,

 Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I can no longer count the number of times over the past 14 or 15 years that I have spoken here in Parliament on subjects relating to bovine spongiform encephalopathy (BSE), transmissible spongiform encephalopathies (TSEs), animal health and, most importantly, consumer protection and human health. In 1997 I was the chair of the BSE committee and since then I have had the opportunity to speak perhaps 20, 30 or 40 times on the subject. We have a report here to discuss today and to vote on tomorrow, which concerns another Commission road map. At this point, I would like to thank the Commission, Mr Dalli and his colleagues once again for their cooperation. Over all the years that we have been dealing with BSE, this cooperation has been of a consistently high quality and I am grateful for this. However, this has not always been the case. If the situation in the 1980s and 1990s had been similar, we would have perhaps had fewer problems, but, thank goodness, things have changed over recent years. The road map contains essential technical sections, but it also has sections relating to the content which are important in political terms. I would like to refer to some of them, but I will not be able to cover all of them because of a lack of time. In all of the proposals which I am asking you to accept tomorrow, safeguarding the health of consumers is, of course, the highest priority. In recent years, we have introduced several amendments to the legislation on BSE and TSEs and, rightly so, when you consider that in 2001 we had 2 167 cases of animals with BSE in the European Union, while in 2009 the figure was only 67. This alone shows what a quantum leap forward has been taken in animal health and also in consumer protection. Tomorrow we will have to look at the question of whether we want to continue on this path. I have made a few proposals relating to the content which will also help us to continue reducing the risk of BSE and TSEs. However, I would like to focus here on one proposal and that is the question of the ban on feeding meat and bone meal to omnivores which are not ruminants, in other words, not sheep, goats and cattle. In 2001, in the light of the BSE crisis and the BSE scandal, a ban on feeding meat and bone meal to pigs and poultry in particular was introduced. At no point did this have any scientific basis; it was purely a political decision. At that time we had to admit that contaminated meat and bone meal had been fed to cattle. This was highly unethical because cattle are ruminants and herbivores and should not eat meat and bone meal. This contributed to the BSE crisis and, therefore, there was a complete ban on feeding meat and bone meal which also covered omnivores, in other words, animals which eat animal protein and, in particular, pigs and poultry. I would like to propose to you now, just as the Commission is doing, that we go back and say that if we can produce these products safely, then we must also be able to feed them. There is no point in us eating only about one third of an animal and not eating the rest of the animal which is fit for human consumption, but also not being allowed to reuse it to feed other animals. Therefore, we must amend this regulation. We are importing large quantities of protein crops, soya in particular, from the USA and Brazil, all of which have been genetically modified. That is not an acceptable alternative. We need our own high-quality, safe supply from within the European Union. The manufacturing method used must meet the relevant standards and we must also ensure that no cannibalism occurs. In other words, pigs must only eat meat and bone meal made from poultry and vice versa. The Commission can make sure that this is what happens. I hope that tomorrow, following the very positive cooperation, a large majority will be in favour of taking this next step towards returning the situation to normal. Dagmar Roth-Behrendt,  
rapporteur.
 – (DE)
 Madam President, in conclusion I would like to look at one point and that is the question of the feed ban which was introduced in 2001. I understand the fact that not all of you have been as closely involved with this subject over the last 15 years as I have. However, it is important for you to know that bovine spongiform encephalopathy (BSE) came about because illegal, undeclared feed containing processed ruminant protein was wrongly fed to cattle. In other words, sheep suffering from scrapie made their way into the meat and bone meal and this infected a similar species, namely another ruminant. This report, which I am sure you have all read, and this is directed at Mrs Grossetête, Mrs Rivasi and also Mrs Werthmann, specifically does not state that it will be possible to process ruminants to produce meat and bone meal. Ruminants are specifically excluded. Only pigs and poultry will be processed to make meat and bone meal. Even if the wicked farmers whom Mrs Rivasi mentioned actually exist and even if these nasty farmers do something illegal, in other words, feeding pig meat and bone meal to cattle, nothing would happen to the cattle. Therefore, and you can really believe me, because I will not do anything in relation to BSE and transmissible spongiform encephalopathies (TSEs) without thinking about it in great detail, I am calling on you once again to consider this carefully. Mr Häusling, Mrs Rivasi’s fellow Member, drafted an excellent report on the protein deficit in the European Union. We must not throw away other parts of animals that we eat because we cannot or do not want to process these parts which are fit for human consumption. This is what we did until 2001. The correct reaction at that time would have been to continue using meat and bone meal, but not to process cattle and sheep to produce it. That would have been the sensible solution. However, we rather overshot the mark and took our populist approach a little too far. Now it is time to correct this mistake. In the meantime, 10 years have passed and it is clear that meat and bone meal is a valuable source of protein, just as valuable as soya from Brazil and the USA and perhaps a better solution than creating monocultures in those countries and importing genetically modified plants into the European Union. I am calling on Parliament to take a unified stand tomorrow. I would ask you all to support my proposal. Dagmar Roth-Behrendt  (S&amp;D

 Mr President, Mr Dalli, your colleagues in the Directorate-General for Health and Consumers and yourself have done everything right. The same cannot be said of the German authorities. The least that we can say is that there is chaos when it comes to communications, and that, perhaps, is putting it mildly. The fact that Germany’s health minister yesterday thought it unnecessary to travel to a Health Council in Luxembourg where the main topic on the agenda was this serious infection crisis shows that he has absolutely no idea what Europe is really about and that he is ignorant, does not recognise the problems, or is still busy with internal party political crises. (Applause)
 What is more, I must observe – and Mr Dalli said it himself – that the German authorities clearly took the view that they would do without European Union experts, patronisingly and arrogantly believing that they had no need for them. Furthermore, the fact that it took three days for these experts to get into Germany is a scandal, and one that we must be critical of in this House. At the same time, however, we also have to say that it is our job, in the European Union, to warn consumers when there is a dangerous foodstuff on the market. I say to you quite clearly – if there are dangerous bacteria on a cucumber or a lettuce that do not lead to death, that may be a good thing, but for me it is not enough to justify a compensation case. Cucumbers from Spain and other countries did have EHEC bacteria on them. They were not the bacteria behind this outbreak, but it takes a while to find that out. For me, that is not the point, either. Those of you who understand the European Union and know the early warning system also know how the early warning system works. You know that, in the early warning system, the product and also the name of the producer must be named. You can also look that up easily in the legislation. For me, the important question is what will happen in future? In the future, we need to consider whether slurry use can continue. Could there still be production methods that are unacceptable? Who, in the European Union, actually monitors what, when and with what result this is documented, and who has what obligations in that regard? (Applause) President. − 
 Thank you very much. To those Members who wish to avail of the ‘catch-the-eye’ procedure, I would say that we already have approximately 20 speeches and that I do not believe we shall have enough time before the vote. However, you are still welcome to try. President.

 Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, we can all imagine the nightmare. Someone we know is ill and in a desperate situation. They are given medicines, but the medicines have no effect, because they have been falsified. We are grateful to the Commission for producing this proposal. It is true that we have been discussing it for some time. We began our debates in the previous parliamentary term and I would like to thank Mr Adamou, who is no longer a Member of this Parliament, for the preliminary work that he did on behalf of Mrs Matias. I believe that we have reached a good compromise, as Mrs Grossetête has said. Yes, we could have gone further. We are all impatient and we all want greater safety, but this is a good compromise. What have we achieved? We have made patient safety the central feature of the legislation. The safety measures that we have put in place will ensure that products are traceable throughout the entire distribution chain. Medicines can be traced from the manufacturer to the pharmacist. They will have an identifier which makes it immediately obvious if they are falsified or duplicated or if there are any irregularities, which can then be followed up. We have deliberately done this in such a way that the costs of the system remain at a reasonable level for everyone involved and that the system is not excessive. However, we are also not compromising on patient safety. This traceability is accompanied by the fact that the packaging must be undamaged, so that a patient who is given a pack can see that it has not been opened because it has an intact seal. In addition, there will be no more packs of medicines which are divided in two, as frequently used to be the case. All of this will improve safety levels and increase patients’ confidence. What else have we achieved? We have implemented an early warning system. This is excellent because it is the same system which has been in place for decades for foods and which we take for granted. There is an early warning system throughout the European Union for contaminated food. It is hard to believe that we have not had the same thing for medicines. If a falsified medicine is discovered, it is now possible to send out an early warning. The Member States must identify the patients who are affected, inform everyone involved and make sure that the risk involved in a medicine which is in circulation is made public. We take this for granted in the case of cars and food, but it has not been available so far for something as essential as medicines. As far as the Internet is concerned, anyone who accesses an illegal website must be able to recognise that it is illegal. This is why we must certify legal websites which, in future, will have a link to the website of the national approval body. They will be able to display a logo which will be developed by the European Commission. Everyone who buys medicines on the Internet can do so independently. They can tell whether they are dealing with a safe, legal website or an illegal one. All of this is a milestone, a quantum leap forward in patient safety. If we adopt this legislation tomorrow, we can be proud of what we have done and we should also make our achievements clear to the general public. President. −

 Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, this legislation is actually superfluous. I hope that it will continue to be superfluous because patients will not need to make use of it. In an ideal world, patients would receive the best healthcare most quickly in the country of their birth or the country where they live. The fact that we are discussing this today and adopting the legislation tomorrow is, as Mr Liese has rightly said, indicative of a cynical approach among the Member States. It means that the Member States have not recognised what they owe to their citizens, in other words, rapid, effective and high quality healthcare. It also shows that they would rather invest in other things than in these areas which provide services for their citizens and that is a disgrace. In addition, the negotiations in the Council on this subject are not something to be proud of. However, if this legislation is actually applied at some point, because patients need it, and that is not a good thing, I will be very pleased about what we have achieved. I am grateful to the rapporteur, Mrs Grossetête, and to my fellow Members for their cooperation. We have achieved a great deal. We have succeeded finally in putting the focus on rare diseases. People with these illnesses have always been sidelined and have found it difficult to obtain any treatment at all. We have at last managed to establish information points in the Member States which will inform people about their rights. There has been nothing of this kind available in the past. If reference networks are set up in future, it will finally be possible for the Member States to share best practices, information about gold and platinum standards and scientific progress. This has not been coordinated until now. There are some individual beacons of excellence, but no coordination. All of these things represent major successes, together with outpatient care and other areas which I will not go into now. Of course, there are also things that make me feel sad. I would have preferred not to have had the fuss and squabbling about prior authorisation, which simply shows that the Member States have not recognised the things that are really important. Fortunately, however, there are some Member States with which we can work well and we have demonstrated that today. Our objective must be to ensure that the healthcare system in every country is so good that no one wants to travel to another country whose language they do not speak. If what we are doing today and tomorrow is a small step towards this, because it will become clearer which countries have good services and which have poor services, which are doing something for their citizens and which are not, then we will have achieved a great deal. I hope that one of the minor side-effects of this will be transparency. We need to know which Member States have high standards and which are at a low level. I come from a country where I can feel relatively relaxed. However, I am aware of the problems of people in many other Member States and I feel ashamed about this, because it is not worthy of the European Union. I would like to thank the rapporteur for her hard work and, in particular, the Commission, Mr Dalli and his team, who have given the European Parliament and the father of this legislation in the previous parliamentary term, Mr Bowis, as much support as we could have wished for. I would also like to thank particularly the Belgian Presidency, which is not present today, but which has done everything possible to ensure that this process was successful. Although the Belgian Presidency did everything in its power, it could not always achieve a great deal, because of the sometimes stubborn, antediluvian attitudes of other Member States. However, something has been done and I believe that we will be able to vote in favour of this legislation tomorrow with a clear conscience. (Applause) President. − 
 Colleagues, just to let the speaker and everybody know what is happening, we now have three more people who want to ask a blue-card question. As this possibility has been introduced by the working group on parliamentary reform, I am very sympathetic to that and we have enough time, but nevertheless I have to ask the speaker if he will take all those questions. Then I would ask everybody whether we can take the questions in turn and then ask Mr Hökmark to answer. We will then finalise that part of the speaking time. President. − 
 Mr Swoboda, I fully support what you have said. It is very rude and lacking in respect. Mr De Rossa, a point of order? President.

 Mr President, let us approach this whole process rather more calmly. Usually, the Vice-Presidents of Parliament are elected in a block at the start of the legislative period or in the course of the legislative period. When we do that, fellow Members, we only ever find out the number of ‘Yes’ votes cast for a candidate – which also decides the order in which Members are elected to the Bureau. Now, because a Member has left, we are voting in one more Vice-President today – so the only important thing is whether he has received the number of ‘Yes’ votes required for election. Anything else makes no difference. It is different to other votes. (Applause)
 The President of Parliament has given a perfect description of the secret ballot, and it worked beautifully for me without my having to press various buttons. I pressed the button that I wanted to press and the blue light appeared. Perhaps we could simply all try it together once more, Mr President. (Applause) President.

Unfortunately, the Commissioner in question was not able to be with us on time, which I find regrettable, as there is no ash cloud at the moment and as it is already 11.00.

 Mr President, Mr Barroso, our circumstances are different and we have a different institutional structure. Now that the Treaty of Lisbon is in place, the three institutions – Parliament, the Council and the European Commission – will have to work together in a different way to how they have done up to now. I believe that we all need to be interested in making this a success. Your involvement in the first part of the interinstitutional agreement gives me the impression – and I am not always uncritical of you – that you want this, too. The first part of this agreement that we have negotiated with you contains important elements for the role of the European Parliament in our cooperation with you, in particular, but also with the Council. These elements are the strengthening of the dialogue between Parliament and the European Commission, the possibility of receiving more information than we have done in the past, in other words, to be able to be an equal partner in the legislative process, and a genuine question time in which commissioners, who are, ultimately, politicians, come here and answer questions and give speeches and responses, without hiding away as they have done in the past. Previously, only you, Mr Barroso, had the courage to do that. Now, all of them will do so. That is a good thing. It will benefit all of us, and it will also be beneficial for European democracy and, hopefully, also for the interest of citizens in what we do, namely our legislative work for everyone. Finally, Mr Barroso, with regard to the question of legislative initiative, I firmly believe that, with what we were able to achieve in the negotiations with you regarding our cooperation and what we have today shaped into a resolution, we have come as close to the right of initiative for the European Parliament as we possibly can. It furthermore rules out the sui generis
 construct. You worked with us on this and you worked earnestly on it. I respect that and very much appreciate how you have contributed to this. The impact assessments have already been mentioned by other Members. You have undertaken to make this transparent and to act in a cooperative manner. You said that social impact assessments are important to you. That is an essential point from our perspective. I am completely happy with this. I believe that we should begin the work today, and not before time. President.  
– I would remind the Members once again that the Blue Card system created by the Working Party on Parliamentary Reform does not apply to the Commission and the Council, but only to debates amongst Members of this House. A motion for a resolution to close this debate has been tabled by the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Food Safety(1)
. The debate is now closed. The vote will take place tomorrow. President.  
– Thank you very much, Mrs Gräßle. As you are addressing the Commission directly, I would encourage the Commissioner to listen closely to what you have to say. That makes it much easier to answer afterwards. President.  
– Thank you very much, Commissioner Šemeta. There were a few more questions from the Members, but it is my understanding that you do not want to answer Mr Garriga and the other Members directly. Perhaps you would like to get your answers to the Members in question in writing. They would certainly appreciate that enormously. Mrs Gräßle, Mr Garriga and numerous other Members have asked additional questions. President.

 Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, to take Ms Schaldemose’s example, if we imagine that we had a USB stick and every computer had a different access port, we would all have to buy different adaptors. This example alone shows how important standardisation is and the great extent to which it can make life easier for citizens. This is a very important issue that we have to debate here. We, in Parliament, have also succeeded in adding many improvements to the Commission’s text. I would therefore like to offer my sincere thanks to the rapporteur and to our shadow rapporteur for their outstanding work. There were, however, two points – to single out just a couple of topics, for time reasons – that were particularly close to our hearts. First of all, we had the support for small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs) – which was a very important point for us – and ensuring that standardisation is not only the realm of large companies, but also respects the needs of SMEs. In cases like this, the risk is, of course, always very large that the large companies will go ahead and implement and the small companies will have to catch up, which can be a cost-intensive exercise. We have also managed to ensure that the support and the funding in this area have been safeguarded. The second area that was important to us was the removal of a section of the services that have recently been incorporated into this process, in particular, the removal of services of common economic interest and those of major importance to the professions. In this area, standardisation could be very dangerous, as these are fields that depend on creativity and the flexibility of service providers, and these must be safeguarded. We have reached a satisfactory compromise in this regard, and one in favour of which we, as a group, feel able to vote. As I said, though, there was a lot of work to do and I hope that things will be somewhat easier from here on in. Evelyne Gebhardt,  
rapporteur for the opinion of the Committee on the Internal Market and Consumer Protection.

 Mr President, we were very disappointed, Mr Barnier, to find that, in contrast to what was announced in the work programme for 2011, there was no legislative proposal, but merely a recommendation to the Member States. Therefore, I very much welcome the fact that today, you are showing your determination to submit a legislative proposal by the autumn at the latest, I hope, because we all know that calls to the Commission simply do not achieve anything. A total of 30 million citizens are waiting to have access to a basic account, so that they can perform the fundamental tasks that are part of life in today’s society. These 30 million citizens are seasonal workers, people on low incomes, the homeless and students, and all of them have a right to a bank account. We need to make sure that they get one. The basic account must also be cost-effective. We must not allow these people to be excluded again because of the cost, because they have no address or for some of the other reasons that are often given. We must ensure that they have a right to a bank account, because we cannot accept a situation in our society where there are first and second class citizens. For this reason, I very much hope that you will be able to persuade the College of Commissioners very quickly. We will help you, Mr Barnier, to make sure that the Member States ultimately also agree, because these really are fundamental rights. Evelyne Gebhardt  (S&amp;D
). 
 – (DE) 
Mr President, Commissioner, Mr Creutzmann, I believe that we are facing a very important issue here, and one that must be solved, regulated. I therefore very much welcomed it when the Commission brought forward this legislative proposal. This is about the safety of our citizens. We have obtained a great deal of information about how problematic counterfeit products are for people’s health and well-being, but also for pricing, and how important it is for businesses to be able to sell products that they have actually produced, in which connection it goes without saying that intellectual property rights must be properly protected. There are, however, a few issues that are still subject to fierce debate within Parliament. One such issue seems to have been resolved to some extent, and in that regard I would like to offer my sincere thanks to Ms Hedh, who produced great work in connection with generic medicines. The transiting issue is an absolutely essential issue in this context. We cannot accept the introduction of obstacles here that actually have nothing to do with the protection of intellectual property but relate to entirely different issues. We need to very carefully weigh up what we do in this area. Otherwise, Ms Hedh provided a very clear picture of what problems result in this context. The second point, which we believe to be very important – and, in this regard, I was very pleased by what you had to say earlier in respect of patent infringements, Mr Šemeta – is that the rule of law must be safeguarded in all cases. For that reason, if two of the amendments tabled by our group are not adopted, we as a group will not ultimately be able to vote in favour of the Creutzmann report, as we want there to be legal certainty here, but also that the rule of law and the rights of citizens in this connection should be safeguarded. It is therefore not all the same to us how the final vote goes. Our final vote tomorrow is therefore actually still in the balance. Evelyne Gebhardt,  
on behalf of the S&amp;D Group.

 Mr President, Commissioner, on the 20th anniversary of the internal market, the issue of the internal market really deserves the attention we are giving it today. It is one of our great achievements that we can move freely in the European Union, that we can sell our goods throughout Europe, that we have a high degree of product safety, and that we can bring citizens together here in this House, and it is a delight that we are working on it. It is therefore important, Mr Barnier, that you continue on the path you have embarked upon so as to ensure, together with us, that the positive aspects of the internal market are brought closer to citizens and that they recognise what they have gained from the European internal market. That is something that is missing, that citizens do not recognise, because we talk too much about problems and not enough about the achievements of the European Union. It is therefore also important that we concentrate more on what we have enshrined in Article 3 of the Treaty of Lisbon, which is that we want to have and also need a social market economy – and I place particular emphasis on the word ‘social’ – so that workers and consumers recognise themselves in Europe. I would also like to praise what Louis Grech highlighted in his report by adopting an holistic approach, which we need so that we can really see the internal market as a global concept and not as disconnected small actions that run alongside each other, and with which a philosophy of Europe is truly associated. It is really important to work on this together and we should continue to do so. The internal market is good, but there is one thing we should not forget: it must be structured for the benefit of citizens and not just for the benefit of enterprises and the financial world.

 Madam President, good levels of cooperation with the Member States of the European Economic Area (EEA) and the European Free Trade Association (EFTA) are very important to us. We enjoy a privileged relationship, which we wish to develop further in a highly positive way. However, this also means that both sides must adhere to existing agreements and, as the European Parliament and as Europeans, we must take care to ensure that no discrimination between the Member States of the European Union is allowed to creep in, whether in the interpretation of the wording of agreements, or in any other way. That is why I fail to understand the approach taken by the Swiss in applying the quota provisions that Switzerland is entitled to impose under the agreements. What we find unacceptable is that a distinction is made between Member States, in other words between the citizens of eight Member States of the European Union and the remaining States of the Union. This runs counter to the spirit of the European Union. We are all equal and must all be treated equally. That is why we cannot accept a distinction in this case. The provisions of Article 10 of the 1999 Agreement relate to employed and self-employed persons from the European Community. This is stated clearly in the agreements and we must insist that all citizens of the European Community are dealt with equally. This is the reason for our question to the European Commission regarding the status of discussions in this area with Switzerland. We would also ask you to clarify that we do not have first and second class citizens in the European Union and that the quota provision must apply to the European Community as a whole and that no distinction between citizens is permitted.

 Mr President, as there is a certain amount of confusion in my group with regard to what we are actually voting on here, I would like to point out that we are talking about a reference to the WARF judgment by the European Patent Office in which we want the whole of the technical theory behind the application to be taken into account. It is not about stem cells – they have absolutely nothing to do with this resolution. Evelyne Gebhardt,  
on behalf of the S&amp;D Group.

 Mr President, Mr De Gucht, this is an extremely important discussion. Of course, we are all in favour of inventions being patented and of protecting new products in a way that genuinely benefits the people who have invented them. However, when it comes to breeding methods in biological fields, we need to consider very carefully what actually constitutes an invention and what is just a discovery or a development of a natural breeding method. That is one of the questions which arises in the context of patenting. There are some cases, including tomatoes and broccoli, where we have to ask ourselves in which direction the Convention on the Grant of European Patents is moving. Mr De Gucht, you have yourself just admitted that, as far as patentability and the implementation and interpretation of the law in this field are concerned, there are some grey areas. It is precisely these grey areas we are referring to when we say that we need to think about how we handle this issue. We must ensure that the wide range of different varieties and breeds that we have in the European Union and the varied breeding methods, all of which have their own value, are not destroyed by patent claims that are too far-reaching. We must also ensure that small and medium-sized businesses can continue to develop and exercise their breeders’ privilege and that this is not ruined by granting patents which will prevent this privilege from being applied and which will no longer allow these businesses to make free use of the natural material that is readily available. This is one of the points that concerns us and we are asking the Commission, Mr De Gucht, to focus its attention on this area and to evaluate to what extent the bans which we imposed in the directive on the legal protection of biotechnological inventions, and which involved heated debates at the time, are really being respected. The principle that what the European Patent Office has laid down, in other words, that not only the explicit wording of the claims but also the overall technical theory behind the application needs to be considered, must be applied and respected. Evelyne Gebhardt,

Mr President, Commissioner, consumers experience a great deal of uncertainty when they go into shops and see a locally produced product. No one knows what that actually means. Does it actually come from somewhere local or is the yoghurt that is claimed to be local perhaps produced using milk that had first been transported a thousand kilometres? Is that what we as consumers want? It is time that we clarified what is actually meant by the term ‘locally produced’. Many citizens would like to know that. This is not because they want to pursue food nationalism, but because they take protection of the climate and the environment seriously, and they say: these natural products that I am buying today do not need to come from a long distance away when they can also be produced locally, and I would prefer that. These things are important. We want clarity so that responsible citizens can also take responsible decisions. After all, what does it mean to be able to take responsible decisions? It means receiving the information that you need to formulate the decision accordingly. These are things that we need to clarify. The Commission has, in fact, started to consider this matter. I would be very grateful, Commissioner, if you could tell us by when we can expect action to be taken by the Commission. When will we potentially also have legislative proposals on the table with which we will be able to provide citizens with an answer to these pressing questions? It is not a question of preventing products from coming from other countries. I always look forward to the delicious products from Spain that I can buy in Germany, because they cannot be produced in Germany. However, there are also products that are produced locally. It is important for us to ensure that citizens know where a product comes from, what the quality of the product is, and that there is not always a riddle associated with it in terms of how the information should be interpreted, what the quality label that they see means, and whether it actually has any value or any real meaning. This is the legal certainty that we want for our citizens. Evelyne Gebhardt  (S&amp;D

 Mr President, Commissioner Barnier, as rapporteur for the Services Directive, I did ensure, at that time, that services of common economic interest and services of general interest were excluded from the scope of that directive. At the same time I said that it is absolutely necessary for these services to be regulated at European level in order to protect them. Since then, we have seen the advent of the Treaty of Lisbon and its supplementary Protocol No 26, which gives the Commission a duty. Commission President Barroso promised us that he would act in this regard and we await real and substantial action from the Commission in this area. My question for you, Commissioner, is: when can we expect a legislative text from you? This is something that is needed, in my opinion. It is needed not because we want to regulate these services, but because we want to ensure that these services continue to remain in the hands of the competent people and bodies in the Member States, and with the highest possible level of quality. Evelyne Gebhardt  (S&amp;D
). 
 – (DE)
 Mr President, with respect, Commissioner, I do not see this the same way as you. What you have just presented is a breakdown of the legislation, and not the implementation of what is stipulated under Protocol No 26 of the Treaty of Lisbon, which quite clearly sets out that we need a legislative framework within which the protection of these services of general economic interest is to be regulated. That is something quite different to what you just presented to us I would like to know when you actually intend to implement the Treaty on European Union. Evelyne Gebhardt,

Madam President, the Committee on the Internal Market and Consumer Protection has also deliberated in detail on the Single Euro Payments Area, or SEPA, because this issue is very much concerned with consumer protection. I can state that I am very happy with the compromise reached, because it also incorporates some of the topics adopted by us in committee. It is a very good thing that we can say to consumers that we are thinking of them, too, in the area of the financial markets, because they do not always get that impression. Borders for payment transactions are borders in Europe. It is time that these were removed, so that they no longer stand in the way of European mobility. I very much welcome the fact that it has been established that, in future, all enterprises and consumers will be able to make euro payment transactions in other European countries from a single account at any bank. This is very important, particularly for small and medium-sized enterprises. Not just for enterprises, though, but also for consumers who are mobile, who go on holiday and who want to make credit transfers. It is also very good that we have ensured that there is a single migration date for credit transfers and direct debits. It would not have been good for consumers to have two different dates, as that would have resulted in greater confusion. Clarity and legal certainty – that is what we need, and that is what we have achieved here. My third and last point concerns the information given to citizens. That is also extremely important. A great many of them are afraid of this new SEPA number, of the new IBAN code, because it seems too long to them. If we tell them quite clearly how it is composed, however, then they will not find it so difficult and complicated at all. In other words, it is very important that we have an information campaign so that people know what this is all about. Evelyne Gebhardt,

 Mr President, Commissioner, the forum in Kraków really was a great success. This needs to be repeated, because good initiatives really ought to be continued. In this connection, I would like once again to thank Mr Grech, who as we know had the original idea that we should present the 20 most important concerns of citizens at such a forum. That was the key element of what we did, namely to place the concerns of citizens at the forefront so that they can see that the single market is not something abstract, but something that will actually provide them with added value. It concerned such diverse issues as the recognition of professional qualifications, the opportunity for young people to open a bank account in another Member State – which is sometimes very difficult – legal certainty in connection with online shopping, the Posting of Workers Directive, which urgently needs to be updated and amended, the strengthening of small and medium-sized enterprises and so on. Many subjects were discussed and the relevant problems highlighted. Commissioner, in future we need to put greater emphasis on the solutions on offer. In this regard, we await everything that you as the Commission have promised for next year, and Parliament and my group, the Group of the Progressive Alliance of Socialists and Democrats in the European Parliament, will monitor what you present to us with a very critical, but positive eye. Evelyne Gebhardt  (S&amp;D
). 
 – (DE) 
Madam President, the streamlining of the law in this area of mutual recognition of professional qualifications is extremely important. After all, we want policies that are in the best interests of our citizens. We all want our citizens to be able to move about freely and pursue their careers throughout the European Union. There are still far too many problems and obstacles raised by the Member States, as well as difficulties posed by European law, and it is important that we should tackle this issue. I am grateful to Mr Barnier, however, because he has stated that the answer does not necessarily lie in the deregulation of regulated professions. Those who favour such a move still have not indicated which professions they would like to see deregulated. I would like to know: are they talking about doctors, engineers or architects? I am not sure. What I am sure about is that regulation is extremely important and necessary. With regard to the professional card: this is something that would allow our citizens genuine freedom of movement, which is why we should not spend too much time on analysis, but instead should respond to the need expressed by those affected. Engineers and doctors were the first to say that they needed something like this to be able to move more freely around Europe, which is, after all, a political union. It is for this reason that we must say yes to this, and do so as quickly as possible. Evelyne Gebhardt  (S&amp;D
).

 Madam President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, public procurement is an extremely important task that we have for the future. I very much welcome the fact that the European Commission intends not only to improve legal certainty, but also to put right some aspects that have gone wrong. I would also like to thank the rapporteur, Ms Rühle, for having included a couple of points that are extremely important to those of us who are members of the Group of the Progressive Alliance of Socialists and Democrats in the European Parliament. Firstly, there is the issue that we must ensure that the rights of workers are safeguarded and that social criteria enjoy a prominent place. That is very important to us, because global sustainability includes ensuring that we do not generate poverty tomorrow but that instead, when awarding contracts, we also ensure that reasonable prices are paid, enabling us to protect the lives of workers. Another important point for us was, and remains, the fact that subcontractors are treated in exactly the same way as contractors – so that when contracts are awarded to contractors, the criteria cannot then be set aside because their subcontractors do not have to adhere to them. This is not a pipe dream, but rather it is a point that is very important to us: ensuring that legal certainty is brought about in this respect, so that we can genuinely make sure that public procurement remains transparent and comprehensible to the public, and so as to ensure fair competition between enterprises – particularly where small and medium-sized enterprises are concerned. Far from being inappropriate criteria, therefore, these are criteria that are extremely important. Evelyne Gebhardt  (S&amp;D
).

 Madam President, Mr Oettinger, the Commission shares the European Parliament’s concerns. This is very nice, but we have been waiting for years for the Commission to take action and to make some genuine progress in this area. We have Mr Busuttil’s report in front of us. In the last parliamentary term, the Committee on the Internal Market and Consumer Protection repeatedly highlighted the fact that we finally need to do something to help people. The problem is that people are still waiting for this help to arrive. Many of the small voluntary organisations that are affected do not have the financial means or the chutzpah to defend themselves. Only last week I received another letter asking: ‘How can I defend myself? I do not have the money for a lawyer, so I cannot take legal proceedings’. I believe that we must finally give the citizens of Europe an effective means of ridding themselves of this problem. Evelyne Gebhardt,  
on behalf of the S&amp;D Group.

 Mr President, I very much hope that it will be possible to rescue the 200 people who are in distress, because this is a very important matter. Thank you for informing us about this. Mr Barnier, Mrs Győri, ladies and gentlemen, Article 3 of the Treaty of Lisbon, which enshrines the social market economy, represents a new approach and a new political task for the future. Of course, we now have to complete this task and we have been waiting to do so for the last two years. I am pleased that the European Commission has made the first move in this direction. I am also very pleased that we in the Group of the Progressive Alliance of Socialists and Democrats in the European Parliament have succeeded, after a hard struggle, in ensuring that the social clause is included in the European Parliament’s position when we vote on this issue today. This is a very important question, because it forms the basis for social cohesion and will enable us to ensure that the internal market is regarded by people in the European Union as a social component. This is essential if we want the citizens of Europe to regain their trust in the political system in the European Union. In particular, the Commission must finally acknowledge the decisive significance of social rights in the internal market and put the focus on the social impact of European legislation. This is why it is important for Parliament to remind the Commission once again about the social clause which is enshrined in the Treaty of Lisbon. I would like to thank Mr Barnier for assuring us that he will take this into consideration and will follow this route. He can be sure of the full support of the Group of the Progressive Alliance of Socialists and Democrats in the European Parliament. Mr Barnier, the social clause also means, of course, that the Posting of Workers Directive must be revised accordingly. It means that the right to work and to strike must be respected in the Member States, together with the issues which really concern people, and that these rights must be incorporated into the internal market policy of the European Union without any ifs and buts and without restrictions. That is what concerns us as Social Democrats. If the internal market is developed on this basis, we will give you our support and our policy will be moving in the right direction. Of course, other questions are also important in this context. The recognition of professional qualifications, the European qualifications passport and the full transferability of pensions within the European Union are all issues which interest the citizens of Europe and which will ensure that the internal market is a market for the people. This is exactly what we Social Democrats are always saying. The economy is there for the people and not vice versa. If we follow this path, then we will be on the right track. Evelyne Gebhardt  (S&amp;D
).

 Mr President, I support the proposal by the Group of the European People’s Party (Christian Democrats), as it makes perfect sense to discuss this. I would just ask – in agreement with the coordinator of the Committee on the Internal Market and Consumer Protection, Mr Schwab – that we do not vote on the resolution this week, but wait until May to do so, because we have not yet had time to discuss this among the groups. Thus, I would say ‘yes’ to the inclusion of this item on the agenda, ‘yes’ to a resolution, but I would like the vote on the resolution to wait until May. Evelyne Gebhardt  (S&amp;D
). 
 – (DE)
 Mr President, I asked that the vote on the resolution on public procurement be postponed until May, which, of course, means that the deadline for the submission of resolutions and amendments would then also be postponed accordingly. You have not given us a chance to vote on that yet. Evelyne Gebhardt,  
on behalf of the S&amp;D Group.
 – (DE)
 Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, we did indeed experience some very tough negotiations, Mr Schwab, as opinions were very divided at the start of discussions. Likewise, it was not easy to decide on a reasonable course of action. However, these negotiations did succeed in achieving significant improvements, even after the vote at committee level, which finally made it possible for my group to vote in favour of this compromise package tomorrow. After all the discussions we have held, you will be aware of how much this means. We have indeed made a number of improvements. Accordingly, the fundamental principle followed in the directive is now, once again, minimum harmonisation – with the exception of the areas that are to be fully harmonised, which was an important concern for us. We excluded social services, healthcare services and games of chance from the scope of this directive because these are the areas that require special regulation. You cannot apply the same principles to them as to commercial services, commodities or retailing and so this was an important consideration. We have significantly strengthened the obligations to provide information to our citizens, the consumers. For this reason I would like to make it clear to the President-in-Office of the Council that the idea of dropping Chapter 2, in other words removing exactly the areas where this obligation to provide information is to apply, is something that the Group of the Progressive Alliance of Socialists and Democrats in the European Parliament will not tolerate. We have included electronic products in the scope of the directive, something not envisaged in the Commission’s original proposal. However, distance selling via the Internet is one of the key areas that has been included. As we reached the home straight, we also succeeded in improving the provisions on door-to-door selling. These are positive improvements that have enabled us to lend our support. I cannot deny that a few problems still exist, in particular the clauses relating to unfair contract terms in Chapter 5. We are very dissatisfied with these provisions and will either have to do some more work here or, if necessary, omit this section entirely. However, something that causes even more difficulty is the fact that financial services have been completely excluded from the obligations to provide information. I think we have a serious problem here. We will have to discuss this further, Commissioner, because financial services were included in your proposals and this should remain the case. To summarise: we will vote in favour of the compromise package and will also vote to refer the directive back to committee, but this does not mean that we agree to adopt the directive at first reading. Evelyne Gebhardt,  
rapporteur.

 Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, here in the European Parliament, we have been debating the Services Directive for a long time, and we have expressed many concerns in our debates about how it should be implemented and how we can ensure that service providers have free movement within the European Union. This was an important piece of policy. That is why we, as Parliament, decided that we not only wanted to make the legislation, but that we also wanted to monitor how the Services Directive is actually transposed in the Member States. It is in our interest that the directive be transposed properly, correctly and well. The European Commission also agreed to help us in this regard. I would therefore like to thank Commissioner Barnier, who has provided us with valuable information in this connection. We have particular concerns about four specific areas, namely, the evaluation procedure, the points of single contact, administrative cooperation and the scope of the directive. On the first point, I have the following to say. Mutual evaluation is one of the core items where we, as Parliament, and I, as the then rapporteur, said actually, we are opposed to this, as this means an awful lot of bureaucracy in the Member States. I am also hearing from the Member States today that there are indeed complaints about the bureaucracy. In that regard, however, I would quite simply like to make it very clear to the Member States once again that they were the ones that wanted this, not Parliament! They inserted it into the legislation and, as such, they should take the responsibility for it themselves even if, for example, local communities are beginning to discuss what Europe has done to them again. On the question of the second point – the points of single contact – I would say that this is the answer to what we have done in the political sense. We said quite clearly that the principle of the Services Directive is not the country of origin principle but the country of destination principle. That means that service providers must respect the law of the State in which they operate. That makes it all the more important that they obtain from the points of single contact not only the information about the laws that they have to respect, but also the necessary assistance to enable them to really apply that law properly and consistently in the Member States. I therefore find it very regrettable that, while these points of single contact have been set up in many Member States – although not all of them as yet – this has only been done in a very unsatisfactory way. In some cases, they are merely Internet portals. That does not satisfy us, the European Parliament – there needs to be much more behind these points of single contact. There need to be people behind them who can provide real assistance for the service providers in this area. One issue here is the language that is provided. It is not enough to offer the local language and perhaps English. In my view – and Parliament has spoken in similar terms – it is important for service providers that the language of the neighbouring county is also spoken. I say this with one eye on our Polish President – in the border area between Germany and Poland, German should be offered in Poland and Polish in Germany so that the information and assistance are actually really good, so that even the small businesses, which are not all competent in English, can really get involved in cross-border activities. Administrative cooperation is another important point and it is an area where we are heading in the right direction. In this regard, the Member States still have an awful lot more to do in the area of cooperation and of the education and training of officials, so that this system can be really well used. Finally, we come to the scope, in which connection I would like to make it quite clear, once again, that we excluded all services of common economic interest from the scope of Article 16. I expect the Member States to respect that. If they want to include these services in the scope of the Services Directive, that is their right, but in that case, they must not sweep it all up as part of the Services Directive; rather, it is their own political statement of intent and something that they should also assume responsibility for themselves. That is what I demand of the Member States in this context. Evelyne Gebhardt,  
rapporteur.
 – (DE)
 Mr President, this debate was very interesting and illuminating. There was one observation I have to make, though, and that was that there are still people who continue to have in their heads the old Bolkestein proposal, which actually provided for liberalisation and deregulation, despite the fact that that really is a thing of the past and that the Services Directive, as constituted at present, is about enabling people to use their qualifications to offer services across the European Union. That is what this Services Directive is about, and it is important to keep saying so. I would like to stress that once again and we have also made that change quite clear. In addition, I would also like to remind you all that we absolutely do have a social clause in the Services Directive. This is because we have included, in Article 1, a clause whereby the labour and social law of the Member States cannot be jeopardised by the application of the Services Directive. Thus, if something like that were to happen in a Member State – and I did say this at the beginning – that would be an incorrect implementation of the Services Directive. If you want to speak of the Rüffert case and others, that has no relevance to the Services Directive. Such cases relate to the Posting of Workers Directive and its implementation and to the public procurement directives. Please do not fall into the trap of comparing apples and oranges. While apples and oranges perhaps both produce a good fruit stew, that is completely the wrong approach to take in politics. We therefore really need to very closely monitor what happens. I repeat my call for us to ensure that the Services Directive is correctly transposed in the Member States and not used to take rights away or to deregulate – that is not the job of the Services Directive. Of course, it remains a quite clear demand for us that we in the European Union in any case need a legal framework to protect services of general economic interest. I am eager to see what the Commission will produce for us in this regard. Evelyne Gebhardt,  
on behalf of the S&amp;D Group.

 Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, I would like to express my very sincere thanks to the rapporteur, Mrs Stihler, who has done some very important work in this highly technical area. It is not only a technical report that we have before us; it is also a highly political report – a report in which high political standards also had to be respected. It was necessary to balance the various interests of industry, safety and the protection of workers, and, in the view of the European Parliament and the Group of the Progressive Alliance of Socialists and Democrats in the European Parliament, the rapporteur has succeeded admirably in doing this. It was essential to respect the interests of the industry and to see where their problems are in this area of construction products. It was also important to find a balance between the large and the small and medium-sized enterprises. Our view was that the Commission was right to suggest that small enterprises need fewer rules. However, that does not mean – and this is where the Commission’s proposal was improved upon – that a lower level of safety should be permitted. The level of the standards must also be genuinely high, something that we managed to achieve in this area. Of course, it is also important to place safety at the forefront. This is of particular importance for consumers because, where a construction product is manufactured and installed, it must be ensured that the user of the product is ultimately just as safe as those who worked with it beforehand. The third point that was particularly important to us, as Social Democrats, was improving worker protection and the fact that this has also been explicitly incorporated once again. Mrs Stihler also attached a great deal of importance to this in her remarks. After all, these construction products often involve work with hazardous substances and materials. It is extremely important to ensure that the highest possible level of protection is indeed achieved in this area. This level of protection will also need to be considered later – and that is something that we probably still need to work on, Mr Tajani – in connection with the disposal of these products once they are no longer needed. I would like to thank the rapporteur most sincerely once again for her truly splendid work. Evelyne Gebhardt,  
on behalf of the S&amp;D Group.

 Mr President, Commissioner, I would like to express my thanks to Mrs Weisgerber for the truly collegial collaboration that we enjoyed. I would like to say, on behalf of my group, that I am far from euphoric about the repeal of these eight directives. There are, in fact, a number of outdated measuring instruments for which the rules and regulations are being abolished, but we have noted in the debates that the devil is in the detail, as you yourself have said. It therefore was not always clear whether this route really was the right one to choose. My group will vote in favour of this compromise in light of the fact that we have obtained an assurance from the Commission that it will examine the idea of properly incorporating these measurement instruments into the European Measuring Instruments Directive (MID), which is, of course, being drawn up at the moment, where necessary. This commitment to investigate – this, too, I am assuming – will also be taken very seriously and given earnest consideration. We are voting for the compromise on this condition, well aware that there are still one or two issues that need to be investigated. As for the correlation tables, I would like to say, at this point, that we have now stated that we are ready to accept the mild wording that is currently to be found in this text but that this is one of the last documents in which we have accepted this, as, for us, this really is about European law, which is created once the Member States have given their consent, being truly and properly implemented. We can only check that, however, if we have the information, and we only get the information from these correlation tables. We will continue to work towards that, at all events. Evelyne Gebhardt,

 Mr President, year after year, we have this debate about the safety of toys. Year after year, we have to observe that there is still much that is in need of improvement. We are talking, here, amongst other things, about what are known as carcinogenic, mutagenic and reprotoxic substances (CMRs), substances that cause cancer and that may be very hazardous to the health and, in some cases, even the life of children. The new information does indeed show that we need to ensure that the limit values are adapted and we are calling on the Commission to finally do so. Commissioner, I really hope that this will actually happen. This is not the only problem, however. There is another problem in the shape of market supervision, and the Member States, too, have a responsibility here. They have a responsibility to ensure that only toys that truly satisfy the safety standards that we have adopted reach the market. That is not always the case, which is highly regrettable. We therefore need to ensure that these safety standards are improved. The third and final point that I wish to make relates to the marking of toys. Many people wrongly believe that the CE mark is an indicator of safety. It is not, however, as the Commission itself says. It is therefore time, Commissioner, that the Commission gave some thought to how we could issue a European safety mark that is truly reliable and that is monitored by third parties, independent authorities or bodies, so that a dangerous toy simply cannot make it onto the market or into the shops where it can threaten the health of our children. I believe that we have a major debt to discharge in this regard, and there is still much that we need to do, and urgently so. Evelyne Gebhardt  (S&amp;D

– (DE)
 Mr President, Mr Barroso, ladies and gentlemen, I believe that we have made major progress on behalf of the citizens of Europe with the Treaty of Lisbon, because we have included the social market economy among the principles of European policy. It is clear that we as Europeans and as parliamentarians expect the social market economy to be turned into a reality. Now we are looking at the internal market itself and the issues relating to the internal market as a whole and we can see that some of the things which should have been included have been omitted. It is not enough to carry out social impact assessments of European legislation. We need a social clause to be put into practice, so that the promises which were made that the citizens would really benefit from Europe are fulfilled and do not simply remain on paper. This is not just about the social clause, but also about important issues such as the services of general economic interest, which require special protection. It is very important to me that the European Commission finally addresses this question and looks more closely at issues concerning workers than was necessary, for example, in the context of the Posting of Workers Directive, where we are still waiting to find out what will happen next. Finally, and now I am slowly starting to get really annoyed, we have been calling on the European Commission for a long time to introduce a system for class actions at a European level. The Commission has already carried out six or seven different studies. What do we find now in this work programme? Another study has been commissioned. We cannot go on like this. We want the Commission to finally come up with some proposals and decisions in this area. Evelyne Gebhardt,  
on behalf of the S&amp;D Group.

Madam President, thank you Commissioner Barnier for the work you have done. It was no easy task that you had and you have included something of what Professor Monti set out in his report and what Mr Grech drew up for the European Parliament. We can also see something of that in there, as well as the attempt to take the holistic approach, which has not succeeded in quite the way we imagined it would, but is nevertheless on the right track. It is also very important that you make it absolutely clear that you are attempting to make the social rights of citizens, which should, of course, be at the heart of the European Union’s legislation, a reality. However, on behalf of my group, I have to say that we feel some things in this text are too vague, too simple or too insignificant, or are missing altogether, because one of the crucial demands that we had, and which you also agreed to, was for a social clause to be included in all important areas of European policy. We cannot find this social clause. A commitment to carrying out social impact assessments could satisfy us. However, a social clause is significantly more than what we find here in this text. We will endeavour to help you so that we make progress in the right direction, because this is very important to us. There is another point that I find quite problematic and that was also very important to our group. We are calling for collective redress. We want collective redress for citizens so that they are also genuinely able to assert their consumer protection rights. On behalf of the European Commission, you announced that more studies are to be carried out. Studies have been carried out in this area for three years. I think it is time for us to get on with it and for us to actually receive a legislative proposal from you, not merely another proposal for a study to be carried out, so that we can see how we can move forward from here. As you see, there are some things that we are satisfied with, but other things that we are not so happy about and we will work hard with you, the Council and our fellow Members from the other groups to ensure that we ultimately have a genuinely good text.

 The fight against terrorism requires international cooperation governed by agreements. However, these must not erode the fundamental rights of citizens laid down in the European Charter of Fundamental Rights. In modern times in particular, these rights also include the protection of data, which is not adequately guaranteed by the SWIFT agreement negotiated with the United States. Combating terrorism must not become an excuse for inadequate data protection. Other serious shortcomings in this agreement include, for example, the inspection of bank data without judicial approval, the long retention period for data, something that is impermissible under German constitutional law, as well as an inadequate opportunity for people to defend themselves in court against the unfair use of data. These are serious infringements of fundamental rights. However, the European Union is not permitted to unduly curtail existing fundamental rights. I therefore still reject this SWIFT agreement.

Mr President, Mr Grech, I would like to congratulate you on the truly excellent report which you have tabled before us here and which provides us with a basis from which to move forward. Thank you also for using a phrase which I myself use all the time, namely that the economy is there for the people and not the other way around. That is precisely what the policy of the European Union should be based on. In your report, you also quite rightly point out that an adequate assessment of the social, consumer-related, environmental and economic impacts of the internal market, and the decisions we make in the internal market, are of particular importance. That is precisely what has been missing so far or what has not been made sufficiently visible to our citizens. It is a very important approach to point out the actual humanist and holistic elements of our policy, even when it comes to the internal market. In your report, you also state one thing which is particularly important for us Social Democrats, and that is that social policy should be considered as a core of internal market policy and that protecting services of a general economic interest is of particular importance. In addition, you call for the development of a strategy for improved communication of the social advantages of the internal market. If we consider just these few points, we realise that we could achieve a great deal if only the European Commission gave us its backing. I also very much hope that the Commission will genuinely take the opportunity presented by the Grech report to put the progress of EU citizens centre stage. I make that plea very strongly and, as we know, Mr Barnier has already agreed to do so. If we approach the internal market from that angle, the policy of the European Union will meet with greater acceptance and we will be able to look towards a better future. Evelyne Gebhardt,

 Madam President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, as I follow this debate, I note that there is actually a great deal of uncertainty in relation to how the law is to be applied in these areas. Mr Andor, you just said that there is no European regulation laying down EUR 33 000 as a fixed limit. Dutch legislators, however, have laid down this limit of their own free will, probably because they were afraid that otherwise, the Commission would, at some point, require clear criteria to be put in place. This uncertainty leads to a great many difficulties in the Member States in relation to taking decisions themselves, specifically in terms of shaping those decisions so that they truly match up to what we need for these people and, in particular, for social housing, as these are people who do not have enough money to be able to move about freely. It is therefore very important for us to create a legal framework and legal certainty that also properly clarifies what is possible. Services of general economic interest, of course, really do need to be protected. They are provided at the local level in the Member States and they are universal and we need to ensure that they really are offered to everyone. We therefore have to consider – and I know this is being considered in the Committee on Employment and Social Affairs – demanding from the Commission a legal framework to protect services of general economic interest, especially in the social field, and I think that such a framework, were it to be provided, would be a good thing. Evelyne Gebhardt  (S&amp;D

 Mr President, Commissioner, Mr Manders, thank you very much for the good work that you have put into this regulation. I would also like to give particular thanks to my shadow rapporteur, since although this is indeed a technical report – as has been mentioned a number of times – it has many wide-ranging consequences for our citizens. After all, what we are concerned with here is allowing novel fibres to be placed on the market in the European Union. That is something we want to make possible. The European Commission is right in that. Not just anyhow, however; the fibres must be tested if citizens are genuinely to enjoy the consumer protection that we are always talking about. It is important, for example, to test whether the fibres are allergenic. They must also be clearly labelled, so that our citizens – who are always being described as responsible citizens – can also act accordingly. In this context, I must contradict the Members who have said that we should leave out country-of-origin marking. It is very important and absolutely right. Many citizens want to know where the fibres and textiles come from. What is their background? Their background includes the way in which they were manufactured. It is deplorable, but in many states, child labour or even slave labour are still used. There are citizens who want to know this information so that they can make a responsible choice when buying products. It may not be the job of this regulation, but it is the job of us Members to remind the Council of this and exert pressure to ensure that the text on origin marking that has been on the table since 2005 is at last put to good use. It is an opportunity to turn up this pressure and we should really seize it to achieve a good regulation about which our citizens say: yes, we can certainly live with that – that is the sort of thing we expect of our representatives in Parliament. Evelyne Gebhardt  (S&amp;D

 Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, my group would actually have liked to support Mrs Rühle’s report, because it contains a great many very positive elements. Unfortunately, there are three points that we consider lacking or that we are unable to accept as they stand in the report. Firstly, Mrs Rühle was unable to accept that we genuinely have need of a legal framework for services in the general economic interest, and secondly, she also failed to state clearly that it is a matter of greater legal certainty in the area of social services in particular. This is a shortcoming of the report that we naturally find very regrettable. One point that we are absolutely unable to accept is the rejection of service concessions. We cannot simply say that it is something we do not want. The Court of Justice has already ruled on all this. It is highly unpolitical. It is very important that we say quite clearly what we want if we know that the European Commission is preparing a legal text. It is important that we call upon the European Commission actually to go along with the very positive position taken by the Court of Justice on this matter, thereby also ensuring legal certainty. That is our demand and consequently, we have submitted an alternative resolution. We ask our fellow Members to support this alternative resolution. Evelyne Gebhardt,

 Mr President, Commissioner Barnier, Commissioner Dalli, ladies and gentlemen, today we are talking about the internal market, consumer protection and the mobility of people within the European Union. These are the key issues when we are discussing these three instruments and they are what I want to address in particular. Bringing these three topics together provides a very great advantage for us today, because the economy and the rights of consumers and workers are not intrinsically opposed to one another; they need to be brought together. This is something that we need to make progress on for the future. That is why it is good that we are having this joint debate today. In order to make this a reality, we need, above all, to bring three political principles to the fore. Firstly – and Commissioner Barnier put this very well earlier – protectionism, which is still very much in evidence in the national governments of the Member States, needs to be overcome. That is something we need to do in any case and it is on the agenda. The second political principle is that we must guarantee a high level of protection of the rights of both consumers and workers. In other words, the internal market does not mean the abolition of rights and it does not mean deregulation. It means ensuring that we preserve our very high level of common rights in these areas. For this reason, there is one paragraph in Mrs von Thun Und Hohenstein’s report that we do not agree with. This concerns the so-called Internal Market Scoreboard or internal market test. This is the wrong approach. It gives the impression that the only important thing is how the market is functioning. That is not the case. We need to ask what impact the European Union legislation will have on the rights of workers and on the rights of consumers. We therefore reject this concept, because it is the wrong one. Thirdly, we need good enforcement of these rights at European level. For this, we need a system of collective redress so that consumers do not stand alone in this internal market, but are also able to really assert their rights. Evelyne Gebhardt,  
on behalf of the S&amp;D Group.

 Mr President, Commissioner, thank you very much for the information you have given us but, to be honest, I am not entirely satisfied. The previous Commission set itself the quite clear objective of liberalising the gambling market. The European Parliament has made it clear, time and again, that this cannot be the right approach, because it was the European Parliament, rather than Member States, that, for example, removed gambling from the scope of the Services Directive. We took the view that it is not just any other service, that we must ensure that we introduce safeguards which will protect our citizens from organised crime and that we require clear rules to that end. Nonetheless, the European Commission continues to bring Member States before the European Court of Justice, and it is time that the Commission ceased this practice as it keeps losing cases at the Court. You simply have to face this fact. I would, therefore, welcome it, Mr Barnier, if you put what you have just said, that is, that a different approach is needed in this area, into practice because we cannot proceed with things remaining as they are now. In response to your point, Mr Harbour, I would argue that the rulings of the European Court of Justice have been very consistent and not at all contradictory. In its judgments, the Court has stated, time and again, that Member States have the right to introduce clear rules, so that we can truly verify whether or not citizens are protected against crime, and that Member States are not under any obligation to open this market up. Nor are they under any obligation to allow market operators from other Member States to operate on their territory, as long as they make sure that their controls are strong and effective. That is what we want to see from the European Commission, that it has finally grasped this and acted accordingly. However, this also means that we have to pay particular attention to online gambling, because the Internet does not recognise any barriers or borders and, of course, because our citizens have access to gambling sites. We need to think about how we can shape controls and rules in this area, so that our citizens are protected. Evelyne Gebhardt  (S&amp;D

 Mr President, Mr Barroso, we were very happy to have got the Treaty of Lisbon in place on 1 December and, along with that, a stronger social policy and a strengthening of the position of consumers in the area of internal policy within the European Union. However, we now find that you – contrary to what is contained in the Treaty of Lisbon, namely a horizontal commitment to protect consumers – have done exactly the opposite with the division of the portfolios in your European Commission, because now there is not just one commissioner responsible for consumer protection, but several. I would like to ask you how you actually intend to handle this. How do you intend to establish coherence in this policy area, an area that is extremely important to consumers, to European citizens? The responsibilities have been divided up. Which commissioner will provide this coherence? Please do not tell us that it is the College that will decide. We need clear areas of responsibility. Please do not say to us, either, that ultimately you will decide in the event of a dispute between the different commissioners. You are not almighty and you belong to a College. I have serious difficulties with this, Mr Barroso. You need to explain to me how you can truly get to grips with this fragmentation of policy in the area of consumer protection, but also in other areas like foreign policy, so that we have a policy that, after five years, will allow us to say ‘yes, it was worth having a Commission like this’. I do not yet know how I will vote later. That will depend very much on your answers to our questions. Evelyne Gebhardt,  
on behalf of the S&amp;D Group.

 Mr President, I would first like to say that it is totally outrageous that there are no members of the Commission here, because this is a question directed at the European Commission. This shows contempt for Parliament. It is simply outrageous and we find it totally unacceptable. (Heckling)
 Yes? Yes, he did not get up. Well, I am sorry. I cannot accept that. Moving on to the matter in hand, ladies and gentlemen, this is all about the citizenship of the Union, about the people who have the right to move freely throughout the European Union and to practise their professions where they live and where they choose to work. We have put this legislation in place so that this will become easier and so that the process of recognising professional qualifications can genuinely be brought up to date. I find it simply appalling that the Member States in many cases have not taken the necessary steps to implement this legislation and to ensure that citizens really have this freedom of movement. There is still a great deal to be done by the European Commission in this respect. I would like to draw attention to one point which is very important to me and which we have repeatedly brought up in Parliament. We must ensure that the European professional card, which we have proposed, is introduced. This will put into citizens’ hands something that will allow them to move throughout Europe. There are organisations which are attempting to do this. However, I feel it is important to ask the European Commission whether this is an area in which it could become involved in order to speed this process up. Evelyne Gebhardt,  
on behalf of the S&amp;D Group.

 Mr President, I am grateful that we are able to debate this topic today, as it is such an important one. I would like to make one thing absolutely clear: as Parliament, we have not merely played a part, but we have ensured that, in this Services Directive, a very positive, constructive compromise was found. This compromise is based, in particular, on guaranteeing labour and social rights and on the particular regard for and removal of the services of general economic interest. That was the reason why a Services Directive was possible in the first place. However, there are a few things than I am not sure about in this regard, and the questions that we raised have not been answered. It would, for example, be very disappointing if what I have heard from various sources turned out to be true, namely, that some Member States are using the transposition of the Services Directive to destroy the balance that we, as legislators, have found by not fully respecting the rights of workers as we envisaged in the Services Directive. This relates not only to the working conditions, which are being called into question, but in many Member States, the definitions are also being re-written or made more restrictive. There are also Member States which, with feeble justifications, are not removing the social services from amongst the services to which this transposition relates. In this respect, the European Commission’s Handbook was not very helpful, because the guidelines that it gave were partly wrong and it provided an interpretation that was, in our opinion, incorrect. The examples that I have given show how important it is for us also to create a legal framework for services of general economic interest, so that social rights, such as labour rights, can also be fully and completely respected once again. Anything else would not be sufficient. I would also like to ask the Member States to what extent they have involved the stakeholders and, in particular, the trade unions and the social services, in the transposition. This is a question that we raised, but to which I have not heard an answer, and I would very much like a good answer to this question. Evelyne Gebhardt (S&amp;D).

 Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, one thing needs to be stated very clearly: there is a unified system in China and we do not want to allow this system to break up. We respect the Chinese system. However, that does not mean ... (Interruption by Mr Posselt)
 We respect China’s unified system. However, that does not mean that the diversity of peoples in China must not also be respected. That is what we Social Democrats are calling for. We want citizens’ rights, human rights and people’s freedom to be respected in China. We want freedom of expression to be respected. We want journalists to be able to move around freely so that the situation as it really is can indeed be reported. That is what we want and there is one thing that we would say very clearly to our colleagues in China: what for us is a basic principle we would also expect to be a basic principle for you in China, namely that human rights are universal. What the politicians always say to us – let us first solve the social problems and then we can talk about human rights – is the wrong way to go about things. It must be the other way round. Human rights come first and then social rights, which are quite simply part and parcel of human rights and cannot be separated from them. I was therefore very disappointed by what you said, Mr Bildt. You seemed to be saying: let us work together on an economic level, that is our main concern and all of the other things are of no particular interest to us. That is not the approach that we need. We need to take the approach presented to us by the European Commission, namely to say that we first want a common basis for our work on which we can then build our cooperation, because we do want cooperation, that much is clear, but not on any basis, only on a correct basis that respects human dignity.

Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, the need for European solutions and European emergency plans is nowhere more obvious than in the case of European rivers, since they connect European countries. A bad example of this is the catastrophe two years ago when contaminated sludge from a Hungarian aluminium factory flowed into the Danube. It became obvious in that case how important cooperation is. Furthermore, seamless transport connections are especially important. As co-rapporteur of the report on the development of the trans-European transport network, I consider inland navigation as an important means of transport, because it is environmentally friendly and still has potential for growth. At the same time, we must also comply with emissions targets. We cannot expand at any cost. This means that we must place ecological considerations and environmental protection in the foreground and at the heart of this process.  We have heard today that one of the last free-flowing sections of the Danube between Straubing and Vilshofen is this kind of bad example. In my view, the environment must take precedence here. In the meantime, the CSU environment minister in the government of the state of Bavaria has recognised this. Now he has to convince his Bavarian Prime Minister and the Federal Transport Minister that any investment in further studies is unnecessary and that any investment – I refer here to the EUR 16.5 million which the Commission has also invested in this study – is, unfortunately, money spent in vain. It would be better spent – as Mr Theurer has mentioned – in the Danube Youth Foundation. This is the direction we need to take in future.

Mr President, Ms Lochbihler, thank you for your question. There is actually a certain contradiction in the Danube region strategy: on the one hand is the objective of environmental protection and on the other hand is the objective of supporting those who want to destroy the Danube. I will say quite clearly: it must not be a question of mobility at any price. The ships that travel on rivers must adapt to the rivers, not vice versa. If we give both these objectives equal importance, I can see how we can achieve both goals. Ecological considerations are at least as important as economic components. Ismail Ertug  (S&amp;D

Mr President, Mr President-in-Office of the Council, I would like to congratulate you on taking over the presidency and wish you every success in the job you have to do in these difficult times. You will need to be fully committed, Mr Christofias, when it comes to stimulating growth and creating jobs in the European Union. We are very interested in the specific solutions that you propose for combating youth unemployment You will have the support of Parliament if you take on this problem. The negotiations on the multiannual financial framework naturally have a high priority. You have rightly recognised, and I congratulate you on this, that the financing of the Trans-European Networks will bring significant added value to Europe. I would like to call on you to make a strong commitment to push through in the Council the approach to financing called for by the Commission. Your country will benefit from this, Mr Christofias. For example, the port of Limassol is part of the core transport network, as is Larnaka airport and the road project linking Limassol and Nicosia, which could receive European funding. When we talk about Cyprus, we are, of course, also referring to an unresolved problem which has already been mentioned several times today. Mr Christofias, what sort of scenario should the European Union expect if there is no solution for Cyprus, which after 38 years of unsuccessful negotiations seems more likely than ever?

 Mr President, rapporteur, ladies and gentlemen, I think it is clear that the European Union’s aim is to ensure a better common railways policy. This legislation helps bring that about. In this respect, it will help, for instance, by opening up basic services for the market, which is a beneficial thing to do. I would also like to offer the rapporteur specific thanks for also having stuck to the multiannual financial plans between infrastructure operators and the Member States, as doing so facilitates long-term planning in respect of funding, which provides a certain degree of planning certainty and, above all, it will have a positive impact on the development of the European railway market. We have heard a number of times today already that the most important element in this legislation will be organising the national regulatory bodies as they actually should be organised, which is to say, with more powers and such that they are not as weak as they are in many Member States of the Union. The situation today is that we have regulatory authorities that are unable to make it possible for other competitors to enter the market, and this means that market access is made more difficult. Under this legislation, such unfair practice will, first of all, be monitored and then it will also be eliminated and made possible for punishment to be imposed. My final point concerns what I would definitely consider a step in the right direction, by which, of course, I mean transparency in the financial flows. In this respect, it needs to be very clearly emphasised that this obviously must not pave the way for the pre-emption of the separation of networks and operators, as that would be too serious an intrusion into national subsidiarity rights. We should therefore leave it at that. I would like to offer my sincere thanks to the rapporteur once again, and especially also to the shadow rapporteurs, for the fact that we have produced such sound legislation. Ismail Ertug  (S&amp;D
). 
 – (DE)
 Mr President, first of all, let me add my voice to those thanking the rapporteur for her outstanding work, as well as the shadow rapporteurs, of course. This was a tough job, we are well aware of that. It has always been Parliament’s aim to ensure increased road safety. With various laws, this venerable House has helped to also bring that about. I would remind everyone at this juncture, just by way of example, about the issues of overtiredness behind the wheel and the fight against the exploitation of workers. Irrespective of this, it is, of course, important to constantly adapt to technical changes, technical developments. On that basis, we must continue to prevent manipulation of the devices in future, too, clearly while adhering to strict data protection provisions. Another point that is very important to me and which is achieved by means of this document is the harmonisation of the specific measures for the training of control officers and, very interestingly and importantly, the approximation of penalties. When it comes to the derogation, I would insist that this 150 kilometre stipulation for handicraft businesses be maintained, as this is important for the business of these companies.

The Tymoshenko case and political developments in Ukraine in general indicate that democracy and the rule of law still remain values that cannot be taken for granted in today’s Europe and for which we must actively campaign. The thirst for reform seemed enormous in Ukraine in the period following the Orange Revolution and the country quickly became a perfect example of the success of European neighbourhood policy. In this context I find it extremely regrettable that political life in Ukraine is once again characterised by political trials, political meddling in the administration of justice and state interference. The response of the European Commission and a number of Member States to the latest events is decisive but by no means excessive. The absence of the most senior Members of the Commission from the European Championship in Ukraine sets down a clear marker, but should not divert attention from the problems in the country and the possible solutions. For this reason I welcome your intention, Mr Füle, to continue with the association process with Ukraine if there are positive developments and, above all, if free and fair elections are held this autumn. In order to be able to provide positive support for developments in Ukraine in future, European neighbourhood policy must also incorporate the wishes and expectations of the people of Ukraine. Before we intensify our partnership, however, Yulia Tymoshenko must be given fair treatment. Naturally this must take her health into consideration and must be free from all state interference.

 The resolution before us sends out a clear signal and supports the conviction that the social democrats have had for a long time that the crisis can only be overcome if the financial sector is put in its place. To avoid the excesses of the banks in 2008 from being repeated in the future, we need to rigorously pursue two goals. Firstly, ladies and gentlemen, it must not be possible for banks to operate in such a short-sighted and reckless manner in the future. Secondly, we must invest more in the real economy in order to stem the power of the financial sector in today’s economy. Both of these things can be achieved by the planned tax. Even the extremely low tax rates of 0.01% and 0.1% would provide the Member States with additional resources of up to EUR 100 billion. That EUR 100 billion could relieve the burden on severely stretched budgets and be used to invest in lasting growth. I am confident that you will all use your votes to give this proposal the necessary emphasis, and I call on all the Member States not to block the Commission’s proposal in the Council. However, should such a common EU-wide solution fail due to a handful of naysayers, then the remaining Member States must set a good example by pushing ahead via the process of enhanced cooperation.

 Mr President, Mr Kallas, as competition increases in the years to come, we can expect the volume of traffic to increase even further. If we look at the figures again, it becomes clear that more than a quarter of our current CO2
 emissions are produced by transport. This means that we must reduce our CO2
 emissions and increase the efficiency of our transport systems. In my opinion, you have taken the right approach in your document. Your proposal for new guidelines is primarily about giving priority to environmentally friendly means of transport. However, now we come to the ‘but’, Mr Kallas. This makes it all the more incomprehensible to me that you have seriously considered permitting cross-border transport on Europe’s roads using so-called monster trucks or gigaliners. I would be grateful if you could explain to us why you are considering this, without waiting for the analyses on road safety and the environment, and how you plan to proceed in future. You know that this is a very sensitive subject and that we are opposed to these trucks. Ismail Ertug  (S&amp;D

 All of us have painful memories of the images of the burning Deepwater Horizon oil platform in the spring of 2010. Outdated technology and the conscious acceptance of safety risks led to the two-month long outflow of incredible quantities of crude oil. As we all know, the consequences for people and the environment were disastrous. The fact that there is a danger of the same thing happening at the 450 drilling rigs in the North Sea, for example, was demonstrated in August of this year by the oil leak in the Gannet Alpha pipelines off the Scottish coast. I therefore welcome the proposal put before us to extend the areas of competence of the European Maritime Safety Agency in this regard, so that in future, safety inspections can also be carried out on oil drilling rigs. EMSA has already proven its ability to act in connection with past tanker disasters. On the basis of this experience, I believe that the proposed extension of the areas of competence is preferable to the creation of a new agency. In addition, this kind of European solution to maritime safety problems is preferable to having national supervisory authorities. The faster lines of communication and the cross-border consequences of incidents such as oil disasters can only be tackled at European level. Finally, I would like to thank Mr Fleckenstein for his excellent work as rapporteur and I call on all my fellow Members to support this important dossier. Ismail Ertug  (S&amp;D

 Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, the White Paper on transport was proposed by the Commission in order to set European transport policy goals for the next 20 or 40 years. I know that 40 years is perhaps a very extensive period. However, we must nevertheless bear in mind that transport projects require lengthy planning phases. I therefore support the long-term approach taken by the Commission. Let us take a look at the ambitious goals of the Commission, which I support: increased safety through the use of intelligent transport technologies, improved traffic routing using multimodal solutions, the internalisation of external costs and, above all, transport must become even more environmentally friendly. There are some good approaches and, in this regard, I would refer to the legislative proposals for environmentally friendly urban transport up to 2015. While we are on the subject of environmental protection, I would once again like to point out that it is extremely important to reduce greenhouse gas emissions still further. As regards the development of inland waterways, I would also like to take this opportunity to mention once again the planned development of the Danube. In this regard, we must ensure that this does not ultimately damage the natural environment. I would like to quote Mr Cramer here, who quite rightly always says that ships must be adapted to the river and not the other way around. I am pleased to see that good amendments were tabled in this regard. I would like to thank the rapporteur once again for being so ready to compromise. Finally, I would like to mention one more thing: I would have liked us to have implemented the 300 km approach in connection with the shifting of goods transport from the roads onto the railways. However, I would essentially like to say thank you very much and I hope this will be successful. Ismail Ertug  (S&amp;D

Madam President, Mr Koumoutsakos, ladies and gentlemen, the report on the Commission’s proposal for a programme to support the further development of an integrated maritime policy is one way to achieve the objectives of the Treaty of Lisbon and to increase coherence between the various policy areas. It is a welcome development that solutions have been sought on a cross-departmental basis in maritime policy and that an attempt has also been made to create synergies. Maritime policy goes beyond marine transport and fishing. Industry, research and alternative power generation, as well as environmental protection, are areas that are inseparably associated with the classic aspects of maritime policy. For this reason, there is a need for improved coordination between policy areas and between Member States with access to the sea. The report has improved on the Commission’s proposal on several counts. In this context, I expressly welcome the fact that more attention has been paid to environmental protection, the protection of species and the sustainable use of maritime resources, an aspect which, I must say, could have been given even more prominence in the Commission’s proposal. Mr Koumoutsakos, I hope that you receive a broad negotiating mandate for your report and would also like to thank Mr Milana for his work and wish you all the best for the future.

 Madam President, Ms Serracchiani, ladies and gentlemen, this proposal takes us one step closer to a simpler, more effective joint rail policy. The significantly strengthened regulatory body and financial plans spanning several years will help make rail travel more competitive and reliable. I am also particularly pleased that the rapporteur has succeeded in including social aspects in the focus of the report. After all, an integrated rail market must offer employees the same high-standard working conditions throughout the European Union. In this context, it is correct that the right to strike should remain inviolable. Opinion has been divided for some time in relation to the separation of the rail network and the operating companies and I would like expressly to thank the rapporteur for her tenacity and willingness to negotiate, because this has helped us find a well-balanced compromise. We now await the legislative proposal from the European Commission. Finally, I would ask and encourage you all to give our rapporteur broad support with a mandate that will enable her to enter into discussions and negotiations with the Council. A solid path has been laid. With this in mind, I would like to thank the rapporteur and wish her well. Ismail Ertug  (S&amp;D

 The road safety measures called for in the report are practical and ambitious. That is the only way that we can reduce the number of accidents on Europe’s roads in future. With the call for a stringent alcohol ban for newly qualified drivers and professional drivers and the call for a ‘vision zero’, Parliament can send out a clear message that road safety has top political priority and road deaths are simply not morally acceptable. If the Commission and the Council get behind the measures that we have proposed, we can at last actually begin to work towards such ambitious objectives. Ismail Ertug  (S&amp;D

 Poland joined the EU seven years and two months ago and we are pleased to see it take over the Presidency of the Council of the European Union. Poland is putting its hand to the tiller at a time when Europe is facing great challenges in terms of its finances, energy policy and internal politics. We therefore doubly welcome the fact that Poland also intends pursuing ambitious goals in transport policy. We Social Democrats welcome the fact that you intend to promote the improvement of social conditions for workers in the transport sector. By taking up the expansion of the Trans-European Transport Networks, you are not only planning to keep in view economic and territorial cohesion, but also the social cohesion of the various regions of the EU. As an advocate of sustainable transport policy, I am particularly pleased that your priorities are in line with those of the White Paper on Transport and that you are anxious to work with Parliament to find a speedy solution for the new version of the first railway package.

 For me, one particularly important issue with regard to security scanners is that the machines which are available must meet the necessary technical requirements, so that they do not slow down the operational processes and, therefore, lead to undesirable results. The main problems in my view are a reduction in passenger comfort and the introduction of complex processes which ultimately do not bring any increase in security. Unfortunately, past experience indicates that difficulties of this kind may occur. It is important to make the deadline for introducing the new systems dependent on the technology being fully functioning rather than on a specified date. In addition, it must be possible to combine the new machines with systems for detecting liquids. I would also like to highlight the fact that issues of space and structural engineering need to be taken into consideration in the case of the control unit (in other words, the security scanner and the X-ray device). Major structural alterations will be needed at many airports to support the weight of the machine and to make the necessary space available. The throughput rate for passengers must be equivalent to the existing figures at the passenger checkpoints. Otherwise there will be significant operational and quality problems. It is essential that the airports are able to put realistic plans in place. We must not forget that the necessary facilities must be made available, including space for the machines, structural engineering work and training measures, and that comprehensive plans are needed which cover the time and funding needed for the alterations to the buildings.

− (DE) My aim is still to achieve a uniform ban on genetically modified organisms (GMOs) in all Member States. We cannot tell what impact GMOs will have on our health, because the technology is still too new. The fundamental problem is that it has spread so rapidly. Having once introduced the technology, it is now impossible to get rid of it. Therefore, I welcome the fact that we are adopting a report today which makes a ban on GMOs possible and which strengthens consumers’ rights. Once again we are reinforcing consumers’ rights more effectively than the Member States have done. The European Parliament was responsible for introducing the mandatory labelling of GMOs last year, not the Council of Ministers. This report makes it possible for Member States to impose a ban on GMOs, because of the fear of pesticide resistance, for example. The fact that the World Trade Organisation (WTO) does not feel that concerns about the health of the population are sufficient grounds for a ban causes me to have very serious doubts about the WTO.

Madam President, as you said, Mr Kallas, the gigaliners or monster trucks or whatever you want to call them are a controversial subject. You mentioned efficiency gains in terms of fuel consumption. I would like to know what exactly these efficiency gains are. I know that those in favour of these trucks say that you can make one truck out of two. This would ultimately result in warehousing as we know it today becoming less expensive and it would be cheaper to drive goods around on the streets than to store them in warehouses, with the result that making one truck out of two would actually have exactly the opposite effect. I would like to ask you to consider this, because it would mean that we would have more trucks on the roads than we did before. You have announced various studies on the subject of the monster trucks. What is happening with them? What results have you so far received? What are the next steps to be taken? I would be interested in knowing more, because Germany does not have a uniform approach to these trucks and most people are opposed to them. Ismail Ertug  (S&amp;D

Mr President, Commissioner, President-in-Office of the Council, ladies and gentlemen, over 31 000 people a year are still dying on European roads. That being so, I find it negligent, to say the least, that the Member States’ transport ministers have blocked such an important instrument in the Council for over two years. As representatives of the people, you should be keen, for the safety of your citizens, to ensure that drivers from non-Member States cannot disregard traffic rules with impunity. The fact that we shall be voting on this proposal tomorrow is due, above all, to our rapporteur’s persistence. Like her, I too am disappointed that the Council has changed the legal basis for this directive, thereby provoking an opt-out by three Member States. This will create a law for EU-wide prosecution of traffic offences that will not be applied throughout the EU and I consider this less than perfect, to put it mildly. This disappointment notwithstanding, it is another important step towards closer cooperation in the road traffic sector and I should like to ask you all to vote in favour of this compromise tomorrow. I should like to point out once again that the rapporteur campaigned extremely hard for a strong review clause and to thank her for that; I hope that, when the review comes around within the next five years, the transport ministers will be not only older, but also wiser.

 We in the Group of the Progressive Alliance of Socialists and Democrats in the European Parliament have worked hard to ensure that the new EU agricultural policy is oriented towards ecological standards. In our view, farmers must be rewarded for providing services to society. That is exactly what they do, and nothing could be rewarded less in the prices currently being achieved at market. Retaining the two-pillar model guarantees that farmers will continue to receive a fixed amount in the future that they can rely on. These payments are important for long-term planning. By linking the direct payment to an economic variable we can achieve the transition from a Europe of 15 Member States to a Europe of 27 without offending anyone too much. The report is a good compromise; it is a European compromise. The question now is what the Commission, and particularly President Barroso, will make of it. Cutting the funding for environmental protection in particular suggests narrow-mindedness, and I hope Commissioner Cioloş will be able to talk him out of it. Ismail Ertug,  
on behalf of the S&amp;D Group.

 Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, following a negotiations marathon, Mr El Khadraoui and the representatives of the Council and the Commission managed to tie up an improved package of measures for road charging for heavy goods vehicles in Europe. I am very grateful to those involved and, in particular, to our rapporteur, for what they have achieved. Through the recognition of the principle of internalising external costs, the partial earmarking of funding for the transport infrastructure and the incentives provided for fleet renewal, we have succeeded in realising important objectives from the Transport White Paper. I also believe that we must not overlook the obligations for transparency, which ultimately must also apply to the Council. I find it highly regrettable that several Member States attempted, even after the conclusion of the trialogue negotiations, to throw a spanner in the works – they really did try – in connection with the correlation tables in order to block this directive. Nonetheless, I would like to conclude by calling on all my fellow Members to accept the compromise achieved and not to jeopardise the results of these long and laboured negotiations, as all that would achieve would be to help the wrong people. You have my thanks for backing this compromise. Ismail Ertug  (S&amp;D
),

 We are absorbing antibiotics in our food, which is resulting in increased resistance. This is one area of medical progress which is gradually being ruined and we have known about this for a long time. Mr De Castro referred to the measures that have already been taken. I support the proposals made in the resolution. There are two aspects of this which I would like to focus on. Regulations alone are not enough. In the dioxin scandal, we have seen how easily they can be undermined, if individual ‘black sheep’ behave in a very negligent way. Of course, we must have regulations and we need to introduce monitoring systems, but that is not the entire solution. In the medium and long term, the solution is to make the use of antibiotics largely superfluous. We can achieve this firstly by investing in research and networking expert knowledge, secondly, by passing this knowledge on to farmers and vets and thirdly, by providing information to consumers. We must make clever use of market forces, because it is consumers who decide in the long term how their food is produced. Ismail Ertug  (S&amp;D

 Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, the volcanic ash of last year showed us in an impressive way where our weaknesses lie. The question therefore arises as to how we should deal with such situations in the future. It is, of course, first and foremost a question of the safety of those people who board an aeroplane. Of course, we must also keep in mind how we intend to deal with the financial losses. My question to the Commission is therefore – Mr Hahn, perhaps you could also pass this on to Mr Kallas – what, in specific terms, are we planning? I would argue that it is particularly important for us to take over the coordination when it comes to test flights and limit values. That is very important in order for us to know which aeroplanes can take off and when. I have another comment, Commissioner: it is extremely important – and this has already been referred to many times – to establish the Single European Sky. What does the Commission intend to do in terms of exerting pressure on the Member States to actually fulfil their obligation in this regard? After all, they have put their signatures to it. Another important point, which has already been made several times today, is what happens now with regard to passengers’ rights in air transport. We have Regulation (EC) No 2061 from 2004. What does the Commission intend to do in this regard? We are aware of the problem of the financial losses suffered by the various airlines. I would also like to point out once again that we need alternatives to air transport, and by that I mean the rail system. I am also one of those who believe that we must link the large cities – Europe’s capital cities – together. In this case, too, the answer is that we need more involvement from Europe, not less. I would be pleased if the Commission would give its attention to these issues. Ismail Ertug  (S&amp;D

Madam President, Mr President-in-Office of the Council, Mr Füle, I would like to wish you every success with your work in future. It is hard to ignore the ambivalence of the Cyprus issue. We in the European Union must not dismiss apparently unpleasant issues or try to pretend that they do not exist. We have not kept our promise. That is a fact and we must resolve these double standards. We know that the Ankara Protocol must definitely be implemented with regard to the Cyprus question. However, it is also clear, as stated by the Council in 2004, that the isolation of Northern Cyprus must come to an end. I am pleased that Southern Cyprus is providing the north with the necessary support, but this was not the intention of the European Union. Its intention was that everyone, the entire EU, should bring an end to the isolation. In order to overcome the final obstacle in this area, we must take a step forwards and put a stop to this isolation. Ismail Ertug  (S&amp;D

 Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, Turkey is, of course, an emotional topic, that is quite clear. There is one thing that we should, of course, always take into account in this context, and this has been mentioned several times today, namely that, although the prohibition of the party is totally unacceptable, it was not pronounced by the government, but by the judicial system. We need to draw a distinction here in order to be fair and honest. However, that was not what I wanted to say. As Europeans, we must ask ourselves where we actually want to go. If, as a global player, we want to pass on not only economic – and as a Social Democrat I would like to emphasise this – but also political values, not only in Europe but also beyond European borders out into the world, then for this, ultimately, we need Turkey. It will also give us the opportunity to be firm and clear in our dealings with Turkey, which is exactly what is required. Only then will we succeed in setting a democratisation process in motion in order to succeed in our overall purpose. Jens Geier,  
on behalf of the S&amp;D Group.

Madam President, President Caldeira, Commissioner Šemeta, ladies and gentlemen, I would like to begin by thanking the Court of Auditors for presenting this annual report, our most important tool in the discharge procedure for the Commission’s budget. My sincere thanks for this transparent report, which I believe will do much to help us more forward.  This report makes it clear that for the 18th
 time in succession, there can only be a limited statement of assurance for the work of the Commission, and as Mr Pieper has already said, the trend towards an improving error rate year on year has stopped. This House abides by its demand, however: what we want to see is a clear trend towards an improving error rate in the implementation of the EU budget. We are not prepared to accept the present situation. The Court of Auditors’ annual report also sends out a clear message to the Council, however, which is meeting this evening in order to find a compromise for the multiannual financial framework. Poorly functioning management and control systems in the Member States, overdue financial corrections at a high level, unnecessarily complicated rules in the Member States: anyone who wants better spending and does not use this as camouflage for cuts can start here. Anyone who wants better spending must improve the controls in the Member States, not cut the budgets. Anyone who wants better spending must also do their homework in their own country, for in Germany, the Netherlands and the United Kingdom, the control systems, according to the Court of Auditors and the Commission, are only effective to a limited extent. What concerns us about budget management in 2011 is that in some areas of the budget, the figures have got worse, as Mr Pieper has already pointed out. In research policy, for example – an area of the budget that is, in fact, directly administered by the Commission – the error rate has doubled from 1.4 to 3 %. Here, we must demand a plan of action from the Commissioner for Research, setting out how the Commission intends to reduce these error rates. In the common agricultural policy, the error rate generally hovered around the materiality threshold of 2 %. Now, the Court of Auditors estimates the error rate in rural development to be an incredible 7.7 %, meaning that spending on rural development has by far the highest error rate of any area investigated.  We cannot be consoled by the explanation that the programmes in the Member States have now reached full maturity, or by the explanation that the number of development projects is also increasing, so the errors are rising as well. No, what we want to see here is a remedy, and the Directorate-General for Agriculture and Rural Development and Commissioner Cioloş should be resolute in their efforts to move Member States towards better controls, as has already been achieved in regional policy. This is a good example of how tackling the causes can have a positive effect. The figure of 6 % for erroneous payments as a proportion of the total is still too high but the trend is moving in the right direction. The action plan adopted in 2008 has done much to improve the situation by greatly increasing the Commission’s supervision of the national management and control systems. Commissioner Cioloş should therefore start by seeking ideas for his own action plan to reduce the growing error rates in agricultural policy as well. There is room for improvement in regional policy too. We want retrospective projects to be removed from funding at last. We want the Directorate-General for Regional Policy to take the same robust action as the Directorate-General for Employment by suspending and cancelling funding programmes if Member States cannot guarantee proper and lawful control, and we want net corrections: Member States should only be able to transfer funds to other projects if they themselves detect errors in project management. If they are unable to detect the errors themselves, as is so often the case, the funding should revert to the Commission. Jens Geier,  
deputising for the rapporteur.

 Madam President, I am standing in, today, for Ms Ayala Sender, who is in Algeria as part of an electoral observers’ delegation and is thus unable to act as rapporteur for discharge of the other institutions. Let me start with the good news: we intend to move that the majority of the other institutions should be discharged. We had difficulty with the granting of discharge to the Economic and Social Committee because, although various requirements of the European Parliament in relation to questions of travel expenses claims and similar problems that attract a great deal of interest in the media have been met, we are somewhat concerned to find that there have been some differences of opinion within the Committee in relation to certain decisions on appointments – I trust you will understand my wish to choose my words with care here. The rapporteur has expressed her concerns in relation to this issue at Committee level and we shall continue to monitor the situation. However, this will not prevent us from requesting discharge. In the case of the Council, the situation is slightly different. Firstly, I would like to express my satisfaction and pleasure to find that the Danish Council Presidency is doing us the honour of following this debate. This is a first in all my time as a Member of his House. This is an encouraging sign that we are moving away from the phase where the institutions simply ignored one another during debates. I will return to this point at the end of my remarks. Each year, we find ourselves in a situation reminiscent of ‘Groundhog Day’. In other words, we start the business of discharging the Council for its management of the budget, or at least for the portion that involves European Union resources – in other words, the general budget funds. We assess the documents and we ask pertinent questions. The Council never gives any answers, however. Instead, we have received an offer from the Council to negotiate an interinstitutional agreement. This is something to be welcomed from my point of view at least because I have a difficulty when I find the Secretaries-General of the two institutions negotiating with one another, despite the fact that they do not have a political mandate – please do not take this personally Mr Welle – because, in my opinion, they have failed to pay enough attention to the aspirations, wishes and positions of the responsible Committee. Thus, we have a proposal for an interinstitutional agreement on the table and the position of my group in this House is that we should put the opportunities offered by this interinstitutional agreement to the test. Unfortunately we are in the minority here, because most of my fellow Members believe that the documents describe the functions adequately. At this point, I would like to emphasise once again that the Group of the Progressive Alliance of Socialists and Democrats does not wish to reduce the rights and responsibilities of the discharge authority, but that it would like to see how far we can get with the Council if we follow the strategy of negotiating this interinstitutional agreement. The main problem is reciprocity, as the Council insists that it should be allowed to examine Parliament’s auditing process, adopting the same high-handed approach as it takes to answering our questions to the Council. One more thing, Madam President; the bottom line for Parliament is that we cannot accept a situation where civil servants from the Member States control the public representatives who express the will of the citizens of Europe. Everything else is open to negotiation, so perhaps we shall succeed in making a little progress today. Jens Geier  (S&amp;D

Madam President, Ms Andreasen has just asked the European taxpayer to stop paying money to Brussels because, supposedly, no one is interested in spending practices. Exactly the opposite is true. This House is extremely interested in the spending practices of the EU institutions and what happens with the European taxpayers’ money. The problem is that our conclusions are different from those of Ms Andreasen. The Group of the Progressive Alliance of Socialists and Democrats certainly comes to very different conclusions in relation to the situation of the European agencies. Let me give you a brief run-down based on the example of the European Medicines Agency (EMA). Thanks to the work of our rapporteur of last year, Mr Stavrakakis, the EMA now has the strictest ‘Conflict of interest’
 system in Europe. The rapporteur for the European People's Party (Christian Democrats) has come to the conclusion that this is not enough and suggests that the discharge should be deferred, arguing that this system must first prove itself. This is precisely the opposite of the burden of proof outlined by Ms Herczog in her contribution. Ms Macovei, if the effectiveness of this system is to be put to the test, then this is the job of the next rapporteur, Mr Gerbrandy from the Group of the Alliance of Liberals and Democrats for Europe. If we find that the system does not work, then we can fine-tune it. However, to insist that an agency should not be discharged until the system has proven itself is to turn the burden of proof on its head. At this point, I fail to understand your claim that you are not seeking to damage the agency. The damage has already been done. We simply need to take a look at how the media has reported on your report, questioning the independence of stakeholders or experts in the agencies. You have already inflicted the damage that you say you wanted to avoid. We do indeed have a problem. The problem is that we cannot find independent rapporteurs or experts because you will find it difficult to identify university lecturers who have not worked for industry in the past. It is also the function of the agencies to cooperate with the private sector. Perhaps we really do need absolute clarity in declarations, separation of responsibilities and regulations. This cannot be achieved by deferring the discharge, however, Ms Macovei. For this reason, we will not be supporting your report. Jens Geier  (S&amp;D
),

 Mr Bradbourn, I share many of the opinions you have expressed. I have one question for you, however, in light of the judgment of the European Court of Auditors that the United Kingdom is responsible for 10% of the errors in cohesion policy: what is the Conservative Party of Great Britain doing to eliminate this mismanagement by British administrative authorities? Jens Geier,  
rapporteur.
 – (DE)
 Mr President, Mr Ehrenhauser, that fits in very nicely inasmuch as I can answer your question straight away. It is quite clear to me that, at this juncture, it is not a question of refusing discharge. However, if the rapporteur for the discharge in respect of the agencies raises accusations against the agencies, some of which lie outside the responsibility of these institutions, because the staffing of certain bodies, which you rightly described as excessive, is the responsibility of the Member States, then in October, the only option will be to refuse discharge, because this situation will not have changed, because the Member States will not have altered their behaviour with regard to the agencies. Therefore, the political instrument is not the appropriate one. The Group of the Progressive Alliance of Socialists and Democrats in the European Parliament really is now the last not to take the conflicts of interest seriously. The case just mentioned by Commissioner Šemeta is one that once again throws some pertinent light on the situation. However, the problem will not be resolved by postponing discharge. In committee, I have repeatedly argued that, to resolve the issue, we must wait for the report from the European Court of Auditors, which President Caldeira has, thankfully, informed us about, in order to reach conclusions based on a more thorough knowledge of the facts, which we can then also discuss in a serious debate. I am on the point of making accusations about certain situations, such as the issue that you also mentioned concerning the choice of seats of the agencies. In a press statement, I myself have criticised the fact that the UK Government is forcing one agency to establish its offices in Canary Wharf. That is the most expensive property market that the European Union has to offer. This is the same government that is proposing that the EU make savings. It really must start with its own decisions. Thus, with regard to the question of whether the criticism is justified, there is far less disagreement than there perhaps appears to be. The arguments relate to the question of what the political response to this should be. Jens Geier,  
rapporteur.

 Madam President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, are there 111 774 or 125 218 officers serving in Afghanistan’s national police force? This question remains to be answered. That is one of the problems that we encounter when we examine the issue of the use of EU aid in Afghanistan. This question is not inconsequential, as the salaries of the Afghan police officers are paid through the Law and Order Trust Fund for Afghanistan (LOTFA), which was set up by the United Nations Development Programme. LOTFA is the largest recipient of financial aid in Afghanistan. We do not know how many police officers there are because the databases of the Afghan police force are unreliable. Up to now, the European Union has provided funds to Afghanistan via three different channels. There is the use of private contracting partners which fulfil contracts issued by the European Commission. There are non-governmental organisations and there are the multi-donor trust funds, the largest being maintained by the United Nations, and there is another important one that was set up by the World Bank for the development of Afghanistan. These are the channels through which the European Union’s projects in Afghanistan, which must meet a number of criteria, are financed. They are to ensure the visibility of the European Union in Afghanistan. They are to support capacity building in the public administration. They must not be vulnerable to corruption. They must be sustainable. They are to be aligned with the regional priorities, but also with the priorities of the government. If we examine the strengths and weaknesses of the channels through which we transfer funds to Afghanistan, then we see that not all of the criteria can be met via any one channel, but that each of the different channels that the European Union uses to transfer funds to Afghanistan has its own particular strengths, but also its own particular risks. Two of the important objectives, namely, capacity building in the public administration and alignment with the priorities of the government, cannot be met at all via the channels used up to now. In my report, I therefore propose that we use a fourth channel, one that is now used for Afghanistan by many donors in the international community although not as yet by the European Union, and that is the channel of direct budget support to the Afghan state. This direct support to the Afghan budget brings with it a number of problems. One of these became very clear in media reports when it was found that cash – dollars in this case – was immediately being taken out of Afghanistan by the box-load, and I am pleased to be able to say at this point that, if these boxes contained any European funds at all, it would have only been a very small amount. With their direct budget support, the Americans had to learn a very expensive lesson in using this channel. However, they have learnt that lesson. They are proceeding step by step. They are taking it department by department of the Afghan ministries and ensuring that certain criteria are met, namely, that management and control systems are employed, that there are mechanisms for combating corruption in place, and that accountability to the Afghan Parliament is ensured. I believe that if the European Commission were to follow the same path, that is to say, take a step-wise approach, set clear goals for the Afghan Government that are retrievable and possible to monitor, ensure that there is accountability to the Afghan Parliament and – I believe this is very important – a truly independent Afghan court of auditors, then we can also support the use of this channel. After the withdrawal of the military, there will be a greater need for civilian aid. We must therefore ensure that this aid functions in a targeted, effective and sustainable way and that the funds provided by the European Union are protected against corruption and waste. That is in the best interests not only of European taxpayers, but of Afghanistan, too. Jens Geier,

 Mr President, Mr Caldeira, Mr Šemeta, ladies and gentlemen, the overall error rate for spending from the EU budget was 3.7%. This figure is too high. A resolution by this House based on the Liberadzki report calls for this figure to be constantly reduced. I am concerned that the Court of Auditors’ annual report for the financial year 2010 shows that the trend is being reversed. After three years of falling error rates, the figure is now increasing again. Unfortunately, European regional policy is once again responsible, because the error rate in this area rose from 5.5 to 7.7%. Interestingly, information from the European Commission shows that the United Kingdom is in third place behind Spain and Italy in the list of states where the most errors take place. We know that errors are being made because of divided management in the Member States and we know which Member States are responsible. Therefore, we are calling on the Commission to focus on monitoring activities in these countries. The Commission must suspend or interrupt the programmes, but the error rate must come down. If we look at revenue, it is clear that one eighth of the European budget is made up of income from external tariffs. The Member States are also failing to fulfil their obligations in this area. Duties are not being levied efficiently and once again Italy and the United Kingdom, together with the Netherlands, are the main culprits. I would like to thank the European Court of Auditors, you, Mr Caldeira and all your staff for this important document, which we will make detailed use of in the forthcoming discharge procedure.

 Mr President, President-in-Office of the Council, Commissioner Lewandowski, ladies and gentlemen, it is of course also appropriate at this point for we shadow rapporteurs to express our thanks and appreciation to the two rapporteurs from this House. They delved so deeply into the subject that sometimes we could no longer see them. My compliments on this splendid work. In connection with the Financial Regulation, we are also discussing Article 56, which deals with shared management. In the European Union, that is particularly important in regional policy and represents the second largest budget area. It represents the acid test for whether the Member States really are serious about the prudent use of EU funds, about which we have heard so much in the budget debates this morning. We see that, since 1994, there has been a total of more than EUR 7 billion in financial corrections in this area. We also see that, in 2010 alone, there was more than EUR 250 million in repayments to the EU budget – funds that were misspent in the Member States. At this point, I would like once again to recall the fact that EUR 250 million is more than the European Parliament wants to mobilise by means of the Flexibility Instrument. All I can say, Mr Dominik, is that when you next visit in the Council, please convey a message from the Committee on Budgets: we want our money back! What has been proposed in terms of audits and better control procedures in the Financial Regulation within the framework of Article 56 will help in this regard. I will be interested to see how the Council responds to this. Jens Geier,  
on behalf of the S&amp;D Group.

 Madam President, Mr Dominik, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, the question of discharge for the Council has been an institutional bone of contention between Parliament and the Council for years. According to our interpretation, the process is governed by Article 319 of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union, which governs the discharge of the Commission’s budget, and the corresponding article in the Financial Regulation. So far, the Council has not been in agreement with this view. It presently argues that, as it uses operational funding from the Commission’s budget, it is also discharged along with the Commission’s budget. I do not wish to repeat the statements and positions that I and the other members of the Committee on Budgetary Control have heard from the Council in this connection. All I would say is that there have been many of them and, in my view, they have not always been coherent. I think it is an important development that the Council is now ready to negotiate at a political level, rather than at the level of the Secretaries-General – who I do not believe have sufficient political mandate for this – as it informed us by means of a letter following the Committee on Budgetary Control’s decision on the granting of discharge to the Council. I would like to express my sincere thanks to the Presidency of the Council for this new offer. I take the view that we should take up this offer of negotiations with the highest-ranking negotiating delegation we can muster. I also believe that we should not go into the negotiations with predetermined ideas. I therefore recommended to my group that we should abstain at this point.

 Mr Søndergaard, I am happy to give you the answer to this, which is that these are simply rumours. At this point, I could simply fall back on the position of not commenting on rumours. However, I have just presented our group’s position, namely, that we are going to abstain at this juncture in order to enable negotiations to take place with the Council on a level not encumbered with predetermined ideas. We acted in a similar way when it came to your discharge report for the Council. Jens Geier  (S&amp;D

 Mr President, I would like to issue an explanation of vote on behalf of the Group of the Progressive Alliance of Socialists and Democrats in the European Parliament. The question of the granting of discharge for the Council by the European Parliament has been an institutional bone of contention for years. The Council and Parliament have not yet managed to resolve this issue amicably. The European Parliament bases its argument for its right to grant discharge on Article 319 of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union, and the corresponding articles in the Financial Regulation. It goes without saying that the S&amp;D Group shares this position. We insist on Parliament’s right to monitor and evaluate the proper use of taxpayers’ money by the Council. So far, the Council has not been in agreement with this view. At present, the Council argues that it is granted discharge along with the Commission budget. The S&amp;D Group does not share this view. We want to see a clear and balanced procedure that has been negotiated with the Council and that sets out the rights and obligations of the institutions. We are convinced that we should take the negotiated route first. This is because the non-granting of discharge to the Council will have no impact, as the EU Treaty does not provide for any consequences for such an occurrence. However, since the non-granting of discharge remains legally without consequence, the S&amp;D Group decided to abstain. Jens Geier,  
rapporteur for the opinion of the Committee on Regional Development
. – (DE)
 Madam President, I would like to use a minute now as rapporteur for the opinion of the Committee on Regional Development and then speak for two minutes later in the debate on behalf of my group. Madam President, Mr Becsey, Commissioner Šemeta, President Caldeira, ladies and gentlemen, the regional policy budget remains the Achilles heel of the European Union general budget. Five percent of payments from the European Regional Fund still have errors and must therefore be described as irregular payments. Even some of the payments that appear to be correct are actually supporting grotesque projects. May I remind you that an Elton John concert in Naples was subsidised by the European Regional Fund. It was said to be a measure to promote tourism. That might be the case, but in my opinion real regional aid for Naples should take a different form. The reason for this is that all too often the Member States still consider funding from the European Regional Fund to be soft money. This is obvious from the fact that there is a backlog of repayments due from irregular payments, from the fact that very often the Commission has to use the instrument of suspending payments – something that, as budget controllers, we expressly welcome – and from the fact that the punctuality of reporting suffers. The Director General for Regional Policy cannot provide us with any assurance as to the legality and reliability of over half the operational programmes because the reporting by the Member States is inadequate. Ladies and gentlemen, we still have a lot to do here. Jens Geier  (S&amp;D
).

 Mr President, I would like to thank Mr Ulmer for his noticeably factual contribution. It makes a pleasant contrast to many of the things that I have heard said about the agencies this morning. It is extremely depressing that many of the Members from the Eurosceptic parts of this House can never think of anything else but the agencies when it comes to budget cuts. May I remind you that when these agencies were allocated it seemed that the prime ministers and governments of the Member States of the European Union could not get enough of these agencies on their soil. Yet now people are acting as if they are the scourge of the European Union. I am very pleased at the announcement of a study by the European Court of Auditors into the management costs of the agencies. I believe it will provide us with a basis to at last have a more objective debate. I am delighted – as I said previously in my first contribution – that the representatives of the Hungarian Presidency are here with us this morning. That is not something we can take for granted when there is a debate that includes the discharge of the Council. I would therefore like to address you directly, Mr Becsey. I am pleased that the Council is prepared to recognise – as I took from the comments made by Mr Deutsch – that the budget proceedings and the discharge procedure must be dealt with differently. This European Parliament is the people’s representation and it demands accountability for the use of taxpayers’ money. We will therefore not shirk from demanding that the Council be held accountable for the money given to the Council from the Community budget to finance its work. Of course, there is plenty that we could negotiate on, such as what form the discharge procedure should take in the future. However, I should like to ask you whether you seriously expect the European Parliament to negotiate on something that is our right under the treaties. After all, that could only result in this right being restricted. I fail to see why I, as a Member of the European Parliament, would do that. Unfortunately, we do not have many opportunities to discuss things together and I would be delighted if you would take this opportunity to make it clear to us for once who it is in the Council that is actually fighting against the necessary transparency.

 Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, when I listen to the debate on the House of European History, it seems to me that there are only two types of Members in this House: the budget specialists, who attend this debate and who are largely critical of this project, and everybody else, who seem to find the whole thing to be just fine. The worst thing here is that when it comes to the issue of the House of European History there are so many cooks that people have actually lost sight of the point of the whole exercise. Thus, the Daily Telegraph today reported that documents have come into its possession indicating that the cost of this project has risen to the astronomical figure of GBP 137 million. I can only invite the Daily Telegraph to forward these documents to the Committee on Budgets and to let us see from it some of the transparency that the press demands from the Members of this House. I would welcome an opportunity to examine the evidence. Does this project make sense? Naturally it makes sense to foster an awareness of what the European Union and European integration have meant for people’s lives. Should a parliament operate a museum? No, definitely not. That is why the Group of the Progressive Alliance of Socialists and Democrats in the European Parliament have followed two guiding principles on this project. The first is: we demand that the project should have a business plan. The second is: we want clarity on the follow-up costs, that is, how this project is to be funded going forward. We might add a third principle: we should avoid any duplications or overlaps between the Infocentre and the House of European History. Jens Geier,

 Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, Commissioner Šemeta, We know that 80% of the EU budget is administered in a shared management arrangement, which means that money is administered and spent in the Member States, which is exactly where the errors, irregularities and fraud occur. The annual report on the protection of the European Union’s financial interests is a bit like the Member States’ list of sins, which is why I would like to thank Mr Cătălin Sorin and the shadow rapporteurs from the other groups for their hard work. I found the Commission’s report on the protection of the European Union’s financial interests contains one remarkable sentence – on page 11 in the German version. It reads: ‘For the Objective 2 programmes, the very high irregularity rates of the UK and the Netherlands, which mainly benefit from this type of programmes, may have influenced the overall rate.’ The United Kingdom and the Netherlands are two of the countries that have proposed cutting the European budget. From my position I can only call on them to make sure that European taxpayers’ money is spent correctly and to combat the level of irregularities in their countries. I would be very interested to hear whether you have anything else to add in this context, Commissioner. Jens Geier  (S&amp;D

Madam President, Commissioner Lewandowski, ladies and gentlemen, this morning we are debating the need to make savings in view of the debt crisis that we are experiencing in the Member States. Mrs Trüpel and others have quite rightly pointed out that this debt crisis affects us only indirectly, as it is not permitted for debts to be incurred at European level. Yet how can we pursue an austerity policy in the European Union if the volume of European expenditure is only 2% of the total public expenditure of all 27 Member States? I believe that this is not an austerity policy at all. Instead, it is a question of symbols – symbols that are in some way passed to us by the Member States as if money that is transferred to Brussels for the European budget in effect disappears into a deep black hole. This completely ignores the fact that the funds that go into the European budget actually go back to the Member States again. Of course, they do not go back at a ratio of 1:1, as Europe is not a savings bank, and we naturally pursue a policy of solidarity where we support those in the European Union that are less well developed. For example, in my state of North Rhine-Westphalia in Germany, all of the labour market instruments that are now implemented there are cofinanced by the European Social Fund. If we remove this funding, there will be correspondingly less labour market policy. That cannot be what Social Democrats are aiming for. Let us consider for a moment how the Member States spend European funds. The Court of Auditors’ annual report states that there are deficiencies in the way the management and control systems for spending European funds operate. It states that the recovery of wrongly invested funds in the Member States runs into billions of euro. It also states that the Commission is now, thankfully, going to suspend payments in cases where European programmes are being mismanaged. That is also happening for example in Germany and the United Kingdom. The Council, which is not here, represents the Member States, which I urgently call on to improve their management of EU budgetary resources. The increase in efficiency that this would make possible would allow us to considerably improve the way we spend EU funds – not by spending more money but by improving the way we spend it. The Member States can play a part in this in order to underline their willingness to make savings. Jens Geier  (S&amp;D

 Madam President, Mr Lewandowski, ladies and gentlemen, naturally, we should discuss the costs that are to be avoided or saved in this budget. However, I would call on you all to be a little more objective in your knee-jerk responses to the discussion in relation to the agencies. Why is this? Firstly, because the Committee on Budgetary Control is permanently engaged in this debate and also draws attention to ways in which cooperation between the agencies and the performance of their duties can be improved, and also because we are expecting a special report on the agencies this year from the European Court of Auditors and will then have a more objective basis for what is, at present, a somewhat ill-considered discussion, particularly with regard to the question of how the agencies are managed and how we may be able to achieve these savings. Speaking of savings, I would like to come to my next topic, our building policy. The fact is that when it comes to the buildings of the European Union, we can certainly save resources. Speaking personally, I would question whether it is really a good idea to build new buildings for the European Parliament in Brussels because this strategy really only makes sense if real estate prices in Brussels continuously rise. At present, the market would not seem to support this. If real estate prices on the market do not rise, then the option of renting rather than buying really does make sense, particularly when you walk around the European quarter with your eyes open and see how much office space is actually available to rent in the area. Which brings me to the issue of the House of European History. I believe that greater legitimacy is required here because it is not enough that to date, all the initiatives for the establishment of the House of European History are simply based on resolutions by the Bureau of this House and have no democratic legitimacy. This needs to change. Above all, we need to know how the operating costs and follow-up costs of this institution are to be covered. Jens Geier  (S&amp;D

 Mr President, Commissioner Barnier, ladies and gentlemen, we all know that the European Union does not have the best reputation. This often results from the fact that workers do not feel that the balance between freedom and security is protected or that it needs to be restored in many areas. This can be seen, for example, in the Services Directive, since it is an important driver of the internal market but also throws a spotlight on the limitations of that market at the same time. The review is therefore important. It is a complex task, and one to which Mrs Gebhardt has provided absolutely outstanding answers. There are still some challenges to be overcome, however. The Services Directive must not, under any circumstances, undermine the fundamental principle of equal pay for equal work in the same location. We must therefore carefully ensure, through all the monitoring opportunities that have been made available to us, that cross-border services, too, do not violate this principle. The point of single contact must provide fair access to the market of the country in which the service is to be provided. However, this is not only for the service providers themselves and the companies, for whom in my home city of Essen, for example, there are six officials – for four towns – who feel responsible. It is also for the workers. In that regard, it is absolutely crucial what language these points of single contact speak. In the Committee on Regional Development, we had a fairly hopeless discussion on this. In my view, the languages of the neighbouring countries should be used. Jens Geier  (S&amp;D

 Madam President, Mr Almunia, ladies and gentlemen, I would like to refer briefly to two points. One of them concerns competitiveness, which is raised in a number of different areas of the report. I would like to ask you to remember how many mining accidents we hear about in the media. This is due to the fact that mining and, in particular, coal mining is going on all over the world, but unfortunately, the safety standards elsewhere are very low when compared with those in German or other European pits. This may seem like overstating the case, but personally, I do not think much of competitiveness which is bought at the expense of miners’ lives. However, if we are looking at the consequences for industrial policy of an early exit from coal mining, I would like to say that the European mining equipment industry is competitive. I would like to invite all those people who believe that mining is an industry of the past and, in particular, Mr Klinz, to pay a visit to a mine. They will soon realise that mining uses high-tech solutions and that it is a question of whether or not we want this industry to continue to be profitable. I know that this is not what the Group of the Alliance of Liberals and Democrats for Europe wants. I am afraid that the mining machinery industry will follow mining production and move out of Europe. Jens Geier  (S&amp;D

Madam President, I would like to ask Mr van Dalen whether he is aware that the high percentages refer only to the percentage of the sample. In other words, it is not 36% of the payments that are in error, but 36% of the payments in the sample. If this is extrapolated up, the result is at least 5% in the case of the Cohesion Fund. Therefore, the billions that you referred to are not accurate amounts. Were you aware of this? Jens Geier  (S&amp;D
). 
 – (DE)
 Madam President, Mr Caldeira, Mr Šemeta, cohesion policy is the sick man of the EU budget. Last year, he was in intensive care and this year he is convalescing. However, he is far from making a full recovery and he could have a relapse at any time. More than 5% of all the cohesion policy payments were in error and 3% should not have been made at all. This amounts to around EUR 700 million. A large proportion of these erroneous payments could have been prevented by the Member States. The errors are occurring in public procurement and in the payment of cohesion funding, despite the existing control systems, which have been approved by the Commission. We need to take another careful look at these control systems. In my home country of Germany, the samples showed that all the control systems there which had been tested were only partially effective. The responsibility for managing the budget lies with the Commission. We can discuss this contradiction – errors in the Member States which are the responsibility of the Commission – in our home countries, we can explain it to the media and we can tell our citizens about it. However, in political terms, it is the job of the Commission to resolve this problem in the Member States. Mr Šemeta, you need to take control in this area and you will have our support for doing so.

Madam President, Mr Oettinger, as rapporteur for the opinion of the Committee on Budgets concerning Mrs Van Brempt’s report, I can say that the members of the committee very much welcomed this report. We have looked at it not only from a budgetary perspective, but also, to certain extent, with regard to its content and we have raised one concern, which Mrs Van Brempt was kind enough to include. This instrument is aimed at municipalities and rightly so, because this is where the greatest increases in efficiency can be achieved. However, I come from an area of Germany where the municipalities cannot take out any additional loans, because they are already too heavily in debt. This may be a problem specific to Germany, because of our local authority constitutions, but Mr Oettinger, as a former head of a Federal German state, will be only too familiar with this subject. Therefore, in Germany, we are in a position where those local authorities which should be making use of this programme are not allowed to, because the body responsible for supervising them has prevented them from taking on any further debt. We are very concerned about this. It could result in this programme being ineffective in these areas. We welcome this programme and would be pleased if it could be continued. We have called for the programme to have a separate budget line and we would like to transfer to it the EUR 15 million available in the agricultural policy area which cannot be accessed there because there is no legal basis for doing so. This is where the budget needs to be more flexible. Jens Geier  (S&amp;D

 Madam President, Mr Wathelet, Commissioner, I believe that we are all agreed, even the gentlemen and the few ladies among the Eurosceptic to anti-Europe fractions of this House, that the EU performs important tasks and that the performance of these tasks represents European added value, because the nation states either cannot perform them or the final beneficiaries would not receive this money from the nation states. The latter scenario is due, in particular, to the fact that the Member States would not invest savings, but would have to use them to reduce debt, whereas the European budget is largely an investor. Thus, if we want to achieve the goals that are set here every week, we need an ambitious budget, and that means not less money, but more money in future. In this connection, I believe it is important to emphasise that the national budgets and the European budget are complementary to one another. The Council and the Member States behave as if money that goes into the European budget more or less disappears into a large black hole. That is not the case; it is invested in goals that we have previously agreed on here. We therefore also need, as Mr Böge proposes, a critical examination of the medium-term financial programme. This, of course, can only serve to show that the Council cannot say ‘yes’ to the Treaty of Lisbon while, at the same time, putting forward one or other project for financing and then saying: but you will not get any money for its implementation. If it is not possible, then we will resort to the necessary deletions of the budget lines that Parliament does not regard as priorities. Ladies and gentlemen, we will have this discussion again and again while the EU does not have sufficient funds of its own. What is important – no, essential – is that these own resources do not impose an additional burden on normal wage earners. As a Social Democrat, I am in favour of the introduction of a financial transaction tax, because in general, this will not affect normal wage earners and it will help to put the brakes on the financial market. We firmly believe that those who triggered a crisis, the like of which we have never seen before, and the costs of which we all have to pay out of the public budgets of our own Member States, should be called on to compensate for these losses.

 Mr President, Mr Barroso, Mr Zapatero, from the point of view of those in charge of budgetary control in this House, the Spanish Presidency has made history. We are grateful that this Presidency has succeeded in removing the discharge procedure for the Council from the sphere of obscurity. Previously, the Council has refused to lay adequate accounts before the European Parliament. Sessions had, at best, an informal character. One had to collect documents bit by bit, or they were unavailable. Answers to questions were unsatisfactory. The Council would refer in all seriousness to an agreement dating from 1970, the ‘gentlemen’s agreement’, which allegedly clarifies issues concerning the discharge, although this gentlemen’s agreement spares not a single word on this matter. This has now changed. The Secretary-General of the Council has agreed to introduce a discharge procedure worthy of the name in a transparent procedure in compliance with democratic standards. This success of the Spanish Presidency testifies to the democratic and European convictions of the Spanish Government. For this, it deserves the praise of this House. Jens Geier  (S&amp;D

 Mr President, Mr Maystadt, Mr Rehn, I would first like to thank Mr Deutsch for his work. However, I would also like to take the opportunity to emphasise the importance of the European Investment Bank (EIB) for Europe and for the citizens of Europe and to highlight the fact that we must make greater use of this unique institution, in particular in times of economic crisis. From the perspective of budgetary control, which in modern terms also covers the actual output and performance of European programmes and institutions, the EIB has definitely earned its high rating, in particular with regard to political reliability. It creates real added value for the people of Europe by means of the investments made in its six main programmes, ranging from the Trans-European Networks to supporting small and medium-sized enterprises, and its special programmes, such as the project to combat climate change. I am sure that this will receive broad support in the European Parliament. However, this also means that Parliament must in future extend its own supervisory procedures. I am referring here, for example, to the investment facility. Finally, I would like to make one further point which is particularly important to my group and which is aimed directly at the EIB. We welcome the fact that the EIB has revised its policy on offshore financial centres. However, we also need the assurance that income produced from EIB funds will not make its way into tax havens of this kind, otherwise the EIB would risk damaging the reputation and the rating that it has built up. Jens Geier,

Good morning Mr President, ladies and gentlemen. I would like to repeat that, in my opinion, it is rather difficult to conduct a debate in the absence of those to whom we are supposed to grant discharge, with whom we want to discuss the reasons why we are granting discharge or are postponing discharge or whatever else we have to talk to them about. I know many of the honourable Members of this House from the committee. We also know our respective positions. It is fine that we will exchange them once again this morning, but it is not really helpful. In this context, I would like to propose that in committee, we deliberate formally inviting the institutions we are discussing to the next discharge debate and postponing the debates accordingly if they are not present. Discharge to the European institutions comes at a difficult, but important moment. A consequence of the financial crisis is that all governments are having to review their respective budgets and ensure that they are meeting their requirements. We are in the first year of a new legislative period of the European Parliament and are dealing with a newly assembled Commission. In terms of the discharge, we are, however, considering the 2008 budget, which was under the responsibility of the previous Commission. This opens a multitude of new perspectives. Among these new perspectives, we should expect a new way of thinking and a new approach on the part of the Member States since, for the first time, the Treaty of Lisbon names them as being co-responsible for the implementation of the EU budget. In terms of the 2008 budgetary review, it was the rapporteur’s intention to ensure that the Commission concentrates entirely on possibilities for improvement in budgetary control and that the Member States are on board for that as well. As the Group of the Progressive Alliance of Socialists and Democrats in the Committee on Budgetary Control, it is our goal that in future, every discharge report – on the basis of the judgment of the European Court of Auditors – is better than the previous one. It all depends on the Council assuming its new key roll in the light of the importance of the Member States. It would be equally helpful if the European Court of Auditors looked for ways of redressing the imbalance that is, on the one hand, the result of annual reporting and the multiannual duration of many EU programmes and the logic of their implementation by the Commission and the Member States. As the budgetary authority, we continue to have great concerns regarding some specific areas of responsibility, and, in particular, those in which the EU intends to implement its political priorities. For example, cohesion in the European Union is essential and therefore, the funds that flow into structural policy are particularly important. Here, we need to continue combating sources of errors decisively through simpler rules and recovering funds wrongly paid. We need finer instruments to measure results and we call on the Court of Auditors to develop these instruments, in order to be able to identify precisely the sources of errors. We know that the action plan for the structural funds that provides for recovery is finally being implemented and we must now wait for it to have an effect. Pre-accession aid has the goal of enabling fundamental processes of change in these states and problems in target setting and implementation must be remedied. What will not do, however, is the fact that the goal of the accession process is effectively being torpedoed through the back door. Therefore, I call on the House to reject the attempt by the Group of the European People’s Party (Christian Democrats) to use amendments to turn the position of the European Parliament on Turkey’s accession process on its head, as recorded in the resolution on the progress report. We are looking forward to the appointment of a new Director-General of the European Antifraud Office (OLAF) to end the ongoing debate, and also the Commission’s proposals on the reform of OLAF, in order to improve the crucial work of this office. Finally, to external policy actions. We need a demonstration of the determination of the EU to contribute to the resolution of problems worldwide. These actions must be highly effective, even under the most difficult circumstances. In the coming months, we must discuss the current management of EU funds in this area with the Commission and how these funds will be managed in future by the European External Action Service. We are, however, making some progress. Our group is particularly pleased with the steps the Commission is taking as regards the annual management reports of the Member States, for example, since we are thereby getting closer to the realisation of an old demand of the Group of the Progressive Alliance of Socialists and Democrats. The same is true for the financial corrections and recoveries, since this is also an opportunity to reduce an unacceptably high rate of errors. These points give us, among other things, the opportunity, some considerations notwithstanding, to call for the discharge of the Commission. I thank you and look forward to your comments. Jens Geier  (S&amp;D

Mr President, Commissioner, Mr López Garrido, I am delighted that you are here and so demonstrate the Council’s recognition of this important debate. Ladies and gentlemen, we all know this little trick: if you want to embarrass someone, ask them a question with a wording like, do you still actually smack your children? Even if the person says no, they have implicitly admitted that in the past, they did smack their children. The discharge report for Parliament by Mr Staes, who I would like to thank for his work, is a critical report, and to me, in some areas at least, it has followed this logic. Self-criticism is good, but it should then be accurate. I have had many discussions in my group on how we might reject this or that wording in the report on Parliament’s discharge. Some of us have come under more than a little pressure in our home countries regarding this. However, I do want to convey to you my answers to these questions as to why we have rejected some wording or other in the report on Parliament’s discharge. There are proposals that are already a reality. We could re-table them, but why? There are proposals that are not helpful, such as the idea of making the Committee on Budgetary Control a sort of alternative internal audit authority or an intermediary between the Bureau and plenary. There are many good proposals in this report that were, however, all adopted. Then there are proposals in this report that only represent a partial reality, as, for example, in Amendment 26 now on the table. This amendment demands the establishing of an internal control system in groups of this House. Nothing should be more obvious. In the Group of the Progressive Alliance of Socialists and Democrats, however, this has long been a reality, precisely for that reason. If my group were to agree to this, we would be acting as if we had some catching up to do. Therefore, we can, in this example, only agree if this reality is also illustrated in the report. I therefore propose adding the following phrase to this paragraph: as it is the fact in the S&amp;D Group. Jens Geier,  
deputising for the rapporteur.

Mr President, so that the Minutes are correct, I represent rapporteur Bogusław Liberadzki, who, like many others in this House, has been a victim of the transport problems this week. I am very happy to do so and would like to use the opportunity to go over a few of the remarks made during the debate. For a start, Commissioner Šemeta, to my great satisfaction, you have stressed that the Commission will take steps to further strengthen the accountability of the leading actors in the management of EU funds. We all know what that means. Indeed, we all know that it means that we must remind the Member States of the European Union that manage a large portion of European funds of their responsibility to do so in accordance with good practice, because we also all know that the majority of the errors that are made in the utilisation of European funds are made by the Member States and at this level. That is why it is also rather unsatisfactory to hear colleagues from the European Conservatives and Reformists Group and the Europe of Freedom and Democracy Group, all of whom, including Mr Czarnecki, have other commitments, strongly criticising the Commission in the debate and saying that the Commission will be refused discharge. I would have expected my fellow Members to support pushing for national management statements in this House and also in the Member States, because that is where mistakes are being made and there is insufficient cooperation. Then it is rather unsatisfactory to hear colleagues from the ECR Group say that everything that happens here is substandard – knowing quite well that responsibility lies somewhere else entirely. Once again, I would like to mention pre-accession aid, because I feel that a few things have to be put right there. I would like to remind you that the Committee on Budgetary Control supported the rapporteur with a slight majority. I would also like to remind you that during the reporting, the representative of the European Court of Auditors sought to remind the rapporteur that his report was about the behaviour of the Commission as regards what was deemed to be worthy of criticism, not about the behaviour of Turkey. Our fellow Members in the Group of the European People’s Party (Christian Democrats) have voted amendments into the discharge of the Commission that we would like to remove straightaway, because here it is obviously less about the utilisation of taxpayers’ money and more about the question of where accession negotiations with Turkey are going. Deciding that at this point is the wrong way to go. Jens Geier  (S&amp;D

 Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, I would like to draw the attention of the European Commission and of this House to the worrying developments with regard to the prices of raw materials. Duisburg, home of the largest steelworks in Europe, is in my constituency. Here, and in the other steel-producing locations in the EU, the employees are very concerned about their jobs because the three large suppliers of iron ore are forcing price increases of 100% on the steel industry. In future, the price of ore is to be traded on the London Metal Exchange instead of price security being ensured, as was previously the case, by means of long-term supply contracts. The workforce and its trade unions fear that this will result in an extreme rise in the price of the base material, steel. This comes at a time when the potential areas for savings by means of cost-cutting programmes and reductions in the workforce, particularly after the most recent restructuring in the steel industry, have been completely exhausted. In order to draw attention to this situation, works councils and Germany’s Industrial Union of Metalworkers have directed an appeal on behalf of Duisburg to Chancellor Merkel and to President Barroso. I would ask the Commission to respond to this appeal. Jens Geier  (S&amp;D

 Mr President, Mr Kallas, Mr Caldeira, ladies and gentlemen, firstly I would like to thank you, Mr Caldeira, for your introduction and I would like to thank you and the members of the Court of Auditors for your report. Parliament will investigate carefully the information you have provided and will act on it in the coming months. I was pleased that the previously unacceptable error rate of the common agricultural policy has fallen. However, after reading the Court of Auditors’ report, I have the impression that one Member State, namely Romania, is responsible for the majority of the remaining irregularities. It seems that we must put more emphasis in future on training staff and implementing control systems correctly in the new Member States, if possible, before their accession. The European Structural Funds, which many of my fellow Members have already mentioned, represent another cause for concern. It is true that the number of irregular payments has fallen when compared with the previous year, but there are still huge problems in ensuring that aid funding is handled without irregularities occurring. I would like to say to the Eurosceptic parts of this House that we are talking about 11% of the total payments and not 11% of the budget. This amounts to EUR 2.7 billion and not EUR 5 billion. I admit that this is still EUR 2.7 billion too much, but we must be accurate for the sake of honesty. These irregularities relate mainly to excessive payments and the incorrect use of funds. For example, if European Social Fund (ESF) money is used to pay the salary of a public administrator or if European Regional Development Fund (ERDF) money is used to buy a building plot, then the people concerned obviously do not have sufficient information about the correct use of aid funding or the Member States do not have the will or the ability to administer the funding correctly, or perhaps all of the above. When we revise the application procedure, we must put in place clear, transparent rules which are easier to understand. The Member States must ensure that the applications are monitored more carefully at a national level. It is clear that any waste or any irregularities in relation to European taxpayers’ money is too much. However, anybody who takes an impartial look at the EU and at this report from the European Court of Auditors will find little cause for offence. It offers a number of starting points for our work, which consists of making Europe better and more efficient every day. On this basis we will implement the discharge procedure for the European Commission. Jens Geier  (S&amp;D
).

 Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I, too, would like to thank Mr Søndergaard for his successful work, as a result of which the Council ultimately accommodated Parliament in the discharge procedure. The Council refused, for a long while, to provide pertinent answers to Parliament’s questions, citing the Gentlemen’s Agreement – an agreement of an informal nature which is now, in any case, 40 years old. This seems downright bizarre when Council officials, after 40 years, clearly no longer know what exactly the Gentlemen’s Agreement states, since the version provided by the European Parliament contains precisely the opposite of what the Council claimed again and again in the negotiations. The first resolution of the Gentleman’s Agreement stated that the Council would not attempt to make any changes to the European Parliament’s expenditure. The third resolution states that there should be close cooperation between the two institutions on budget issues. The Council takes this to mean that each institution will leave the budgetary activity of the other alone. At this point, I will refrain from commenting on the seriousness of this line of argument. Instead, I would like to thank the Swedish Presidency of the Council for having begun the process of bringing an end to this ignoble state of affairs. The solution is an addendum to the interinstitutional agreement that clearly regulates the procedure for the granting of discharge to the Council by Parliament, as the proposed motion for a resolution demands. I therefore ask the House to support the motion. Jo Leinen  (S&amp;D

After 30 years of civil war there was a lot of chaos in Sri Lanka and colleagues have said that there are improvements but not enough. But you are speaking about a balanced resolution and you are calling for a comprehensive investigation by March 2014 – that is three months from now. Do you think that is realistic? Why do you impose such an ultimatum, rather than stating ‘in due time’, as you yourself said? March 2014 is completely unrealistic – do you not agree? Jo Leinen,

 Mr President, I am a member of Parliament’s delegation to India, and I love the people and the country. But, like all of us, I was shocked by the atrocity of this gang rape against a young student. Sexual violence against women is, unfortunately, a widespread phenomenon in India, especially in the capital, Delhi. The rape of this young girl is only the tip of the iceberg.  In our resolution we ask the Indian Government to investigate the cases of persons occupying senior official posts – up to the top levels of the Parliament and the government – against whom formal accusations of rape are outstanding, and call for those persons to give up their public functions. We call upon the Indian authorities to take effective measures to train police forces to handle rape cases better, and we call for the Indian criminal law to be amended to punish all forms of sexual assault. The European Union and the Member States should work with Indian authorities on special campaigns and programmes to combat gender-based violence. More has to be done to protect women and to implement Article 51 of the Indian Constitution, which forbids any practice against the dignity of women. Parliament’s delegation visits India in early May, and I am sure we will address this issue with our partners in the Indian Parliament. Jo Leinen  (S&amp;D

 Mr President, Mr Potočnik, in view of the enormous challenges facing nature and the environment, as well as the planet’s ecosystems, it must be admitted that the Rio conference is a missed opportunity. I see the glass as half empty rather than half full because the world continues to be ravaged and we have still failed to identify sufficient specific objectives and schedules or concrete obligations to enable us to change course in favour of sustainable development. The shift in power evident in Rio has been remarkable. It is interesting that an emerging economy like Brazil, supported by China and India, should present a document without there being the opportunity to change it. I would have liked to have seen more courage from Europe – acting together with the African Union perhaps – in support of the United Nations Environment Programme (UNEP), exerting more pressure so that the UNEP would become a UN organisation. What happens next? Of course we have our hopes. I believe that hopes spring from the grass roots: green cities and green business. The Rio conference hosted more mayors and more CEOs than any previous environmental summit. We should identify the urban environment as a focus area in the seventh EU Environmental Action Programme. The majority of people now live in cities, which is where the greatest amount of energy and most resources are consumed, providing a good starting point. The same applies to progressive enterprises. They have understood that it is only possible to do business when the fundamental structures for commerce are in place. We need to establish an alliance with green business. We in Parliament also need to take action. The UN has established eight major groups: business, urban areas, women, trade unions, etc. Parliaments also need to become more involved, which is why it was a pity that we did not have an official delegation at the conference. We should form a major group at UN conferences under the ‘parliaments’ banner. Jo Leinen  (S&amp;D

 Mr President, it is, in any case, a bad habit that we have here in Parliament that a text is read out for one or two minutes and people cannot speak on one or two thoughts without notes. That has annoyed me ever since I joined the European Parliament. However, I will use my time for the subject in hand. Mr Potočnik, you quite rightly described the 2050 energy road map as a great transformation for our economy and society, for production and consumption. For this great transformation, you need all the players, and at all levels. I think it is good that you are establishing a platform for resource efficiency in Brussels. We ought to have the same thing at the level of the Member States and the regions, right down to municipalities. My question is this: do you have a plan for this? Mr Bütikofer rightly asked about resource efficiency plans. That is the same subject. For climate protection, we have the National Adaptation Programmes of Action (NAPAs) and the Nationally Appropriate Mitigation Actions (NAMAs). Naturally, we also need resource efficiency plans here. Do you intend to present this to the Member States? Then, of course, you will need all the other portfolios. I will simply mention the finance ministers – this has already been mentioned: the phasing out of environmentally harmful subsidies, the incorporation of external costs into our tax system. How can we win over the finance ministers and, not least, the ministers for economic affairs? We need new business models that reward sustainability and not the consumption of resources. For that, we need to think about something new with the ministers for economic affairs. (The speaker agreed to take a blue-card question under Rule 149(8)) Jo Leinen  (S&amp;D

 Thank you for your follow-up question, Ms Merkies. In fact, the traditional business model is built upon the consumption, and even the wasting, of resources. The manufacturer produces something, does not deal with the waste, the product goes to the consumer and perhaps also ends up being thrown away. That is no longer acceptable. We need a new business model in which the manufacturer is responsible – from production through to recovery, to recycling. Then, I believe, there will be new designs for products. There are new responsibilities for recirculation. That is the direction we must move in. Jo Leinen,

 Mr President, Mr Potočnik, ladies and gentlemen, the European Parliament wants to introduce a 7th Environment Action Programme (EAP) in the European Union. It would not make sense for us to give up our efforts to improve the quality of the environment and of health in Europe when the 6th EAP comes to an end in June. However, the 7th EAP must not be a copy of the 6th programme. We have come much further along the road and we are facing much bigger challenges. We need to take a new approach in the 7th EAP: a horizontal approach covering all other areas of policy. We are exposed to systemic risks. Mr Potočnik, you have just mentioned the fact that climate change, the loss of biodiversity and the shortage of resources are all challenges which cannot be overcome by traditional environmental policy alone. We need to involve all the other portfolios and all the other policy areas in the EU and, in particular, energy and transport policy, agriculture and fisheries policy, cohesion policy and, most importantly, economic and financial policy. I would like to emphasise this point, because this is the most difficult aspect. How can we ensure that the finance and economy ministers treat greening as a central issue within their areas? Parliament has drafted 80 paragraphs containing proposals for the content and the procedure for a 7th EAP and these include calls for the abolition of subsidies which harm the environment. Following the greening of tax policy, we must incorporate external costs in our prices. The principle that the polluter pays must be applied gradually. As part of our macro-economic controls, we also need to monitor sustainability within the European Semester. We have come up with many other ideas in this area. Europe’s environmental footprint as a whole is far too large. If all the 7 billion people on this planet today and the 9 billion that there will be by the middle of the century were to use as much energy and as many resources as we do, we would need two planets, not just one. We know that there are limits to the resources which our planet can provide. For this reason, we need to make major cuts in our resource consumption. The 7th EAP must open the door to a green economy and to a policy of resource efficiency. We need to focus, in particular, on urban environments. More and more people are living in large conurbations and in these areas, we can set a good example of resource management and resource efficiency. Green cities are our objective in Europe. There are many good examples and best practices which must be applied everywhere. Of course, protecting the environment should also help us to protect people’s health. We must send out a clear message to the public that protecting the environment and public health form an integral part of the 7th EAP. This will help to ensure that it gains acceptance. There are still a number of difficulties in this area. Air pollution levels are still too high and noise pollution is a huge problem. Noise is an issue that has been neglected and completely underrated in our environmental policy. There are still many toxic chemicals that make their way into the environment and have an impact on health. Nanomaterials and other new materials need careful investigation and also present us with new challenges. The best legislation and the best programmes are useless if they are not implemented. The 7th EAP must resolve the problem of the implementation deficit. Ultimately, I believe that Europe must send a message to the world that we need sustainable management. Otherwise, the human race will not survive on earth. Jo Leinen,  
rapporteur.

 Mr President, the debate has shown that there is a consensus in favour of the 7th Environment Action Programme (EAP) within the European Parliament. I would like to thank all the shadow rapporteurs who have helped us to reach this consensus. I would also like to thank Mr Potočnik, who took the initiative within the Commission, because not everyone there supported the 7th EAP at first sight. It is clear that there was a certain level of resistance. Following the debate in the Council of Environment Ministers and in the European Parliament, it is clear how useful and how important a 7th EAP can be, because it brings together all the objectives which were previously spread across different strategies and road maps. The amalgamation of these objectives, the message that Europe’s environmental footprint must be reduced and the measures needed to achieve this are the main points of the 7th EAP. I would like to say once again that we need to address our calls to the finance and economy ministers. I hope that the report will not be watered down during the vote later today. We must call for the greening of tax policy and economic policy because we will not be able to make our economy sustainable by means of environmental policy alone. This point has been made in many of today’s speeches. The environmental strategy must be reflected in the finance strategy. We will soon be debating the medium-term financial plan up to 2020 and the Commission has proposed putting aside for climate change and sustainability 20% of the billions of euro available. I believe that this should be a minimum and I hope that Parliament can increase this figure during the negotiations. We must not allow 80% of the funding to be devoted to areas that go against the environment and only 20% to be used to protect the environment. Overall, this has been an important debate and we are looking forward to your draft, Mr Potočnik. This will go into the ordinary legislative procedure where it will be finalised. We will help to ensure that the result is an ambitious programme. Jo Leinen  (S&amp;D

 Mr Casini, would you agree that, if it accedes to the Convention on Human Rights, the EU must then support the provision of better facilities for the Court in Strasbourg? We know that the judges are completely overloaded and have poorer facilities than the judges in Luxembourg. The EU should – and I am asking you whether you agree with this – ensure that they have the same working conditions, the same standards and the same facilities, as then we can also hope for sound judgments. Would you come out in favour of Parliament and the EU supporting better facilities for the Court in Strasbourg? Jo Leinen,

 Mr President, Commissioner, climate protection requires immediate measures, as well as a long-term strategy if we are to achieve the objective of stabilising the Earth’s atmosphere at 2 °C. The Group of the Progressive Alliance of Socialists and Democrats in the European Parliament supports your Roadmap for 2050. It is an extremely important element in guaranteeing planning certainty and clarity in relation to where the path is to take us. All those involved, particularly the economic sector, eagerly await this planning certainty and clarity. This makes it all the more regrettable that Friday’s Environment Council meeting was blocked by one country, showing itself to be incapable of making political decisions. I would like to ask the Commission: what is your strategy for rescuing Poland from this psychological and political isolation? We need Poland. Poland is an important country. We need to make it clear that Poland also has enormous opportunities to modernise its economy and deploy new technology in pursuing its climate strategy. Perhaps it is necessary to clarify the assistance the EU can offer and the way in which the effort is distributed among all 27 countries, all of which share a common goal, but which may have different ways of reaching that goal. Commissioner, you must be able to provide an answer here. If we want to reduce CO2
 emissions by 80 to 95%, we need to embrace all sectors, not just industry, but also transport and agriculture. I hope that the amendments tabled here will not dilute our report. We need to speak out clearly in relation to climate neutrality in the transport sector and in favour of major efforts in the agricultural sector. We would encourage you to include not just aviation, but also marine transport in the emissions trading system. You need to show leadership here, and you should not give in. The Emissions Trading System is not working. You need to take corrective action. This report indicates how this can work. I believe, in the final analysis, that we are witnessing a new industrial revolution. The issue at stake is a competitive European economy and climate protection is a key element in the competitiveness of Europe in the 21st century. Jo Leinen  (S&amp;D

 Mr President, I am opposed to the motion. This is a complete surprise from the Group of the European People’s Party (Christian Democrats). We have discussed the motion in the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Food Safety. We have the advantage of excellent groundwork by the Committee on Industry, Research and Energy and the Committee on Agriculture and Rural Development and have discussed this in detail this morning. The Commission and industry at large must know how matters are to proceed with regard to climate protection. I am in favour of voting on this matter today. Jo Leinen,

 Mr President, Ms Hedegaard, the Group of the Progressive Alliance of Socialists and Democrats in the European Parliament would also like to congratulate you on your handling of the negotiations in Durban. The EU has demonstrated its strong leadership skills and this has paid off. I am also pleased about the climate diplomacy and the coalition of 120 states. I would like to see China joining our strategic coalition, alongside Africa. China is moving towards taking over worldwide responsibility. This would send out a signal to the US to bring an end to its policy of denial and to join the mainstream of international climate policy. We have prevented a fiasco and we have produced the road map which we will have to work on. There is, of course, a great deal for us to do at home. We have the gigatonne gap and if Europe wants to play a leading role, it will have to do more than it has in the past. I hope that there will be new initiatives which go beyond 20%. We must take the hot air out of Kyoto 2. The policy cannot really be credible with all these surplus certificates. I would like to encourage you to remain tough in the areas of aviation and shipping and to take new initiatives. It is totally absurd that the US Congress can pass a law banning airlines from taking part in our legislation. We must not allow this to happen and Parliament would like to see you maintaining your tough stance. Jo Leinen,

 Mr President, Ms Maćkowiak-Pandera, Ms Hedegaard, ladies and gentlemen, this week, the European Parliament is submitting a resolution which includes comprehensive proposals on combating global climate change. Mr President, I know that you are committed to overcoming climate change and it would, of course, be good if you could come with the parliamentary delegation to Durban. However, I understand the constraints you are under here in the House with regard to the 2012 budget. Nevertheless, a strong delegation will be going to Durban ready to exert pressure and to use its lobbying skills, so that the process of combating climate change does not come to a halt and so that we can continue to make progress. I would like to thank the sponsors from the five groups who have drawn up this resolution. There was a broad consensus in the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Food Safety about what should now be done and we had the support of the Committee on Development and the Committee on Industry, Research and Energy. Parliament has clear ideas about what we need to achieve in the 17th Conference of the Parties (COP 17) to the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC). We have no time to lose. The extreme weather events in 2011 alone and the melting of the glaciers and icebergs show that climate change is well under way. This is why we need to make substantial progress at the COP 17. Parliament’s goal remains the same: a legally binding instrument for all states in the UNFCCC or a global climate agreement, if you want to call it that. We will not be able to achieve this in Durban, but we need to establish further milestones on the road to a global climate agreement. This is primarily about meeting the promises and the undertakings which were made last year in Cancún. I will only mention the mechanism for technology transfer from rich northern countries to poorer southern ones and the institutions which will put in place the necessary measures to allow us to adapt to climate change. However, there are other open issues which we can hopefully resolve in Durban. One of these concerns closing the gigatonne gap. In Cancún, everyone agreed that we want to limit the global temperature increase to 2 degrees Celsius, but the commitments that are already on the table are not sufficient. We will end up with an increase of 3.5 or 4 degrees Celsius, which is much too much, as we all know. Therefore, we need to understand how the gigatonne gap can be closed on the basis of common but differing responsibilities for stabilising the earth’s atmosphere. We in Parliament are of the opinion that greenhouse gas emissions will peak in 2015 and this is a very ambitious goal. However, the scientists are telling us that we have to reach this point during this decade. We know that by 2050, we must reduce our greenhouse gas emissions by around 50%, which is a huge task. In Durban, the focus is likely to be on the Kyoto Protocol. We must prevent a gap from occurring between the first commitment period and a further second commitment period. Therefore, we need a solution for the period after 2012 and Parliament is calling on the EU to give its clear support to a second commitment period. We know that we do not have many partners, but they include Switzerland and Norway, together with Australia and New Zealand. I believe that with effective climate change diplomacy, we can achieve a critical mass which will make it worthwhile to implement Kyoto II and, at the same time and most importantly, to force the emerging countries and also the USA to commit to a timetable involving everyone. The idea is that we will succeed in implementing an overarching climate agreement in 2015. I would like to mention an issue that we are all aware of: the funding for combating global climate change. We hope that we can establish a Green Climate Fund in Durban, but we need to know who will manage it, who can become a member, how it will work and where the funding will come from. Parliament has made a number of suggestions including the income from emissions trading, taxes on aviation and shipping and the financial transaction tax, if it is imposed. I shall be brief. We must not use the economic crisis as an excuse for doing nothing. The message that comes out of Durban must make it clear that we cannot allow climate change to overcome the human race. Instead, the human race must have the determination to overcome climate change. That is the message that the European Parliament is taking to South Africa. Jo Leinen,

 Mr President, President-in-Office of the Council, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Food Safety here in the European Parliament, in the ‘citizens’ chamber’ of the European Union, is tabling a motion for a resolution in order to raise awareness of the threat to public health caused by the resistance of bacteria to antibiotics and to call on the Commission and the Member States to establish an action programme to combat this threat to public health. I am the Chair of the committee, not the author of this resolution, and you can see that we had sponsors from all political parties. We are in agreement in the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Food Safety that we have a ticking time bomb here, a major problem for the health of our citizens, and that there is an urgent need for action. We need an action plan, because the health authorities in Europe are alarmed. During visits this year to the European Medicines Agency (EMA) in London and also to the European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control (ECDC) in Stockholm, our attention was once again drawn by these specialist agencies of the European Union to this problem in particular. In the EU, around 25 000 people a year are now dying of infections caused by resistant bacteria. If we look at the situation, up to the end of the 1970s there was a great deal of activity in the pharmaceuticals industry aimed at developing new molecules and new agents. Since the end of the 1970s, the activity has diminished and come to a standstill. So, if you like, we stopped focusing on this problem 40 years ago. We are simply lacking new agents to fight this resistance. Commissioner Dalli, at this point the first demand that I am going to make is directed at you as the Commissioner responsible, and it is a call on the Commission to draw up a road map with the industry concerned in order to show more commitment to the search for and development of new molecules and new agents. Together with the actors involved in research and industry, you should draw up this road map so that we can obtain a new protection mechanism. We have mentioned a second issue, with regard to which we would ask you – as well as the Member States – to be actively engaged. Antibiotics help to reduce diseases, but if they are not used properly they can also cause damage. We have discovered that antibiotics are used entirely differently in the 27 Member States of the European Union. The Eurobarometer survey has shown how much ignorance there is. Of the people questioned, 53% believe that antibiotics kill viruses and 43% believe that antibiotics are effective against colds and flu. We can imagine how great the misuse of these substances must be, which then contributes to the resistance and puts other people at risk. We are therefore calling on the Commission to define general principles and best practices for the prudent use of antibiotics for 500 million people, for all 27 Member States, and also to ensure that these guidelines are actually implemented and put into practice everywhere in the European Union. We need a major awareness campaign in this area. We believe that we also need a well-functioning monitoring and surveillance system in this sector. The ECDC in Stockholm is our sectoral authority. We need good data, sound surveys and, of course, also analyses of trends and early warnings of the spread of such resistance. Ladies and gentlemen, there is one final issue that we have addressed in a serious way: the cross-transmission of resistance from animals to humans. Antibiotics are used in veterinary medicine as well as human medicine. There are strong indications that crossovers exist. That means that we need cooperation with veterinary medicine in this regard, above all in order to reduce and prohibit the prophylactic use of antibiotics in intensive livestock farming. In this regard, Commissioner, I hope that our resolution will also serve as a mandate for you as well as for the Polish Presidency to take action so that we can protect our citizens against this new threat to health. (Applause) Jo Leinen  (S&amp;D

– Mr President, I want to make a clarification on paragraph 8 because the formulation is misleading. It reads now in the old text ‘is concerned about the focus given to the green economy as one of the two main themes of the Rio Summit’ – ‘is concerned’ seems to be negative, so it should be ‘concerning the focus given to the green economy as one of the two main themes of the Rio Summit’. This is my oral amendment, not ‘is concerned’, but ‘concerning’. This is not negative, we want the green economy. That is the explanation to the Greens who asked me whether this is positive or negative – it is positive. Jo Leinen  (S&amp;D

 Mr President, Mr Barroso, you have called for a renaissance of the European idea. I believe that we agree that the European idea is good, but it requires a new foundation and a new profile to explain why we need Europe and also more Europe in the 21st century. As the Chair of the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Food Safety, one thing is clear to me. Europe must become a stability union from an environmental perspective and not just from a financial perspective. Young people understand above all that with 9 billion of us living on the planet by the middle part of the century, we will be fighting for energy, raw materials and food. Therefore, let us establish a European pact for environmental stability which includes energy efficiency, the efficient use of resources and sustainability. We have started to do this and it must not be allowed to get lost or be given a lower priority during the crisis. These problems will not go away. They will remain and they may even become more pronounced. Please encourage the whole of the Commission to make progress with the environmental profile of the EU. We will have the young people of Europe behind us. Jo Leinen,

 Mr President, President-in-Office of the Council, Professor Kraszewski, Ms Hedegaard, Mr Potočnik, ladies and gentlemen, the European Parliament very much welcomes the fact that the United Nations is holding the Rio+20 conference. We are submitting a resolution to the European Parliament which has been sponsored by Members from a number of different political groups, in other words, it has broad support in this House, and which states that this Earth summit next year in Brazil must be a success. If we look back 20 years to the first Rio conference in 1992, there was a huge amount of commitment and hope that we would be able to reverse the trend in our economic activities on this planet. When we consider what has happened over the last 20 years, there has certainly been a lot of commitment. Some things have been achieved, but the trends and the megatrends are still going in the wrong direction. If we look at the economy, and we discussed it at length this morning, we can see that a financial economy has developed alongside the real economy, which is far more powerful than the traditional economy. The speculation in the financial economy is threatening the real economy and also jeopardising whole countries and regions and many, many people. If we look at developments in the social sector over the last 20 years, there is incredible wealth and unfortunately also incredible poverty. The divide between rich and poor is getting wider. If we move on to the environment, it is clear that our environmental footprint on this planet is still a negative one. Over the last 20 years we have cleared huge areas of forest. We have overfished the seas. We have used up energy resources which took millions of years to form. We have damaged the soil. These are warning signs for the 21st century which indicate to us that we cannot go on like this. There must be a change of direction. We really need to make a renewed attempt to introduce sustainable development. We need a new departure next year in Rio. We need a new political will and a new sense of commitment. We also need an agenda with concrete proposals. It is clear that the three pillars – the economy, the environment and social development – must be better integrated. Economic activities are a good thing, but the economy must serve people and the environment. An economy which destroys people and the environment is not a good economy. We must redefine our economic activities in this broader context. Parliament has made a number of proposals about what is needed: the creation of the right basic conditions, regulation, but also marketable instruments, which will help the economies in our countries to bring in private capital, and the management of natural capital in order to prevent it from being overused and to intervene when ecosystems are exploited. The balance sheet for our activities is the gross domestic product or GDP. We know that GDP is no longer adequate, because it does not tell the whole truth about our activities from an environmental and social perspective. This is why we believe that the leitmotif for the next few years, for the next decade, must be a sustainable economy, a low-carbon, resource-efficient economy. We know that people all over the world do not have fair access to resources. We see large estates being bought up and in many countries, including in Africa, there is the risk that people will no longer be able to cultivate their own food as a result of land theft. This is a phenomenon which we need to devote our attention to. It is clear that many people do not have access to energy. Around 2 billion people have no proper, regular energy supply, which is a huge disadvantage in terms of development. Access to water is by no means evenly distributed all over the world. I only want to mention these three issues. However, there are other obstacles which prevent people from accessing resources easily because they are poor, underprivileged or have other problems. To make sustainable development possible, we need to shift the burden of taxes paid by the citizens of our countries. Currently the major part of the tax burden relates to the work which is done and it is clear that this tax burden must be reduced and shifted from work to the consumption of natural resources and energy. This is an important subject for which we also need the support of the finance ministers and ministers of economic affairs in the Member States. I would like to say in conclusion that sustainability requires commitment from the local level through to the global level. Civil society is a very important resource. People must take part and we must involve them. The state has a job to do, but the private sector also has responsibilities. We must ensure that the private sector does more to make use of its knowledge and expertise in the service of sustainability. At a global level, we simply need better governance, a better structure, in order to organise these environmental and sustainable trends. In Rio we will be discussing whether the United Nations environment programme (UNEP) is adequate in its current form. The answer is clear: it is not. We need better structures at a global level. We in Parliament are hoping that the EU will speak with one voice. We will have a delegation in Durban and we will help to ensure that Europe sets itself a genuine target and plays a pioneering role. We need an agenda 2020 for sustainable development on this planet. Jo Leinen,

Madam President, Commissioner, we, too, welcome your communication on improving civil protection in the European Union. Citizens in Europe expect us to respond quickly and efficiently in the event of a disaster and, above all, to help each other. In the past, we have sometimes sat helpless in front of the television watching forest fires in southern Europe and asked ourselves: why are the others not helping? Your communication now represents the next step towards European solidarity and the efficient use of the capacities that we have in Europe. We have everything that we need. We really do have all of the facilities we need to deal with disasters in Europe. In that respect, this is a positive step forward. As a previous speaker said, national capacities should not be replaced by centralisation at EU level, but we do need to exploit synergies. We really do need everyone to act swiftly together. This is also urgently needed now. I also agree that we need to think more and more in terms of prevention. We need to deal in the right way with the information that we have and must not wait until a disaster has occurred. We can do a great deal with regard to flooding or potential droughts, where fires frequently break out. I am pleased that we will now organise civil protection, both in the EU and also outside the EU, in a coherent way. I agree with Mr Seeber: the areas of responsibility ought to be clear. You are responsible. You ought to accept that responsibility and not permit the areas of responsibility to be mixed up so that we no longer know who is responsible. Finally, I believe that this 24/7 preparedness must always be ensured, including at Christmas, during New Year, on public holidays, and during the summer, too. That is very important. I would like to thank Ms Gardini for her excellent report. Jo Leinen  (S&amp;D

 Madam President, Mr Søndergaard, if we have a list of 25 candidates, these candidates will clearly not all come from a single country, but from 25 countries. Each party will arrange it that way.

 Madam President, 30 years after the first direct election to the European Parliament, we need a fundamental reform of the electoral system. The shortcomings of the European elections are clear. We must not stagnate, we must not stand still; instead, we must take the next step forward. The next step is indeed this strategic instrument of European lists alongside the national lists. Democracy involves discourse and deliberation, as Professor Habermas used to say. That is exactly our problem. The political class has a national system of discourse. The debates remain in the national realm. We have no overarching European debate, no European political realm, and the European lists would force the political class to come together and to think in European terms, to argue from a European point of view and also to make the alternatives clear to citizens with regard to the forms of Europe they have to choose from in the elections. I hope that we will succeed in implementing these European lists with your report, Mr Duff. We need this vision, and we should not give in. Parliament has already taken a decision in this regard once before, and we cannot be less ambitious than our predecessors. Jo Leinen  (S&amp;D

 Mr President, Mr Dalli, ladies and gentlemen, Europe’s response to genetically modified (GM) crops is different from that of North and South America. We know that GM crops are widely grown not only in the USA and Canada, but also in Argentina and Brazil. However, Eurobarometer surveys show that the opinions of the large majority of the people of Europe on this subject range from scepticism to opposition. For this reason, it would be wrong for Brussels to force the Member States to accept GM crops. It would not be the right thing to do and it would not be accepted. I believe that Parliament and the Commission are moving towards transferring the responsibility and the competence for this area to the Member States. Each country must decide for itself whether or not it wants to introduce genetically modified plants into the environment. It is rather regrettable that we do not have unity within Europe, but that is the reality of the situation. I think that this approach is the right one because the countries which do not want genetically modified organisms (GMOs) should not be forced to use them. Now we need legal certainty concerning the grounds on which GMOs can be opposed. The Commission has referred to some of the reasons, but these are not enough. A number of gaps remain. Mrs Lepage’s report fills precisely these gaps in the environmental aspects. We have totally different ecosystems and different approaches to the environment. This report is definitely a step in the right direction and I hope it is successful. We will be supporting it in any case. What we also need is freedom of choice for farmers and for consumers. Mr Dalli, we urgently need a regulation concerning the distance between GMO fields and conventional crops. First of all, though, Mrs Lepage’s report must achieve a majority in plenary tomorrow.

 Mr President, I would like to inform the House that voting in favour of the first part of the next amendment would mean voting against the energy and climate package of 2008. We have a lot of studies from the Commission showing that fulfilling the climate package means a 25 % reduction, so I would like to ask the House to vote against this amendment. Jo Leinen  (S&amp;D

 Madam President, Mr Oettinger, ladies and gentlemen, the Group of the Progressive Alliance of Socialists and Democrats in the European Parliament supports Mr Eickhout’s report because it sends out a strong message both internally and externally that we are not giving up on combating climate change. It is an internal signal that we are taking seriously the promise made in the 2008 climate package of 20% renewable energy and 20% energy savings. Mr Oettinger, you have presented us with a proposal today and we have a great deal of work ahead of us. Both of these measures together will result in a 25% reduction in CO2
 emissions within the EU. Who could be opposed to this? It is not possible, because it is a package of legislation which we have adopted. In addition, we have a responsibility to the rest of the world. We also have to achieve a level of 5% clean development mechanisms (CDMs). That makes a total of 30%. I hope that this will not be watered down. The amendment to paragraph 3 would destroy the entire report. If this amendment is passed, we will be voting against the report tomorrow. I hope that this will not be the case, because we need to send out a strong signal. Jo Leinen  (S&amp;D

Madam President, Mr Oettinger, the stress tests are necessary and also long overdue. It is surprising that they have not been carried out before. You should take the credit for the fact that all the nuclear power stations in the EU are finally going to be inspected. However, we must admit that we are skating on very thin ice with these stress tests. You have rightly said that several countries were not prepared to take part in a European inspection procedure. Of course, there is the risk that the inspection will differ from country to country. Some will not want to include aircraft crashes and others will only open up a part of their plants for stress tests. You need to make sure that the tests are genuinely comprehensive. It is also clear that you have not made a comprehensive evaluation. The area of human failure is incomplete. The risk now and in future is not that an aircraft will accidentally crash on a nuclear power plant, but that there will be targeted attacks on these plants from outside. That is precisely what is not being tested. I live on the border with France and Luxembourg and there are four nuclear power stations in Cattenom. We have been told that the fire service and the police are responsible for them. I imagine that al-Qaeda and other terrorists will almost die laughing when they find out that the fire service and the police are responsible for preventing the threat of terrorism. This really must be included in the stress test. Finally, what will the consequences be if you find errors and weak points? There is the risk that we will not be able to do anything at a European level and that it will all come to nothing. Will some of the power plants really be shut down or modernised? It is high time that the Euratom Treaty was revised. This situation, where we have no influence over the safety of nuclear power stations, cannot continue. Jo Leinen  (S&amp;D

 Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, farmers can be compensated, but human life cannot be recovered. Indeed, our sympathy goes out to all those who have died or are lying in a hospital bed. This situation is dramatic and it is also unacceptable. It is unacceptable that three weeks after the outbreak of this crisis, we still do not know exactly where the pathogen that caused the crisis originated. That really should not happen in Europe. There are several lessons we need to learn from this. Firstly, we need to look for the source and examine whether improper practices are still present in the food production sector or in the food supply chain. We have legislation that has been in place for 20 years, and the standards and codes of practices in the European Union are quite stringent, but it is clear that we are still vulnerable when it comes to foodstuffs. There still seem to be gaps and shortcomings and we need to learn from this once again. I also think that the communication on this matter has been chaotic. Facts about this matter are not communicated well or in the right way. We clearly need more Europe. That has already been said by other Members here. When any regional or national authority issues a warning for the whole of Europe, it can only be a disaster. In my view, the European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control (ECDC) has done a good job, as far as I can see, but we need a better, modern reporting obligation for determining the causes and also a better system for informing the general public. Jo Leinen,  
rapporteur.

 Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, today we are debating, and tomorrow we will adopt, European legislation that, on first impression, seems rather unremarkable, but with this law on European environmental economic accounts, we are probably opening a new chapter in the measurement of progress and prosperity. We have known for a long time that gross national product is inadequate. The purely quantitative view of economic activity says nothing about the environmental balance sheet, nor about the social balance sheet, and therefore it is high time that we measured whether, year on year, we are doing well or badly in terms of our measures and efforts. We have monthly statistics relating to our labour market figures and we have annual statistics relating to our economic figures. We therefore know exactly what is happening in these areas. However, we have an incomplete patchwork of data on the environmental impact. This law on environmental economic accounts is intended to help us to draw up an accurate balance sheet in the 27 Member States and to establish whether we are making progress or, as is often the case, whether we are going backwards. As long ago as 2002, Parliament called for reliable information to be collected on the state of the environment and the most important trends in, influences on, and causes of, environmental change, and for the public to be informed of these things. We want a scientifically sound concept for measuring the consumption of resources to enable appropriate political decisions to be taken. We are pleased that the Commission took this legislative initiative in April 2010, but in our opinion, it was much too tentative in the way it went about it. We in Parliament and all of the groups have called for this to be done much more quickly, because the Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD) and the United Nations have already been discussing these matters for 15 years. This is taking far too long. We have therefore made considerable progress in the negotiations with the Council. It was a very difficult situation in the Council, because some Member States do not produce an environmental balance sheet and we first need to create a foundation in all 27 Member States. The Commission proposed the inclusion of three modules. These modules are air emissions – in this regard, we are very well aware of which gases are emitted into the air. Then there is the financial expenditure arising from environmental taxes and environmental charges. Thirdly, there are the year-on-year national material flows, the input and output, measured in purely quantitative terms. This is a start, perhaps, but it is too simple a start, and Parliament has called for us also to produce water, energy and waste balance sheets and to find out about the status of our forests. These are the modules that we urgently want to see in the very near future. There was disagreement about whether statistics can also be produced for the marine environment, in other words, statistics on the status of fish stocks. In this regard, our methodology is probably still in need of improvement. Thus, we have achieved improvements in this area. In two years’ time – by 2013 at the latest – the Commission is to present a report and, where possible, also propose a revision of this directive. I hope that, at the end of this decade, we will have a green national product in addition to the gross national product. That is our goal. Jo Leinen,  
rapporteur.

 Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, thank you for the debate. I see broad support for the creation of environmental balance sheets in the European Union. With a few exceptions, this has found favour here. I also agree with Mrs Kadenbach’s statement. Many of us thought that this was already in place, and we were surprised to find that a lot of data does not exist at all, and that in the statements we make with regard to the state of the environment in the European Union, we are therefore actually completely blind. One Member, Mr Gerbrandy, said that measurement brings knowledge. We then know something, and knowledge is the basis for taking measures and for all of our programmes. We quite simply need a better basis for the decisions that we take. These environmental accounts can help us in this regard. Of course, we have the EU 2020 strategy, in which sustainability is a planning goal. I hope that in the next few years, we will also have this basis so that in 2020, we will be able to see whether we were successful or not. We know that gross domestic product provides no information on the state of the natural world and the environment, on resources that we have used, or on the whole sustainability problem. That is why this is now necessary. We are also tackling this in stages. Mrs Klaß, we are not making excessive demands; rather, the modules are to be expanded gradually. After all, as the Commissioner said, the individual pieces of legislation – the water legislation, waste legislation and clean air legislation – already contain the requirement to collect this data. Europe is also under a global obligation, Mr Nuttall. If we sign the Convention on Biological Diversity, the Convention on Climate Change or any other convention, we must be able to tell the rest of the world whether we have done well or badly. Thus, all in all, I would like to thank the shadow rapporteurs and also Eurostat, which will subsequently have to carry out the work. I hope that the necessary resources will be available in Luxembourg, because without funds, without resources, this balance sheet cannot, of course, be produced. Parliament should also help out in this regard. Thank you very much. This is an important political matter – as some people have rightly recognised – and it is a new chapter in the consideration of what we do in Europe year in year out. Jo Leinen,  
on behalf of the S&amp;D Group.

 Madam President, Mrs Győri, Mr Dalli, ladies and gentlemen, I have been involved in many negotiation processes here in Parliament, but the 12 hours of this conciliation procedure, which lasted from 19:00 to 07:00 the next morning, will remain in my memory for a long time. This was a very special event. Unfortunately, the two sides came from different planets. Parliament’s approach was clear, which was to focus on the interests of consumers and of the citizens of the EU. Others were considering the interests of the meat and agriculture industries. Because of these divergent approaches, we were not able to reach an agreement. This is a pity, because we now have a gap in the EU food legislation which we need to close very quickly. We were all relatively clear about this, including Mr Pittella, who acted as chair, and the rapporteur. The entire team was pulling together. Now we need to take the next step. We must fill this gap. Mr Dalli, you must present two proposals: one on novel foods, because we have almost reached a consensus on this with regard to nanomaterials, the centralised approval process and imports from third countries. The other proposal concerns cloning. You have listened to everything that we have to say on this subject. We do not want these products on the European market. At the very least, we want them to be labelled, because consumers should have freedom of choice. That is your job and Parliament is ready to support you. I hope you will be able to submit a proposal very soon. Jo Leinen,  
on behalf of the S&amp;D Group

 Mr President, Mr Oettinger, ladies and gentlemen, I would like to thank Mr Sonik for triggering this debate and for preparing the oral question. I agree that we should never forget the Chernobyl disaster. We are well aware that the long-term consequences of the catastrophe are still being experienced a full quarter century later. There is still a large uninhabitable area, so that people can no longer return to their homes. Then there is the long-term impact on health. Television has shown us that women still suffer miscarriages 25 years after the disaster. Europe shares some of the responsibility because the issue of nuclear safety is not a matter of national sovereignty, but rather one of European responsibility. On this densely populated continent, every nuclear power plant has consequences for neighbouring countries. It is for this reason, Mr Oettinger, that you have particular responsibility for ensuring that we get to grips with this topic, especially in the light of what has happened in Fukushima. Later on we are going to talk with you about the stress tests, in other words the safety analyses for the 143 nuclear power plants. I would encourage you to stick to your principles. We want the highest possible safety standard in Europe, not just investigations into natural disasters. Accordingly we must also investigate other risks, such as plane crashes, terrorist attacks, computer attacks, in other words this combination of attacks on nuclear power plants; what is more, you must guarantee that this does not become simply a token gesture. There is still a great deal to be done in Chernobyl. The sarcophagus is not yet safe, which is why new financial resources are required to put this in order. I have not yet heard any plans for what to do with the nuclear waste lying about the site; the disposal of this material is not yet assured. Accordingly I believe, Mr Reul, that research studies are necessary because we do not have enough experience with the long-term effects of radiation. I would encourage the Commission to put such studies in motion. In the final analysis, the safest option is the nuclear exit strategy. As we continue to cooperate with the affected countries, my greatest wish is that we should establish workshops for future technology there, and provide advice on how to save energy and develop alternative energy sources. This is precisely what is needed 25 years after Chernobyl. (The speaker agrees to take a question in accordance with Rule 149(8) of the Rules of Procedure.) Jo Leinen  (S&amp;D
). 
 – (DE)
 Mr President, I would like to thank Mr Rübig for his question. The aim must be to establish a European competence for monitoring nuclear power stations. If an issue has an impact that goes beyond national borders, then this involves a European dimension, which also requires a European competence. Mr Oettinger, we do not yet have this competence, however you must do all you can to ensure that we are given the basis to monitor nuclear plants independently and objectively from a European perspective, enabling us to draw our own conclusions when weaknesses are pinpointed. If the stress test shows that a power plant is unsafe, then it must be shut down or, if possible, upgraded. Jo Leinen  (S&amp;D
). 
 – (DE)
 Mr President, you have heard what the Chair of the Committee on Industry, Research and Energy has said. Now I am speaking as Chair of the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Food Safety and the differences could not be greater. The fact that we need the highest safety levels for all nuclear power plants goes without saying. We all agree on that. Mr Oettinger, your stress test is an important first step, but it does not go nearly far enough. I also believe that we need to rethink our approach and come up with a new one which goes into greater depth and is far more fundamental. This is why, in addition to the highest safety standards in the EU, we also need an exit scenario from a risky technology, which we cannot justify using on the densely populated continent of Europe. Mr Reul, you and others will simply have to go along with this. Your colleagues in Berlin have made much more progress than you have here in Strasbourg and in Brussels. They have probably reached the turning point, while you are still stuck with your old ideas. I hope that we can come up with a formulation, a scenario and a strategy for exiting from nuclear power. Mr Oettinger, the road map which you are producing in June of this year would be a wonderful opportunity to achieve this. After the stress tests, you must also give us your idea of how we can get out of nuclear technology. (Applause) Jo Leinen  (S&amp;D

 Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, the Treaty of Lisbon, on which work went on for so long, had two clear messages: firstly, the strengthening of the Community method with a central role for the Commission and, secondly, the strengthening of democracy with the participation of the European Parliament. Little more than a year after the entry into force of the Treaty, the spirit of Lisbon is already being ignored and ridden roughshod over. What the European Council has devised with this revision of the Treaty is unequivocally contrary to both of these messages of the Treaty of Lisbon. The Community method is not being strengthened – instead, what we have is renationalisation, intergovernmentalisation, in an important area of future EU policy and the complete exclusion of the bodies of the EU. That is unacceptable and Parliament actually has to be opposed to this proposal. It amazes me that the Commission, as guardian of the Treaties, has not spoken up more clearly and that we here in Parliament have to act, to some extent, as representatives of the Commission. We must push the Commission into action that it should already have taken. A dangerous precedent is being set here. We are observing as a result of the economic crisis that monetary union cannot exist alone. Given the influx of refugees from North Africa and the uncertainty in our neighbourhood, we are seeking additional EU policies and we do not want renationalisation. I hope that the rapporteurs can still make improvements as otherwise, I cannot vote in favour of this revision of the Treaty. Jo Leinen  (S&amp;D
).

 Mr President, the first energy summit in the history of the European Union will take place on Friday, because, with the entry into force of the Treaty of Lisbon, the Union has direct responsibilities in this sector for the first time. I agree with Mr Barroso that energy policy may be the European Union’s next big integration project. There are very many aspects to this, and President Buzek has always said that we need an energy community in the EU. Where this summit was concerned, there were many hopes and expectations that the European Union’s strategic questions with regard to energy supply would be answered. What are the strategic questions? Yes, Mr Saryusz-Wolski, they include the EU’s dependence on energy imports. They include the enormous amount of energy that is still being wasted, and there are also the negative consequences of the current energy system on ecosystems and in particular on the Earth’s atmosphere. When I look at the Council conclusions, I have to say that this energy summit is going to be a huge disappointment, because it will not answer any of these major questions. It has actually been poorly prepared in terms of the common vision that we need and it has also been poorly prepared in terms of the coherence of the resources and instruments that we use. I would like mention once again that yesterday, at the alternative energy summit of the Group of the Progressive Alliance of Socialists and Democrats in the European Parliament, a five pillar concept was proposed for how we can answer these strategic questions, how we can reduce energy imports and energy wastage and, of course, how we can eliminate the negative impact on the environment. The proposed means for achieving this were through the development of renewable energies, through energy efficiency and through the use of information technology to interlink these different energy sources. That is an innovation summit. I have not heard of information technology being used as a strategic factor before. I therefore believe that we need a technological revolution, and this summit ought to be setting us on the right course. However, I have the impression that it is going in the wrong direction. Jo Leinen  (S&amp;D

Madam President, I am pleased to be able to speak after my successor on the Committee on Constitutional Affairs, because I supported this project for 10 years and the European citizens’ initiative was included in the text of the treaty almost at the last second. Back then, it was the Members of this Parliament and of the national parliaments who took the initiative in the Convention. This opens a new chapter in the relationships between the citizens and the European institutions. All of us hope that this will reduce the distance between people and politics in Europe. The citizens’ initiative is not the cure for all our ills, but it can be a huge help. Above all, I would like to see more openness in Europe, in the form of a cross-border debate on current issues which are of interest to citizens. In my area, the environment, I can think of a number of subjects which could be put on the European Union’s agenda using this instrument and, in particular, on the agenda of the Commission in its role as European government or executive. I would also like to ask the Commission how it is preparing for these future initiatives. We must not disappoint the people. I would like to thank everyone and especially the rapporteurs Mrs Gurmai and Mr Lamassoure for their excellent work. Jo Leinen,

 Mr President, we would like to thank the Commission and the Council, Mrs Hedegaard and Mrs Schauvliege, for the daily briefings that the European Parliament delegation received in Cancún. We can truly say that, in Cancún, the EU was not part of the problem but, in many cases, was part of the solution. That should please all of us. The positive mood must now be utilised to bring new momentum to climate policy in Europe and also to the European Union. I would just like to mention three points. It was absolutely right for Parliament, in its resolution, to call for us to raise our ambitions and achieve a reduction in CO2
 of 30% by 2020, and I hope that the Commission and the Council will adopt decisions on this in the spring. Secondly, we have the Green Climate Fund. We proposed the introduction of a financial transaction tax to finance this. The people who rejected this must now come up with alternatives – we can no longer beat about the bush. Thirdly, we must do our homework. We must take the hot air out of the EU’s carbon footprint. My final point is this: This climate conference is done. Now let us look to the next one. The work must now be stepped up. Jo Leinen  (S&amp;D
). 
 – (DE) 
Mr President, Mrs Schauvliege, Commissioner, I am concerned that we are going from one extreme to the other. Prior to Copenhagen we were perhaps too ambitious, and now, ahead of Cancún, I am concerned that we are not being ambitious enough. I therefore think it is good that, in its resolution, Parliament addresses all the issues that we believe to be necessary for there to be progress and for us to achieve results even in Cancún. We have one major demand, and that is that the EU switch its strategy. Prior to Copenhagen, we made ourselves dependent on what was done in the United States and perhaps on what was done in China. That did not work there and it will not work in Cancún either. We should therefore take climate protection measures to protect our own interests. Hence the call by the majority in committee, and I hope in plenary tomorrow too, for us to increase our targets from 20% to 30%. That will be necessary during the course of the process in any case. We need to achieve this target at least before we go to South Africa. I also think that we are still on the wrong track with regard to Kyoto. Here too, we are relying on everyone else. I believe that our offer should be to establish Kyoto II. We will have no problem doing this; we will achieve it. Finally, with regard to the EU speaking with one voice: I saw how this worked in Nagoya. We had one microphone for the EU. Different people could speak, but they had to convey the same message. That is what I would like to see from the Council and the Commission in Cancún, too. Jo Leinen,  
on behalf of the S&amp;D Group.
 – (DE) 
Madam President, I hope that our Commissioner gets his voice back again, because we need a voice at the climate conference in Cancún. I had been rather surprised that Mrs Damanaki was speaking here on the revision of the hazardous substances directive after also speaking on the fisheries revisions; thank you for stepping into the breach. Parliament has not got everything that it wanted. Annex 3 has been dropped, which we regret. However, we will continue to keep an eye on these substances and when the revision takes place in three years’ time, you will have to come back to this House with your impact assessments and provide evidence of the problems that exist there on a substance-by-substance basis. We also have a considerable number of exemptions, so that it rather resembles a Swiss cheese. We also need to check here the gaps and shortcomings that exist as regards human health and the environment. I will simply say that solar panels were highly controversial. We want to keep cadmium out of the environment, but these panels put 100 000 tonnes of cadmium into the environment. That is something we will have to watch carefully. I am pleased that the Commission has made some concessions with its four statements, so for now, we will take what progress has been made in 2010 and we will meet again in three years’ time for the revision. Naturally, I would also like to thank the rapporteurs and shadow rapporteurs. Jo Leinen,

 Madam President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, the Gulf of Mexico has probably suffered one of the biggest environmental disasters of recent years, and we in Europe – in the European Union – must do everything we can to ensure that such a disaster cannot happen here. I believe we are in agreement on that. We have four seas adjoining the EU or situated within the EU: the North Sea, the Baltic Sea, the Mediterranean and the Black Sea. Oil drilling takes place in these European waters. In this regard, the subject is also an issue for the European Union. Deep-sea drilling especially represents a particular risk. That has become evident from the oil well in the Gulf of Mexico. There are problems here that are beyond our control. A great many outstanding questions have arisen to which we still do not have answers. Ladies and gentlemen, Commissioner, that is why we are recommending to you in our resolution that it would be appropriate to have a moratorium at least on new applications for deep-sea drilling until such time as we have a complete overview of what is needed and how we can close the gaps and remedy the shortcomings. I believe that the citizens of Europe expect us to ensure an equally high level of security for all 27 Member States, and thus for all four seas of the EU, and that there is no gap between countries that are already doing a lot – and that should be recognised – and those that are perhaps somewhat more lax in this area. I am also addressing our neighbouring countries here. We have a Neighbourhood Policy, and in the Mediterranean, in particular, there are, of course, also drillings by countries that are not members of the European Union. Commissioner Oettinger, I believe you are taking initiatives – and that is something you must indeed do – to talk to Libya in particular, but also to others, concerning our standards and our approaches. The question is: would the EU be prepared for such a disaster? What control mechanisms and intervention mechanisms do we have in the event of such a disaster? We need answers to this too. We have the agency in Lisbon, the European Maritime Safety Agency (EMSA), which was established in the aftermath of a disaster involving the break-up of supertankers. The agency thus checks the safety of vessels, but not the safety of the seas – in other words, precisely what we have now seen in respect of deep-sea drilling. In our opinion, it would be a good idea to expand EMSA’s mandate to allow these things also to come within its remit. That would at least address the problem adequately. I imagine that new resources would be needed for this. That is always a problem, of course. However, if we want to deal with such a major issue, then the resources will have to be found. I would also like to mention liability for such major events. What, in fact, is the insurance situation? What possibilities are there for getting the funds needed? We need to gain an overview of liability and insurance law relating to deep-sea drilling, and that is something we are discussing. Naturally we also, and above all, need to see how this applies to small companies operating in this field. Not all the companies active in this area are multinationals; there are many small companies too. How will they manage? How can they insure themselves? Do we need solidarity funds? Do we need collective solutions to ensure that those who suffer are compensated – the fishermen and others who are affected by such disasters? We also want to know whether the Environmental Impact Assessment Directive, which demands environmental impact assessments for activities on land, also applies to deep-sea drilling and related areas. There is much we do not know about the high seas. What kind of working conditions and social standards are effective there? After all, the human factor can also play a major role. We have good technology, but if the human factor fails, then it could result in such disasters. Commissioner, you have overall responsibility for energy. Offshore oil has its problems; offshore wind would be better. I believe that this debate naturally opens the way for a different energy policy in the EU – and that also lies within your remit.

 Mr President, Mr Tajani, ladies and gentlemen, along with industrial chemicals and agricultural chemicals, household chemicals represent the third large group of substances which are of significance for the environment and human health, and we are introducing rules covering these products in the biocide regulation. I believe that we have made significant progress since the old directive which dates back to 1998. Other speakers have already mentioned this. We are introducing a comprehensive regulation which applies not only to products manufactured in the EU, but also to imported products. This is very important. We are improving the labelling of these substances and, as Mr Jørgensen has said, we are calling for animal testing of these products to be replaced with alternative methods. We want to see animal tests reduced to a minimum or even abolished altogether in this area. In addition, we want particularly hazardous substances to be replaced with substances which are less dangerous. All of these measures represent progress and we can explain to the citizens of Europe that they will benefit human health and the environment. I was surprised about the level of disagreement as to whether or not the European Chemicals Agency (ECHA) in Helsinki should be responsible for monitoring and authorising these products. We want the same standards to apply throughout Europe and we want it to be possible for these products to be sold on the European market. For this reason, it is right that the ECHA takes responsibility for this area. I would like to ask Mr Tajani whether the ECHA has sufficient funding and the right organisation to be able to take on this task. My thanks go to Mrs Klaß and to the shadow rapporteurs for achieving a consensus on this subject. Jo Leinen,

 Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, I am not going to point the finger at any particular country, but I believe the finger is pointing back at all of us, because the EU strategy for 2010 has not worked and we need to think of new approaches for the new decade leading up to 2020. In a few weeks, the UN Conference of the Parties to the Convention on Biological Diversity will take place in Nagoya, and I hope that it will not be a similar disappointment to the UN Climate Change Conference in Copenhagen. At such an important global nature conservation conference, there simply must not be another failure, and the EU must play a major role in ensuring that is the case. We need to push for an ambitious global programme for the preservation of biodiversity. We must show solidarity in the financing of these measures, and the EU must speak with one voice and not 27 different ones. The Economics of Ecosystems and Biodiversity (TEEB) study has been mentioned. EUR 50 billion is lost each year as a result of species decline. In this case, 0.2% of financial resources from the EU budget for nature conservation is very meagre and paltry. In the medium-term financial programme, we simply must be provided with more money for the conservation of species. As far as the solidarity of the EU with the rest of the world is concerned, we also need an instrument that we can use to provide something in return for the species that we remove, particularly for medicinal plants. Developing countries need compensation. I also believe that the key to success lies in viewing biodiversity as a cross-cutting task. Agriculture, forestry, fisheries, marine exploitation – these now all need to be viewed from a species perspective. A soil protection directive will also gain a new importance. The soil is a buffer for CO2
, and changes to the soil represent a very negative scenario. Parliament will stand up for biodiversity. Congratulations to the rapporteur. Jo Leinen,  
on behalf of the S&amp;D Group.

Madam President, this disaster happened off the coast of the US, not the EU. It therefore affords us a real opportunity to learn some lessons and draw some conclusions. Mr Oettinger said that this is the second time we have discussed this issue. My committee has also held a major debate, and I am thankful to you that as soon as next week, together with the coordinators of the Committee on Industry, Research and Energy and the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Food Safety, we shall learn the results of your analysis, enabling us to continue our work into the summer recess. I would support you on the imposition of a moratorium on extreme drilling in Europe. We need to wait until we have identified the problems. I would also support your call for European standardisation, stringent safety standards and a European supervisory authority. As you have said, what we need is a system for auditing the auditors. I like this idea a lot. We would be happy to work on this. Mrs Damanaki, I liked what I heard from you: this disaster must spur us to change. The integrated maritime policy you have called for is a major project for the EU. I believe that harnessing the renewable energy of the sea, whether through deep-sea currents or other forms of retrieval that are yet to be invented, is a really key issue. I believe that the institutions, including the Council, have demonstrated a determination to prevent such a disaster in Europe, as has Parliament, and will be happy to cooperate with you in avoiding such an eventuality. Jo Leinen  (S&amp;D

 Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, a similar picture seems to be emerging from within all the groups. We had an interesting debate too on this regulation, which was also filled with controversy. However, the large majority of us feel that we will vote tomorrow with the rapporteur and give a clear signal to the Commission and Council. Commissioner, I believe that you said that we have a consensus. With novel foods, we need prior authorisation before they enter the market. I also explicitly agree that we need a central authorisation procedure and not different authorisation procedures in 27 Member States. This would not conform to the concept of the internal market and the uniformity of health and living conditions. We have new technologies entering the food market – as has already been mentioned in this Chamber – such as nanotechnology and GMOs. We are adopting a cautious approach in this House until we know all the facts and can be sure that our citizens can buy food which is totally safe in our supermarkets and then eat it afterwards. We are not calling for a ban on GMOs and nanomaterials. We want consumers to be given the freedom of choice or, in other words, a label indicating if these materials are contained in the food. I hope that during its cross-section debate on nanomaterials next week, the Commission will also reach a definition and perhaps a regulation so that we can have more material available about how we should handle nanomaterials. A great deal has already been said about meat from cloned animals. I would like you, Commissioner, to remove this section from the novel foods regulation. This would pave the way for a regulation on all the other topics which are not controversial. However, I would still call for a decision to be made about a separate regulation for meat from cloned animals before the conciliation procedure has ended, and to remove this from the novel foods regulation.

 Mr President, Commissioner Potočnik has thanked this Parliament emphatically for the fact that we have stayed so hard-headed with this legislative package, and that we have contributed to the big push forward that will now take place on the prevention of air pollution. The thanks for this must, of course, go to our rapporteur, Mr Krahmer, for his excellent work, but also to all the shadow rapporteurs and the others who stayed with us on this objective to make Europe’s air cleaner. The European Environment Agency has given us a report which shows that in some areas, we still have a bad situation as regards air pollution, nitrogen oxides and dust. Commissioner, you said it yourself. Now we hope that, with this new amendment, you will also have a tool for carrying out controls. We hope that you will also really implement this in a hard-headed manner and not accept any major exemptions or time wasting. After all, the previous directive dates from 1996 – that is, 14 years ago! I can understand the new Member States such as Poland and others, but I cannot understand the old Member States at all – the fact that in all these years, so little has been done, and the arguments that we hear again in this instance too, with regard to jobs and costs. Well, of course, these things always turn out badly; if we wait too long, then everything comes at once. If we do our work on time, then we can also carry out innovations and still protect jobs. Thus we have a great success, though it is spoiled somewhat by the large combustion plants. The small fry are arrested, while the big fish are allowed to go free. What happens so often in life is also unfortunately happening here with industrial plants. Jo Leinen,  
rapporteur for the opinion of the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Food Safety.

 Mr President, Mr Kallas, ladies and gentlemen, transport policy is of great importance when it comes to protecting both the environment and people’s health. It is good that the European Union has a strategy covering the period up to 2020 in order to resolve the many problems in current transport systems. We need to see a significant reduction in the environmental impact of road transport. We need genuine innovations in this area to reduce CO2
 emissions and also nitrogen oxides and fine particulates. In addition, we must integrate air and sea transport more closely into our environmental strategy. In particular, in the case of sea transport, sulphur and nitrogen oxide emissions are rising, and improvements are needed in this area. The increase in the noise produced by transport is also a nuisance for millions of people, which impacts on their quality of life. Improvements must be made in road transport, but also in rail and air transport. I would like to mention the internalisation of external costs. Company cars bring tax benefits and the airline industry does not pay excise duty on fuel, which means that we still have a great deal to do in this area. I would like to congratulate Mr Grosch on his excellent report. Jo Leinen,

 Madam President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, our group welcomes the statement by the Commission that we will fight to maintain the moratorium on commercial whaling. Now it is up to the Council to confirm this statement and, above all, to ensure that the 27 Member States speak with one voice. We cannot afford to delay this. We know from the meeting of the environment ministers that we do not have agreement here. There are some individual Member States that are pursuing different interests to the vast majority. Now that we have the Treaty of Lisbon, we ought to get used to the fact that we also speak with one voice in our foreign policy and in the representation of our values and interests in international organisations and not, as was the case in the past, each Member State for itself, which ultimately resulted in the weakening of Europe. We have seen this already at the CITES Conference. Here, our lack of agreement was ultimately a kind of powerlessness. We did not achieve what we wanted. I would not like this to continue in the International Whaling Commission. 2010 is the International Year of Biodiversity; in other words, the protection of ecosystems and threatened animal and plant species will be right at the centre of our efforts during these months. It would be a very bad sign if, in the Whaling Commission of all places, the moratorium was lifted and commercial whaling was permitted once again. We know that this animal species remains vulnerable. Our seas are becoming increasingly polluted and climate change will place yet another new strain on them. We therefore need to be very careful in our approach to this subject. The commercial interests of Japan, Iceland and Norway cannot take precedence here. Protection of this species and its ecosystems must determine our path. We are seeing the abuse of the concept of ‘scientific hunting’. Japan is clearly killing 900 whales a year in the Antarctic Ocean under the concept of ‘scientific whaling’. That is blatant abuse and I fully support the concerns of the Australian Government, which also no longer wants to permit this. We should do what the Commission has proposed in this regard. We call on the Council to create unity here so that we will speak with one voice at the forthcoming meeting of the International Whaling Commission. Jo Leinen,

 Mr President, we do not need to take a detour with regard to this vote. We can decide directly. The Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Food Safety has recommended that plenary bans the sticking together of separate pieces of meat and therefore does not allow thrombin to be used as an additive. A steak must be a steak and a ham must be a ham. I am sure that this is what the constituents of all the Members of this House want. Therefore, please vote in favour of our amendment not to include thrombin as an additive in our food regulation. Jo Leinen  (S&amp;D

 Mr President, the theme of the Lisbon Strategy was competitiveness and it was a very strongly one-sided economic strategy, which, of course, in part has failed. I am therefore very pleased that the theme of the EU 2020 strategy is now sustainability. That is the right way to go and it also involves a better balance between economic, social and environmental developments and needs. The disadvantage of sustainability is that it is a very general concept that can also lack substance. We therefore need to make it more specific. In this regard, the Commission’s paper is much too vague, as there are too many pieces of the picture missing to allow us to implement it. A resource-efficient Europe is the right approach – we have meagre energy reserves and meagre raw material reserves – but there is a lack of targets and instruments to bring us to this point of resource efficiency in our production and in our consumption. In this regard, I hope that by June we will have something rather more tangible and that we will know precisely what each of us has to do – what the Commission will do, what Parliament will do and what the Member States will have to do. In relation to this resource-efficient Europe, the environment seems to have been somewhat forgotten, because air, water, land and also ecosystems are resources too. That has been completely lost. I would therefore like to hear more from the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Food Safety in respect of what we want to do in this regard. The biodiversity strategy has failed. A new one has, of course, been drawn up to take us to 2020 and this point must be taken into account in this strategy. Climate protection has certainly been tossed about many times. I believe that we need to increase our reduction target from 20% to 30% and we need mandatory targets for energy efficiency. This is still too vague – we need to make it legally binding.

 Mr President, as if we had been able to predict what was going to happen, the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Food Safety, which is also responsible for civil protection, has an own-initiative report on the community approach to the prevention of natural disasters in the pipeline. The rapporteur is Mr Ferreira. We will be voting on this report in the next session and we will discuss our experience of the volcanic ash cloud then. Plenary will very soon be able to formulate Parliament’s position on these subjects. I agree with the Members who have said that we are poorly prepared for natural disasters. Fortunately, Europe has few natural disasters. However, we also have little experience in this area and it is clear that our crisis management is poor. In my opinion, it all took too long. Five days before a test flight took place and real data was collected is simply too long. We must learn from this. I do not want to make any accusations, but experience shows that we must do things better the next time around. If this volcanic ash has made one thing clear, it is the need for more Europe. Mr Kallas, you have said that the national authorities have responsibilities. However, this does not help the people who have suffered as a result. We need more Europe in civil protection and in a common transport policy. The Treaty of Lisbon opens up more opportunities for us. In the same way as Mrs Hübner, I would like to ask you how you will make use of the opportunities afforded by the Treaty of Lisbon in crisis management and civil protection. This situation must improve. Jo Leinen,  
rapporteur for the opinion of the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Food Safety.

 Madam President, Commissioner, the European Parliament has been waiting for this moment for a long time, namely for Parliament to be on an equal footing with the Council with respect to the control of legislative delegation. To illustrate this point: in 2008, there were 6 000 delegated acts, in other words, a huge mountain of standards, which were turned into a kind of secondary legislation by the Commission and the old comitology procedure. Parliament had very few rights in this process. We were informed, but we were not colegislators. The Treaty of Lisbon has now changed that. With regard to the control of delegated acts, we are on an equal footing with the Council, and we also want to utilise our equal standing to the full. That means, Commissioner, that when you argue that the urgency procedure is possible, then we will also need to receive information at as early a stage as possible. We want to receive information as early as the Council receives it. Jo Leinen  (S&amp;D

 Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, the Greek crisis is a current problem, while the growth crisis and the environmental crisis are long-term problems, and both need to be tackled dynamically with decisions taken by the European Council. The Europe 2020 strategy rightly states that growth should be intelligent, sustainable and inclusive. When I look at the Council’s conclusions, however, I see that they are much more narrowly focused and reduced to the classical growth strategy – a strategy that has failed and that did not get us very far. Growth cannot be intelligent if it is not sustainable and it is also not intelligent if it is not inclusive. That is why I would like to ask the Council and the Presidency of the Council to ensure that this triad, these three pillars, are retained. This is the new development that really should be implemented now. I am very pleased that growth that saves on resources and on energy is to be a flagship of the European Union. Of course, we have been talking about this for a long time. This will actually help us to save costs, reduce dependencies and solve a series of problems. I expect the Commission to provide us with a roadmap in the course of 2010, as it is a shared responsibility of the EU itself but also of the Member States, and many areas are therefore on very soft ground and very vague. Above all, we must make the target of 20% energy savings binding. This efficiency target must thus be made legally binding so that everyone knows where things are headed and industry can also realise the relevant investment. Jo Leinen  (S&amp;D
).

 A very warm welcome to Parliament, Commissioner. I wrote a letter to the President of Parliament to inform him that all of the delegations in this House have climate protection on the agenda in our discussions with our partners throughout the world. We need to find another mechanism to enable this information and these results to be linked in with your travels around the world so that those of us here in Brussels and Strasbourg know exactly where we stand. I am rather concerned that the climate negotiations could suffer the same fate as the Doha negotiations, which are constantly being postponed year after year. My question is, therefore, what is your plan B in order, perhaps, to achieve results in parts of some sectors? I also have a question concerning the Kyoto Protocol. One strategic error we made in Bangkok was to give the impression that we would abandon it. What would happen if we do not adopt something until 2011 or 2012? What is the future for the Kyoto Protocol? Jo Leinen  (S&amp;D

Mr President, Commissioner, welcome to Parliament. I would like to join my fellow Member, Mr Schnellhardt, by saying you have a major task in this area, to create genuinely equal conditions in the 27 Member States by 2010 so that household pets can be transported and brought from one country to another without obstacles. Free movement for dogs and cats was certainly the goal of the 2003 regulation. Now, for the third time, we are making an exception. In the EU, some things take a really long time: ten years to tune such regulations. No country in the EU wants diseases to be introduced and I also wonder why 22 countries accept the idea of dogs and cats being allowed to travel with their owners and five countries do not. You should examine whether the reality and the obstacles still correspond to these special provisions. I know that there are thorny debates at national level, but we are now one legal space and it is time, by 2011 at the latest, to introduce free movement, the single market for pets. The animal expert, Mr Schnellhardt, has already mentioned the conditions, namely that there is a vaccination card and that instruments like electronic tagging will be used, which will then give you access to the five countries when you are on holiday or travelling to work and wish to take your pets with you. This regulation on pets will go down in history. It is, in fact, the first legal act since the Treaty of Lisbon and we wanted a level playing field with the Council of Ministers in the empowerment of the Commission for delegated acts. That was an uphill struggle, but it was worth it. My congratulations to Mrs De Brún for this report and, of course, for this procedure to begin a new era. That is why it is so important, because we have perhaps a hundred legal acts in a year, but 6 000 delegated acts, and from this we can gauge how important it is to set the new procedure on the right track from the beginning.

 Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, following the disappointing conclusion to the climate conference in Copenhagen, Parliament is using this resolution to make it clear that there is no alternative to climate protection and that, as we move towards the next conference in Mexico, we must increase rather than decrease our efforts in this area. I shall be brief. Amendment 6 from the Group of the Progressive Alliance of Socialists and Democrats in the European Parliament was intended to serve this purpose. However, as it has been worded confusingly, we are withdrawing it. Nevertheless, we do support Amendments 1 and 9 from the Group of the Alliance of Liberals and Democrats for Europe and the Group of the Greens/European Free Alliance, which call on the EU to do more en route to Mexico. Climate protection must not come to a standstill. I would ask for your support. Jo Leinen,

Madam President, Madam President-in-Office of the Council, Mr Samecki, 2010 is the International Year of Biodiversity and the EU is about to press ahead with a new strategy for biodiversity, in other words, for the protection of flora and fauna within the area of the European Union. It would greatly enhance the credibility of the European Union if we were also to work on an international level to protect endangered flora and fauna globally and to give this our support. There will be an opportunity for this next month at the 15th Conference of the Parties to the Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species of Wild Fauna and Flora (CITES) in Doha. The EU must make itself a champion for all species which, as a result of various different factors, but in particular, over-exploitation or destructive and illegal practices, are endangered or even threatened with extinction. The Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Food Safety has debated this issue in detail and will table a proposal for a recommendation in plenary tomorrow, and we would be very pleased if the Council and the Commission were able to endorse these recommendations. Due to the time constraints, I will just mention a few example species which, in our opinion, are in need of a high or an even higher level of protection. Firstly, there is the African Elephant. We are most definitely opposed to the downlisting of this animal from Appendix I to Appendix II. The prohibition of international trade, particularly in ivory, must remain in place. Secondly, there is the Asian tiger. It is now on the brink of extinction, and we are demanding stricter protection regulations for many parties to the Convention, in particular to prevent the illegal trade in the body parts and derivatives of the tiger. We know that there is a large market for tiger bones and components of the tiger in Asia and this is threatening the existence of this animal. Thirdly, there is the protection of the polar bear. Climate change is threatening to destroy the habitat of this species and there is also an increase in trade in the body parts of polar bears. We are therefore in favour of uplisting the polar bear from Appendix II to Appendix I. I would also like to mention the protection of various species of shark. Various shark species are being over-fished, in particular the porbeagle and the spiny dogfish, but other shark species are also affected by this. Up to this point, there is consensus among us. I now come to the controversial issue. The source of the controversy is the classification of the Atlantic bluefin tuna, which is found in the Mediterranean and the Atlantic. Ladies and gentlemen, we are aware of the recommendations of the ad-hoc working group of the FAO, which wants to leave the Atlantic bluefin tuna in Appendix II. However, we are also aware of the proposal by the CITES scientific committee, which wants to uplist the Atlantic bluefin tuna to Appendix I. The background to this proposal is the data which reveals what is happening with this species. The stocks of Atlantic bluefin tuna declined by 75% between 1957 and 2007, and in the last ten years alone, there has been a decline of 60.9%. The risk to this fish is increasing and gaining momentum and therefore, the vast majority of us in the committee were of the opinion that this species should be included in Appendix I. This means that there will only be restrictions and prohibitions on international fishing fleets, not local fishing. Thus, the small, local fishermen can continue to catch this fish, and the preservation of the fish in the ecosystem is, in any case, more important than the general availability of sushi and sashimi. That is the conflict that we face. We need to take a long-term view and should provide proper protection for the Atlantic bluefin tuna in Appendix I. Jo Leinen  (S&amp;D

 Mr President, Mrs Espinosa, last week I attended the Informal Environment Council meeting in Seville. It was the first Council configuration under the Spanish Presidency. You were, of course, unable to attend due to an unfortunate family matter, but your Secretary of State, Teresa Ribera, did a splendid job of representing you. Throughout the meeting, which was extremely well organised, the commitment of the Spanish Presidency to the matter was evident. That is all well and good, but the result of this Council meeting was not very satisfactory. The Council of Ministers was divided, with a complete lack of direction. There is absolutely no agreement among Member States about what we should do now. That is not a good sign. It is your job and your responsibility to find the common denominator among the 27 Member States. In my opinion, we need to do three things in the European Union following Copenhagen. The first is that we must regain the leading role in global climate protection. Secondly, we need to show credibility in the commitments that we have made and, thirdly, we urgently need to gain new partners before we get to Mexico. With regard to regaining the leading role, I agree with everyone here who said that we should continue to state our promise to reduce carbon emissions by 30%. I would like to see us specify this 30% target to the UN Secretariat in Bonn on 31 January, not the old 20% target. If we make ourselves dependent on comparable efforts by others, it will take forever and Mexico will also come to nothing. In terms of showing credibility, the EUR 7.2 billion must actually be realised before Mexico. The countries in Africa need to be able to see that the first measures are already in progress. Finally, with regard to gaining partners, I hope that we will develop climate protection diplomacy and, with the help of the African Union in particular, that we will also find sufficient partners, including in Latin America and Asia, for a global agreement in Mexico.

 Mr President, an official delegation is representing Parliament in Copenhagen. You will also be attending and, for the first time, we do not have to rent an office in the city. Instead, we will have an official presence in the EU pavilion. This is good and we are grateful. Therefore, Article 61 is not needed. The Treaty of Lisbon ensures not only that Parliament will be listened to with regard to international treaties, but also that it has to agree to them. This is the beginning of a new era for us and, therefore, we are asking, in accordance with Article 60, to be admitted to the EU coordination meetings and not to be left standing outside the door. The Commission must treat us in the same way as it does the Council when it provides information about treaty negotiations and we are asking it to begin with the Kyoto agreement. This is our request to the Commission. Perhaps Mrs Reding would like to say something on this subject. (Applause) Jo Leinen,

 Mr President, Mr President-in-Office of the Council, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, in recent years, the European Parliament has been a driving force in the debate on climate protection, and we have also achieved a large percentage of the EU’s climate protection package. The resolution that we are putting forward today has all the elements for an ambitious agreement in Copenhagen. Yet what we are proposing is also realistic. It is both ambitious and realistic at the same time, and we hope that the Council and the Commission will join forces with us to form a single lobbying body at the conference in order to get other partners on board. The EU has taken on the leadership role in these issues and we want that to remain the case in Copenhagen. We must therefore stand by our offer of a 30% reduction in CO2
 by 2020. The science tells us that we need to be in the upper end between 25% and 40%. 30% would therefore still not be enough, we know that, and that is why we must actually offer this target, as it will drive up the ambition of other countries. We know that global climate protection is not possible without financing. In contrast to the Council, Parliament has given specific figures in this regard. The global framework is around EUR 100 billion, and Europe needs to take on around a third of that. So why do we not say that we will provide EUR 30 billion in 2020? Parliament has committed itself to this and I hope that the Council and the Commission will be equally specific in two weeks time. Mrs Wortmann-Kool has already mentioned the kick-start. We need EUR 5 to 7 billion straight away. When I look at how much money we made available for the banking crisis, we are really talking about peanuts to overcome the climate crisis – and there will be no second chance at this. Once the climate has been broken, it will be broken forever and we will not be able to fix it. This really has to deserve a major effort from us all, therefore. I also note that some countries are moving, but others are not. It must not be the case that the two greatest climate polluters, China and the United States, play a giant game of ping-pong where each accuses the other whilst dragging its own feet. That is irresponsible and I hope that the US, in particular, will also show leadership in Copenhagen, with specific information on reductions in its own climate-change gases and also a share of the financing. Without these two countries and without India, there will be no agreement. We emphasise forestry policy once again – deforestation is a major factor – as well as aviation and maritime transport. If railways are included in the emissions trading and have to pay, I can no longer see why aviation and maritime transport should have such special privileges. At long last, Parliament will be represented in the EU pavilion for the first time. That is a new beginning, and I hope we are able to take part in the briefing between the Council and the Commission since, under the Treaty of Lisbon, we have joint legislative power on the Copenhagen agreement. Jo Leinen  (S&amp;D

 Mr President, the demand from Václav Klaus for an addition to the Charter of Fundamental Rights is both arbitrary and superfluous. However, it is easy to oppose, because the charter refers only to EU law and applies only to the future. Therefore, if necessary, the Council should make a political declaration. In a few weeks, the ratification of the treaty, which we have been waiting nine years for, should then take place. The European Council must make the necessary preparations, but should not jump to any hasty conclusions. This applies also to the European External Action Service. The High Representative is responsible for proposing a concept for the service, not the Council bureaucracy. I would therefore ask the Council Presidency to ensure that the service is not in a position off to one side, but can integrate itself into the community system, as Mr Barroso has said. This treaty gives us the legal basis for a common energy policy and for a common climate protection policy. I can only hope that the fog lifts before Copenhagen, because we must not leave these questions open until the conference. The Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Food Safety has made clear demands, including with regard to financing. I hope that there will be agreement on a financing concept next week at the summit. Furthermore, we need internal burden-sharing within the EU. Germany and other countries must give way, as we need a fair deal both within the EU and between the EU and the developing countries throughout the world. Jo Leinen,

Madam President, Commissioner Olli Rehn has praised this Parliament for its activities in bringing about the climate protection package and, in fact, we aim to continue to be ambitious. Last night, the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Food Safety voted 55-1 in favour of adopting a resolution that sets high targets for the negotiations in Copenhagen. This result shows that the denial of climate change, the ignorance of these matters, is represented by a vanishingly small minority of individuals here in this House whose views really should be disregarded and who have made their views known here on a number of occasions, but who are actually swimming against the tide of opinion of the citizens of all the countries of the European Union. It makes no difference to the Earth’s atmosphere where the CO2
 comes from. That means that we need a global agreement for every country and not – as is already being argued in Bangkok – multiple agreements, with one for the US, one for Europe and one for the developing countries – that would be disastrous. We need a global pact against climate change and that means that we also need a global pact of solidarity of the rich countries with the poor ones. This point has already been made many times. Climate change represents an opportunity for us and also for the developing countries to set in motion low-carbon development with new technologies, together with the modernisation of the infrastructure. Europe must help this come about. When it comes to funding, we have endorsed the demand that the EU needs EUR 30 billion by 2020 and that we must develop funding tools that are durable and predictable. They must not simply be dependent on funds from the budget, but must also have other sources of funding. I want to stress, once again, that marine transport and aviation must be included and that, of course, the forests and agriculture have their own, significant share. Development and climate protection are not opposites – rather, they must be brought together into a synthesis in Copenhagen. Jo Leinen  (S&amp;D

 Mr President, after eight years and many debates and negotiations, there is a real chance now that this Reform Treaty will enter into force, thanks also to the hard work of many people in this House who were committed to this project from beginning to end in the Convention and later in the intergovernmental conferences. I believe that Parliament has played a constructive part in this Reform Treaty. I think that, if the constitutional court in Prague in the Czech Republic gives a positive ruling, there will no longer be any legal grounds for President Klaus to block the EU any further. The other constitutional bodies in the Czech Republic will also find ways to overcome any such illegal blockade. We are, of course, hearing that there is a new threat of trouble from the United Kingdom. However, if a British Government were to allow a referendum, then it would not be on the Treaty of Lisbon but on whether the British people are in favour of the EU or whether they want to pull out of Europe. That would have to be the subject of the referendum and not a treaty that has been ratified. That would be totally unacceptable. I think we need to learn something from this, and that is that our citizens need more information. I therefore hope that, in the new Commission, we will also get a vice-president for communication and for information and perhaps even a commissioner for European citizenship. That would be the answer to these controversies on European policy. Jutta Haug  (S&amp;D

Mr President, Commissioners, ladies and gentlemen, the extraordinary meeting of the European Council is now imminent and we are talking ourselves to a standstill in an effort to achieve harmony. The extraordinary meeting has one sole purpose: to develop the Council’s mandate for the negotiations on the multiannual financial framework. As part of the preparations, two inter-related negotiating boxes have been produced. To put it bluntly, we are not satisfied, and we cannot possibly be satisfied with what has been presented. We are also annoyed, to put it mildly, by the Council’s conduct on budgetary issues, which can be described in one word: irresponsible! We can only repeat what we said in June last year, namely that we need a proper system of own resources which is worthy of the name. The Commission has taken a first small step, but this is not enough. There is almost nothing we need more urgently than these genuine own resources, for they would mean that the European budget would no longer be dependent on national contributions. We need this independence to put an end to this untenable situation. There would also be no further logic to the arguments being advanced in some Member States. As Mr Reul has just said, the debate there is only ever about payments, contributions and spending. They never discuss political priorities, their priorities. They never tell us what they would like to achieve with the European budget. No ideas are forthcoming about the future of the European Union. The Council is not acting like a European institution. Instead, it has become a collection of 27 sets of national self-interest, where they all bicker like children  The budget is like a pie, and yes, there should be pie, but they squabble over which ingredients they should provide and how big their slice of the pie should be. Everyone wants to eat and no one wants to bake. It is appalling! Jutta Haug  (S&amp;D

Madam President, Commissioners, ladies and gentlemen, the next multiannual financial framework and the amount of funding and the policies we want to finance are the focus of our discussions and disagreements here as we seek to reach a consensus, but this is only one side of the coin, namely the expenditure side. However, we must work on the other side of the coin as well, namely the revenue side. That is nothing new. For almost 20 years, the European Parliament has been calling for a more transparent, fairer and simpler system of own resources. Now, for the first time, we can lend weight to this demand.  In the SURE report last June, we called for a system of own resources which would abolish all of the rebates and make the revenue side of the EU budget completely independent of the contributions made by Member States. The Commission took account of these demands, at least to some extent, by proposing a reform of own resources from valued added tax and the introduction of a Financial Transaction Tax. We support this proposal by the Commission, even though it only amounts to a 40 % reform. It is at least a step forward, and what is more, it moves in the right direction.  The European Union has won the Nobel Peace Prize. This was intended to be an expression of gratitude but also an incentive to go further. A more peaceful approach could also be achieved if the constant bean-counting between the net contributors and the net recipients were consigned to the past following a reform of the revenue system. A genuinely European revenue stream would also highlight the European value added of the EU budget. Then this constant small-minded national bean-counting could finally stop. Jutta Haug,

Mr President, President of the Council, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, the Committee on the Environment would like to remind you that, although it is responsible only for an infinitesimal part of the European budget, we will certainly not achieve the aims of the Europe 2020 strategy if we do not commit sufficient appropriations to the programmes and measures relating to environment and climate action and biodiversity. That is why we have reinstated the totally incomprehensible cuts the Council made to the Commission proposal. After all, the Commission did also subscribe to the commitment to sustained growth. In any case, the Commission was already being very cautious when it drew up the budget. It provided for a rise of no more than 0.72 % for climate and environment policy. In plain words, that simply means a cut. For the inflation rate is in fact 2 %. Even more dubious is what the Council is doing with the agencies. Let us make it quite clear: the Commission has already included the minus 1 % for staff in its proposal, and, moreover, it is as usual also reducing the appropriations the agencies regard as necessary. That means the available budget for the agencies is pretty low from the outset. And then the Council comes along and snips away at it even more. Soon we will be down to the bare bones! This most affects the agencies to which the legislator, i.e. the Council and the EP together, have transferred new tasks. They cannot fulfil them if they do not receive adequate funding. We expect the Commission to produce a supplementary and rectifying budget as soon as possible in any case and at all events. We expect the Council to take on board our good arguments when it negotiates with Parliament. We know that the Council is incorruptible, but surely it can at least see reason! Jutta Haug  (S&amp;D

 Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, in unity, strength. That is what they say. We ought not to be wasting our energy among ourselves, therefore, because the vast majority of us – Parliament, Council and Commission – are in agreement: Europe needs growth, and Europe needs jobs. How, then, can we put this unity of analysis into action? That is where the European budget comes into play – the common budget that is a budget for investment with no compulsion for consolidation, because it has no debts. A European budget with adequate funds, an innovative structure and the necessary flexibility is quite simply our common instrument for leveraging existing growth potential in Europe, opening up new prospects and maintaining our position in the global competition for talent, technologies and market leadership. The common European budget represents our joint European opportunity, our added value. That cannot be that hard to grasp; even the Council can do so. Jutta Haug,  
rapporteur for the opinion of the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Food Safety.

 Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, the Committee on the Environment is responsible for the budget lines for the environment, public health and food safety, and controls 0.76% of the Union’s budget. Overall, we were very pleased with the implementation rates. A full 99.26% of resources are tied up in the environment and climate change sector, while the figure in the LIFE programme, our flagship and our only financial instrument for the environment, was 99.4%. The rate was also above 99% in the health sector too. All the available information leads us to the recommendation that the Commission should be granted discharge. I have been dealing with agencies in various capacities for seven and a half years. These seven and a half years have taught me that it is the decentralised agencies that do the lion’s share of the work in Europe, fulfilling the tasks assigned to them by the legislators, Parliament and Council under the ordinary legislative procedure. For seven and a half years, I have seen how the agencies are under particularly close public scrutiny. More than ever before, the specialist committees are particularly rigorous in exercising political control over the agencies. We want to know what staff in the agencies do, how they do it, and what happens with the resources from the Community budget. The agencies’ budgets are not arbitrarily organised in the budgetary process, nor are the agencies absolved of responsibility in the discharge process. However, during these seven and a half years, I have never experienced so many half-truths, insinuations and misinformation being used to create an atmosphere of distrust and suspicion towards the agencies and the people working in them during the discharge process. This is not worthy of the working practices normally followed in this House. This fatal combination is the reason why the Committee on Budgetary Control has applied to defer the discharge for three agencies, the Medicines Agency, the Environment Agency and the Food Safety Authority. Of course, I support criticism of excessively high carry-overs to the next year and of the extremely high cost of governing body meetings. However, these issues do not justify the deferral of the discharge. Speaking from my seven and a half years of experience working with agencies, I can only recommend that our decision in relation to granting discharge should not be based on an unholy mix of half-truths, misinformation and insinuations. With all the information available to us, we can confidently grant discharge to all agencies without exception. Jutta Haug,

 Mr President, Mr Dominik, Mr Lewandowski, ladies and gentlemen, let us not be under any illusions. We are in the same position in the budget process for 2012 that we find ourselves in every year: faced by a Council that does not understand the issues. As always, the Council has cut the appropriations for the Commission, even the not very large amount for the environment and climate change, for public health and for food and feed safety. Together with the four agencies, this amounts to just under EUR 1 billion, in other words, all of 0.67% of the EU budget. Therefore, we are very pleased that the Committee on Budgets has complied with all our requests and has restored the funding from the draft budget in all cases. At this point I would like to give my warm congratulations to the rapporteur. Ms Balzani has done an excellent job. We are also pleased that the package which has been negotiated includes seven pilot projects and three preparatory actions from the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Food Safety. We have never been as successful as this in the past. All that remains now is for us all, together with the Council – and perhaps it will work – to ensure that good results for the citizens of Europe come out of the negotiations. Jutta Haug  (S&amp;D

 Madam President, Mr Barroso, Mr Dowgielewicz, the Commission’s legislative proposal has been described by Mr Barroso as ambitious, but realistic and sensible. Having listened to the dismissive and highly critical reactions from various capital cities in our wonderful European Union, it would be easy to believe this. However, if you read the proposal, which is what Parliament does, unlike many areas of government and the large majority of journalists, you get the very clear impression that the time when the Commission was regarded as the engine of European integration and development is finally over. The Commission has failed to meet Parliament’s expectations with regard to the structure of the budget, levels of spending and the extent of the reform of the own resources system. To give one example of revenues, Parliament has said that we want our budget to be based entirely on own resources as laid down in the Treaty. Therefore, we aim to replace the transfers from the Member States completely. At the same time, we want to bring an end to all rebates. What does the Commission do? It proposes replacing less than half of the Member States’ contributions with real own resources and no longer calculating the rebates, but simply applying a flat rate. Well, my goodness! It would have been better if we had at least reached this point only as the result of long negotiations between Parliament and the Council, as a compromise achieved, as far as I am concerned, with the help of the Commission. We in Parliament had hoped that the Commission, as the champion of a Europe-centric policymaking approach, would be on our side during the negotiations with the Council, but now we are anticipating the inevitable discussions with very mixed feelings. Jutta Haug  (S&amp;D

 Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, a year ago, the plenary agreed and mandated a special committee to draft the position of the European Parliament in relation to the next financial perspective. Now, following exactly eleven months of work, the Policy Changes Committee is presenting the fruits of its labours. This was a task that required discipline and concentration and that could only be achieved by adopting an approach characterised by openness, solidarity and mutual trust. For that, let me express my sincerest gratitude to those Members involved in the creative process. The report we have produced, drawn up under the leadership of Mr Garriga Polledo, is a genuinely good result. It is something of which we can be proud. However, as we all know, good results require not just hard-working Members, but also excellent staff. We certainly had this, not just in the shape of our personal assistants and our group staff, but also, above all, in an excellent secretariat. This super team, led by Monika Strasser, was not just competent and professional, but was also more than usually interested in its work. It was patient and creative, extremely well organised, and, at the same time, spontaneous and flexible. Best of all, it was always cheerful and open. They obviously enjoyed all the hard work. I would like to thank this nine-strong team from the bottom of my heart. Thank you very much indeed. (Applause)
 From the outset, Mr Garriga Polledo and I wanted to deliver a report that could be supported by three quarters of Parliament. We actually received a majority of more than four fifths in the vote in committee. We were very pleased with this. Our call for a seven-year financial perspective which is expressed in a structure that reflects the objectives of the Europe 2020 strategy, while, at the same time, respecting all the policies for the European Union and avoiding increasing the European budget to unrealistic levels, must be seen to be reasonable. It is realistic and achievable. Our report contains 174 paragraphs, all of them arguments for more Europe. We genuinely need more Europe. Please read the report. It offers the best basis for convincing our citizens in local debate and for entering into serious negotiations with the Council, which is unfortunately notable by its absence today. Thank you for your excellent work. Jutta Haug,

 Madam President, President-in-Office of the Council, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Food Safety has expressed a very positive opinion to the Committee on Budgetary Control. We were very pleased with how the funds had been implemented by the Commission services. We have no criticisms to make, either as regards the way in which the funds were spent or as regards the level of expenditure. On the contrary, we have nothing but praise for the prompt and positive use of the funds in the LIFE programme. The Commission has succeeded in spending the additional funding that we granted and in doing so usefully. The agencies in our area – the European Environment Agency (EEA), the European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control (ECDC), the European Chemicals Agency (ECA), the European Food Safety Authority (EFSA) and the European Medicines Agency (EMA) – have also managed their money responsibly. In contrast to the competent committee, the Committee on Budgetary Control criticises the European Medicines Agency in its report and even wishes to refuse discharge for this agency. I think that is going too far, to put it politely. If I were being less polite I might say that the Committee on Budgetary Control is interfering in matters outside its sphere of competence. It should please stop doing so. I can only ask Parliament and plenary to improve matters in this respect. Jutta Haug  (S&amp;D
),  
in writing. 
– Though not very ambitious, the first reading compromise improves the current legislation – I therefore voted in favour. Besides the new methodology for substance restrictions, one key improvement is the open scope: all electric and electronic equipment, including equipment for the generation of electric currents, will in the medium term fall under the RoHS legislation. A major drawback, however, is the long list of exclusions, including photovoltaic panels. Excluding this decisive ‘clean’ technology from environmental legislation will send the wrong signal, EU-wide and globally. This is about setting the right regulatory framework for coherent sustainable investments! Even if the production of photovoltaic panels with hazardous substances like cadmium telluride might be more cost-efficient, less problematic alternatives have existed for a long time and have proved to function excellently. I do not see any need, therefore, to cover our roofs and fields with potentially hazardous waste, shifting the disposal challenge to future generations. On this point, I strongly disagree with the position and decision of the EP’s and Council’s majority. Jutta Haug,  
rapporteur for the opinion of the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Food Safety.

 Mr President, Mr Wathelet, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, as rapporteur for the opinion of the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Food Safety regarding the budget, I will not be telling anyone here present anything new. Nevertheless, I would like to point out once again that the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Food Safety is responsible for less than 1% of the budget as a whole, less than 1% of all environmental protection actions, biodiversity actions and actions in the fight against climate change. It is responsible for the whole area of public health, for food and feed safety, and for veterinary measures, as well as for the extremely important work of five European agencies. 1%! Well, in that case, it is certainly not possible to talk of excessive quantities of money. This small amount of money is therefore desperately needed for carrying out our work. It will therefore be no surprise to anyone that we are unable to accept the Council’s cuts. We need the resources. Jutta Haug  (S&amp;D
). 
 – (DE) 
Mr President, Commissioner, I will say right at the outset that I think it is a good document that we have before us here. It is balanced, as Mr Lewandowski has always promised us – balanced with a large number of suggestions and ideas for how we can, and should, continue to work. However, it is not what we as budget specialists in the Committee on Budgets expected. To be honest, we thought there would be an analysis of the current financial framework, and the real optimists even believed that we might also get a small revision for the remaining period of the current financial perspective. However, what we have before us now is purely a glance into the future. Almost every other section mentions how we should do things better in future with regard to our budget, whether in relation to our priorities, how to achieve the goals of the Europe 2020 strategy, better cooperation with our neighbours, better European infrastructure or our future agricultural policy and cohesion policy. This paper even presents ideas with regard to the future structure of our budget and the length of the next financial period. (The President cut off the speaker) Jutta Haug,  
rapporteur for the opinion of the Committee on Budgets.
 – (DE)
 Mr President, Mr Wathelet, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, our two rapporteurs have already provided an evaluation of the Council’s position, and now it is my turn to speak on behalf of the Committee. I would like to say right at the start that I am certain that the Belgian Presidency will do as good a job as it possibly can. However, it can only do its job as well as it is permitted to do by the Council as a whole. Unfortunately, we have to admit that, in this regard, the result is poor. The Council has, as usual – and I cannot remember things ever being any different – gone round busily deleting and cutting parts of the Commission’s draft, in terms of both the commitments and the payments. It has done this all over the place at random – and that is also the usual procedure. It has not looked to see where this could possibly make sense and where not. The result is more than EUR 780 million less in commitments and EUR 3.6 billion less in payments. If we look at who this affects in particular, we see that once again, it is the decentralised agencies. We established these agencies together by means of legislation. Both Parliament and the Council were involved, otherwise there would be no agencies. However, if we do not make available to them the funds they need to enable them to do exactly what we have tasked them with doing, we ought to shut them down. Otherwise, every euro we give them really is money down the drain. The same thing applies to the executive agencies. The Commission has already mentioned this. If we bleed dry the executive agencies that are supposed to implement the multiannual programmes that have been decided by law, these programmes are finished. Do we really want that to happen? Elements in the Council hold pious speeches about how Europe must make greater efforts to be, or to become, competitive. In the budget procedure, however, it is precisely those parts of the budget that are intended to promote growth and competitiveness that are being cut, in other words, category Ia. The structural policy figures are being affected in a similar way. Where there are now real requirements for funds from the regions, funding is being reduced by EUR 1 billion. That can hardly be regarded as logical, and it is certainly not wise. We would really like those with the political responsibility to look closely at the content of our budget – the content! – and, in so doing, to have Europe and its added value for citizens in mind and in sight. Then they will indeed find a suitable partner for discussion in us. Jutta Haug  (S&amp;D

Madam President, it is a little unusual, but I must inform my own group that our voting list for the Trüpel report is not correct in the form that we have laid it down. There has been a misunderstanding. We reject all the amendments, except our own. Jutta Haug,  
rapporteur for the opinion of the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Food Safety. 
– (DE)
 Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I would just like to address one point, a point that really is a scandal. I am talking about the European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control, the ECDC in Stockholm. Since May 2005, highly qualified people there have had to work in an absolutely hostile environment. Until now, the Swedish Government has been unable to conclude an accord de siege
 with the ECDC, although they desperately wanted this agency, like all Member States always badly want an agency. To this day, none of the employees have a personal identity number, the so-called Folkbokföring
 number. However, this number is used by public administrations, institutions and private companies to identify their customers. Consequently, children born in Sweden cannot be registered, for example, providers of electricity, gas, telecommunications and television withhold their services, landlords refuse long-term tenancy agreements and there are problems accessing doctors and hospitals. For spouses, it means it is impossible to become self-employed in Sweden. There are also enormous difficulties in getting a job. The list could go on. One thing is clear: certain fundamental rights anchored in European law are simply being denied to the staff at the ECDC in Sweden. As a result, all of this has landed before our Committee on Petitions. In any case, the situation is untenable …. (The President cut off the speaker) Jutta Haug,  
rapporteur.

Mr President, Mr President-in-Office of the Council, Commissioner, when we debated this year’s budget in December of last year, we were already aware and, as general rapporteur for the 2009 budget, I mentioned in the discussion that the impact of the financial market crisis and its repercussions on the real economy would be felt in all the Member States. This is exactly what has happened. In April 2009, Parliament and the Council agreed on the funding for the first part of the economic stimulus proposed by the Commission. In order to make the EUR 2.6 billion available, we needed what was referred to as a minor revision of the financial perspective. How would we have been able to find the funds otherwise, given our tight budgetary constraints? The remaining EUR 2.4 billion, which was missing from the total of EUR 5 billion, was to be found this autumn. This is where we are now. Autumn is here and, because Parliament and the Council have come to a sensible arrangement on the 2010 budget, we have a solution. The 2009 budget is also making a significant contribution to this solution. The 2010 supplementary and amending budget cuts the payment appropriations by more than EUR 3.4 billion. In line with this, the margins of the unused areas under the different headings will be reduced by almost EUR 1.5 billion. All of this applies to the 2009 budget, which consists of EUR 133.8 billion in commitment appropriations and EUR 116.1 billion in payment appropriations, and is therefore not exactly on a lavish scale. If we take a look at the budget lines where the Commission found the necessary money, it becomes abundantly clear that the Commission simply does not take the budgetary authority’s resolutions seriously. I would like to remind Parliament that in 2008, when we adopted the 2009 budget, our priorities were also the competitiveness of the European Union, growth and employment. This is why we allocated more money than proposed by the Commission to budget lines which promoted the social dimension by creating more and better jobs and supporting small and medium-sized enterprises. However, it is precisely these budget lines which are being plundered for transfers or amending budgets. Would it be asking too much to call on the Commission to implement the resolutions of Parliament and the Council and to make an effort to ensure that the money reaches its intended destinations where it will have a positive impact? The draft budget submitted to us by the Commission has not been accurately calculated or carefully estimated. In 2009, we had more than 50 transfers and 10 supplementary and amending budgets. It is not possible to talk about budgetary accuracy and clarity in this context and this situation must improve. Our fellow Members in the specialist committees must pay greater attention to the implementation reports in the course of the financial year and the Commission must finally live up to the good reputation that it still has of being an effective European administrative body. I hope that we will all work towards this. Jutta Haug,  
rapporteur.

 Mr President, I would like to thank all my fellow Members. We have managed to find a common position with regard to the Council. However, I would also like to thank the Council and the Presidency of the Council very warmly at this point. Anyone who knows me will be aware that I am normally very sparing with praise and thanks. Nevertheless, I would like to express my sincere gratitude to the Swedish Presidency and, in particular, Mr Lindblad, for its work and its constant presence during the discussions on budget issues. This made a pleasant contrast to the other Council presidencies that I have experienced during the course of my long career as a Member of Parliament. Thank you very much. This morning, many Members took part in the discussion and I believe that on this occasion, there were many more Members involved than usual. The majority of them referred to the limitations of the budget and its structure. Ladies and gentlemen, we can confidently assume that the 2010 budget will be the last of its kind, the last with this structure, which leads us to believe that we can finance the necessary policies of the European Union and its new challenges and tasks in this way. We expect the new Commission to carry out the mid-term review quickly, as, under the terms of the agreements made in 2006, this should have been submitted by 2009 at the latest, in other words, by the end of this year. To spell it out, we also expect a revision proposal for the current financial perspective. We cannot wait until 2014 for reform. We need sustainable instruments now, so that the European Union can meet the challenges of the immediate future with democratic legitimacy, as the Chair of the Committee on Budgets, Mr Lamassoure, has just called for on behalf of all of us. Jutta Haug,  
draftsman of the opinion of the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Food Safety

 Ladies and gentlemen, it is no secret that the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Food Safety takes the view time and again – this year included – that the funds provided in the European budget absolutely do not suffice to provide effective environmental programmes, to maintain our biodiversity and for a fight against climate change that has a chance of succeeding. The fact that the Council makes even further cuts from these meagre funds is as incomprehensible as ever. That is why ‘back to the preliminary draft budget’ is the standard response. There are two things that we must impress on the Commission. The first of these is that we expect it to immediately include what are known as the ‘assigned revenues’ for those agencies that are partly dependent on fees – such as the European Medicines Agency in London or the European Chemicals Agency in Helsinki – in the preliminary draft budget and not to achieve an artificial margin by omitting them. The second point is that we expect the Commission to bring forward a proposal as soon as possible for how it will fund the anti-smoking campaign Help 
in future after the tobacco fund has run out. You see, it is the same every time. Jutta Steinruck  (S&amp;D
),  
in writing.
 – (DE) 
When we vote tomorrow on the own-initiative report on a Social Investment Pact, it will become apparent whether we finally have a cross-party understanding of how we need to tackle the crisis. Our collective response must be not simply cost-cutting measures, but specific measures to achieve the Europe 2020 targets. We can achieve these targets, but it will not happen by itself. If we want more jobs, we must make it possible for our economy to employ more people. Between 2008 and 2011, there was a 4 % fall in output in Europe (from 20 % to 16 %) which resulted in an 11 % fall in employment. On the one hand, that means that we have to invest in places where new jobs are needed. On the other hand, it also means that we have to pay special attention to the nature of these jobs: jobs must be sustainable and must offer decent employment conditions. The crisis must not be an excuse for low wages and social dumping! Europe’s economic policy must be expanded to include a compensatory social policy. We in particular, as the European Parliament, must resolutely uphold the interests of the individual in Europe. Accordingly, I would urge honourable Members to press energetically for European workers to be given back their right to decent employment! Jutta Steinruck  (S&amp;D
),  
in writing.
 – (DE)
 The working conditions of women in the service sector are still not how we would like them to be. A quarter of all non-typical employees work in the service sector; in the German retail trade, there are almost a million so-called ‘mini-jobs’. Working women, who represent eight out of 10 of those employed in the service sector, are particularly strongly affected by this. We have already achieved a great deal in respect of equality between men and women, and we are on the right path to achieving even more. However, in the context of services, specifically, it is particularly important that agreement is finally reached on the Posting of Workers Directive. Women are particularly strongly affected by this: 58% of all the women working in posted positions in Germany work in the service sector. The percentage of female workers in, for example, care work is considerably higher than in many other sectors, and the working conditions are often very poor. What we need are minimum wage rates, limits on working hours and safety standards that are reasonable for all female workers in Europe. We can only achieve these objectives if we lay down clear rules for the posting of workers by temporary employment agencies. I am therefore pleased to see that the rapporteur takes up the subject of mobility in her opinion. We advocate a clearly regulated legal framework for Europe’s internal market in the field of services in order to prevent precarious labour relations and discrimination. Jutta Steinruck  (S&amp;D

 As rapporteur for the Programme for Social Change and Innovation, which integrates the three programmes EURES, Progress and the European Progress Microfinance Facility, I would like to draw attention to two specific matters. The Committee on Employment and Social Affairs rejected the Commission proposal to finance the cross-border partnerships through the European Social Fund (ESF) from 2014 onwards. If the financing of these partnerships were only to be possible within the framework of the ESF, each participating Member State would have to include this in its operational programme for the ESF. In view of the many priority areas for subsidies that is unlikely to happen. Cross-border partnerships for mobility-related advice must also be financed via the EURES axis. This call is supported across the groups and across the Member States, and I am hoping for the support of the Council. It is a question of facilitating mobility and of providing the associated advice. With a broad consensus and the support of all of the groups, we have introduced a fourth axis for a Youth Initiative. This is about financing specific projects for combating youth unemployment. The Youth Initiative will only be integrated into the programme if additional financing is secured via the multiannual financial framework. The Commission and the Council are always saying that something has to be done to combat youth unemployment, but there is a lack of projects. If combating youth unemployment really is a priority for the Council then this is the opportunity to prove it. Jutta Steinruck  (S&amp;D

 Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, in view of the economic problems, the crisis and the challenges faced by European companies, their employees, creditors and other shareholders and stakeholders, EU company law needs to focus on a sustainable, forward-looking corporate model characterised by long-term thinking. I am therefore asking you to pursue the aims of a social Europe. As part of that, you need to look at the involvement of workers in corporate decisions. You should also involve the social partners in your initiatives. After all, businesses have a social responsibility towards society and in respect of their contribution to growth and employment. In all your proposals, you must ensure that, as far as possible, existing rules on codetermination cannot be bypassed or eroded. We need the highest possible standards in European companies and we need corporate decisions to involve all those affected. Jutta Steinruck  (S&amp;D
),  
in writing.
 – (DE)
 I expect the European Commission to finally learn the lessons of the crisis. There are some good ideas, but there is a lack of commitment. I welcome proposals such as support for start-ups, the overdue consultation paper on the quality framework for internships, or the youth initiative to give young people some career prospects. However, well-intentioned proposals do not reduce youth unemployment. Improving the quality of work and strong codetermination must remain key elements of European policy. I reject the idea of the uniform contract of employment, which is another attempt to erode protection from termination of employment. I also take a highly critical view of a new tripartite pay monitoring committee at European level. The EU Treaty excludes the possibility of intervening in wage setting. It must stay that way. Along with the trade unions, we in the Group of the Progressive Alliance of Socialists and Democrats in the European Parliament would warn against using the crisis to undermine the autonomy of the social partners.

 2007 was the ‘European Year of Equal Opportunities’. Five years later and Europe is still at square one. It is true that we have established the legal principle of the same remuneration for men and women. Nonetheless, wage inequality for men and women still exists. We are making little or no progress. I am pleased, therefore, that, as well as setting targets, the rapporteur has also provided some specific, detailed recommendations in her report. We need collective redress when this principle of equal pay is violated. It must be possible to obtain prosecutions for wage discrimination. We are calling for awareness campaigns dealing with wage inequality for men and women. We need wage equality officers in the various Member States. This will enable progress in the Member States to be monitored more effectively. We need to make specific progress. In this case specific progress means pursuing legal initiatives requiring equal pay for men and women. Jutta Steinruck  (S&amp;D

 Mr Clark, you and some of the previous speakers have mentioned a reduction in red tape as a cure-all to get rid of youth unemployment in Europe. I would be very interested to know, however, what exactly you mean by that, and whether you are also aware of the consequences of certain measures. Jutta Steinruck  (S&amp;D
). 
 – (DE)
 Madam President, Commissioner, many of the previous speakers have already mentioned that we are on the way to losing a generation of young people. I think that we all also agree that it is high time that something was done. Initial proposals were made in January this year or in December, so we have already wasted a couple of years with nothing but declarations of intent and a failure to tackle things in concrete terms; instead, responsibilities have been shifted to and fro at European level. I hope that is now in the past. Single-minded austerity is destroying the jobs of our young people. Growth creates jobs and training places, including for the young people of Europe, and also saves the costs of future social expenditure. What we need now is a rescue package for young people, for young Europeans, that is given just as much priority as was the rescue package for the banks. We found it easy to spend EUR 800 billion on rescuing the banks. It was right, and it was important, but we have to do it just as vehemently for something that will be much more important to us in the future, or at least equally as important. Alternatively, what about the EUR 82 billion that has not been spent from the Structural Funds? As the previous speaker has already said, we need to call off the money. That would give us EUR 15 000 to spend on each unemployed young person in Europe, if that would simplify things. Moreover, as the previous speaker mentioned, we also have to use the Structural Funds for this in the future. Together with my shadow rapporteurs, I have started initiatives for my report on the Programme for Social Change and Innovation, so that we very specifically allocate funding for a youth initiative. I hope, then, that I will also have the support of this Parliament, of the Commission and also of the Council in getting this funding, since everyone says that it is so important, and that this will also be anchored today in the other funds. This money could be very well used for the future of us all. Jutta Steinruck  (S&amp;D
). 
 – (DE)
 Mr President, I, too, would like to thank the rapporteur and, like the previous speaker, I welcome this regulation, on which we will be voting today. Europe’s internal market provides benefits for the workers, too, but sadly, in the past, loopholes in the law have been exploited in relation to cross-border mobility. One example of this – and this has been mentioned by a few of the previous speakers – concerns the airline business. Flight routes were often consciously chosen in such a way that airline staff were often socially insured in the Member State where social security was cheapest for the airline. This distorted competition, and it is an example of wage and social dumping, which takes place time and again at the expense of the workers. That is why we, as European Social Democrats, fought hard to ensure that airline staff are socially insured and have to pay their taxes where they are stationed. In a social Europe, there is no room for businesses that exploit the advantages of Europe’s single market while shirking the social responsibility that is the other side of the same coin. Jutta Steinruck  (S&amp;D
). 
 – (DE) 
Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, without quotas I would not be a Member of this House, but I am also self-confident enough to say that I do not do my work badly, nor am I a bad politician. I believe that the quotas fulfil their purpose, since, in the past, we had 100% male quotas, and the time has come for us to do away with them. The reality is that there is progress when it comes to equal rights for women in Europe. It may be at a snail’s pace, but fortunately the movement is in the right direction. Especially in times of crisis such as those in which we find ourselves at the moment, it becomes particularly clear that there is still major discrimination against women in the European labour market. Women are the first to be fired, in traditional female professions our salaries are currently going backwards in many cases, and women in executive roles continue to be in short supply, despite better qualifications from secondary and tertiary education. Today we have discussed how women in Europe – and this is not news to us – continue to earn less than their male colleagues. It is not enough to talk about this and to debate it, however. Ultimately, we have to also start to change fundamental structures. Professions that are mainly occupied by women are, as a rule, less well paid. We need new and more objective ways of evaluating work, while greater transparency in respect of salaries would also be an important step towards equal pay. The culture of silence in business keeps women in the dark about the fact that they earn less. If we had more transparency within companies, women could defend themselves better against this, and this needs to be tackled now, just as we need quotas on boards of directors, in executive roles or even in political positions.

 The budget consolidation must be based on the objectives of the Europe 2020 strategy. Since the beginning of the crisis, it has been clear that, in focusing on economic consolidation, the Commission and the Member States have forgotten that only balanced and socially just reforms will bring about sustainable growth. Unilateral austerity measures and cuts in social security funding will not result in a stable economy and good, secure jobs in the long term. Sensible tax policies must be introduced to increase revenue. The focus of our efforts this year must be on creating more jobs and combating youth unemployment and poverty. It is completely incomprehensible to me that the Group of the European People’s Party (Christian Democrats) has prevented Member States with a current account surplus from being required to help put an end to the recession and create jobs. This would have been a step towards a single European economic policy. The conservatives should finally understand that national egoism will only intensify the crisis. Jutta Steinruck  (S&amp;D

 Mr President, my question is for Commissioner Andor. As you know, my group has for quite some time been calling for the Posting of Workers Directive to be revised, and I find it very regrettable that the Commission has thus far not done so. It is not as if there is a shortage of reasons to do so: we have social dumping on a massive scale and the principle of equal treatment applies to too few criteria. Furthermore, there is often abuse of posted workers by means of failure to adhere to the rules. What we need is limits on subcontractor chains and more opportunities for information for workers. I therefore await the Commission’s proposals on the posting of workers package with baited breath. My question is this: how does the Commission proposal for the Enforcement Directive seek to tackle the problems with the Posting of Workers Directive that I have outlined? Most importantly, are there measures in the proposal to prevent the well-known problem of social dumping? Jutta Steinruck  (S&amp;D
). 
 – (DE)
 I have a specific follow-up question. You said that the aim was to improve on the original directive. In my initial question, I asked about limits on subcontractor chains, better opportunities for information for workers and better control mechanisms. I also wanted to know what specific steps are being taken to prevent social dumping in future. Jutta Steinruck  (S&amp;D

 I hope that today’s own-initiative report will be interpreted by the Commission in the way it was written by Parliament, because a directive on the transfer of company seats could have considerable negative effects on the rules on corporate codetermination. That applies not just to Germany, but throughout the European Union. The transfer of a company’s registered office could result in the loss of codetermination at corporate level. Transferring the company’s registered office to another country could allow the rules on corporate codetermination in Germany to be circumvented. At present, employees’ codetermination in a company is based on the Member State in which the company has its registered office. We are not talking about a nominal registered office; rather, the company must be registered where it actually has a genuine presence, such as business premises, employees, etc. In other words, it must have a genuine link with the state in which it is registered. We cannot allow the directive on transfers of company seats to be used to circumvent the rights of employees and creditors through the establishment of post-box offices abroad. If separation between the registered office and the administrative seat of a company is allowed, then social rights could effectively be eroded – and that is something we have to prevent. This can only work if the registered office of a company is in the country where it is actually based. That is the way to safeguard effectively the rights of employees in the European Union. I hope the Commission will safeguard social Europe, and the rights of its citizens, in its draft legislation. Jutta Steinruck  (S&amp;D

 Firstly, I would like to say that I am very pleased. This Presidency brings me pleasure in two ways. First of all, the Danish Government is headed by a woman and, secondly, she is a member of the right party. Given that 2012 is the ‘European Year for Active Ageing and Solidarity between the Generations’, I welcome the initiative by the Danish Presidency to encourage older people to join the labour market. The call for increased gender equality will also have a positive impact on labour markets throughout Europe. This is something that is urgently needed, in particular in the light of the demographic change which is underway in Europe. The younger generation has also not been forgotten. The focus will be on young people who leave the education system too early. The European Parliament has shown what it can do in this respect. During the negotiations on the so-called six-pack, we ensured that collective bargaining autonomy was protected as part of all the measures involved. The European Parliament will take this approach in many areas in future. We finally need to solve the problem of fiscal policy. Also, the regulation of the financial markets must remain high on the agenda. The European Parliament will work together with the Danish Presidency under the leadership of the social democratic Prime Minister Helle Thorning-Schmidt to resolve these issues. Jutta Steinruck,  
on behalf of the S&amp;D Group.

Madam President, I would like to thank the authors of the questions and the Commissioner for his statement. The German Social Democrats are also in favour of mobility and the free movement of workers on the European labour market. That is an important and key fundamental freedom. Although the facts dispel all fears, the German conservative-liberal Government is also no doubt planning to refuse to allow all workers to fully exercise this fundamental right. I find that very disappointing when I look at other European policy areas. In contrast to other countries, Germany has not made use of the transitional periods in order to make the German labour market fit for Europe. Time and again in Germany, I receive reports from colleagues from Romania and Bulgaria informing me of the methods being used in Germany. I can tell you that these are almost always bordering on illegal or are actually illegal. A further extension and a further denial of this fundamental right will only serve to promote fraud, undeclared employment and ostensible self-employment. It is not the influx of workers from Bulgaria and Romania that creates problems but the lack of fair conditions on the labour market. For us in Germany, these include the lack of a minimum wage and too little control of undeclared employment and combating of ostensible self-employment. Therefore, we must also put the principle of equal pay and equal working conditions for equal work in the same place into practice and introduce it in a uniform way at European level. Then, all workers within Europe will also be able to move around to work with dignity. (Applause) Jutta Steinruck  (S&amp;D

 I would like to thank Ms Delli for this report. The importance of health cannot be emphasised often enough. According to the European Agency for Safety and Health at Work in Bilbao, almost 28% of European workers claim to have significant health problems. This means that one in four workers in Europe is affected. Therefore, we must not only apply the existing occupational health legislation better in the Member States; we must also develop and improve it further, because the workplace is constantly changing, too. Whereas physical ailments were previously the top work-related illnesses, today it is mostly mental disorders that are on the rise in the workplace. This development, in particular, must be investigated thoroughly by means of improved health monitoring. The measures need to be adapted for this purpose. Prevention must also play a greater role. Furthermore, we must not forget that there are also certain groups whose health needs special protection. It has been proven that young, older and migrant workers and workers with precarious jobs are more frequently exposed to occupational hazards. If people are working without previous training or the necessary skills, the risk of disease or accident increases sharply. We must prevent this from happening. Jutta Steinruck  (S&amp;D

Madam President, this report is a good one and represents an important step in the right direction. Combating poverty and social exclusion is the responsibility of the Member States, but in the past, the national governments have not been sufficiently ambitious and have taken too few concrete measures. Well-meaning words are not enough. The current austerity policies in Europe, which have resulted in cuts in social budgets, are also creating more poverty in new areas. In the employment policy guidelines and the Europe 2020 strategy, we have set ourselves the goal of reducing the number of people at risk of poverty by 20 million. In my opinion, a key factor in this respect is employment, in the form of good jobs. A total of 8% of European employees are classified as working poor and 22% of the people at risk of poverty in Europe have a job. That is a quarter of the population. For this reason, we must begin by introducing fairer labour and social standards and minimum wages. Jutta Steinruck  (S&amp;D

The Professional Qualifications Directive is a key element in the integration of the labour market and an important step in achieving equal opportunities in European society. Many Member States have not yet implemented the directive and there are still far too many problems with recognition. This is also evident in the document from the Commission on which this own-initiative report is based. I welcome this report whole heartedly because it paves the way for the position the European Parliament is to adopt in relation to the promised revised directive at the beginning of next year. From an employment policy perspective, I would once again emphasise that we need to put an end quickly to the sometimes unfair practices found in the Member States. We cannot have a situation where, in many cases, qualifications are not recognised in order to keep wage costs low. This is clearly a problem of misalignment and is causing difficulties for immigrant job-seekers. This not only constitutes an infringement of the principle of equality, but also significantly restricts mobility within the workforce. The European Parliament needs to take a clear line on this in the forthcoming revision of the directive. I look forward to continued excellent cooperation. Jutta Steinruck  (S&amp;D

 Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, Nokia was exempted from paying tax in Romania for 30 years and only three years later is moving to Asia. Nokia received massive financial support for the construction of its plant in Bochum in Germany and then for its plant in Cluj in Romania. At the same time, the redundancies and the safeguards put in place for the employees were financed from public funds. I believe that it is dishonest to cite the crisis and production costs that are allegedly too high or, as has been mentioned today, environmental legislation as a justification for mass redundancies. Every employee at the plant in Cluj generates turnover of EUR 1 million each year and costs less than EUR 10 000 per year. We can no longer stand by and watch companies unscrupulously pocketing European money and then simply moving on like a plague of locusts. All the small agencies working on European projects have to sign contracts concerning the sustainability of their projects. Why does the same rule not apply to large companies? It is high time for us to introduce clear, tough regulations in this area. A voluntary approach and calls for compliance are completely useless. As long as companies like this exist, the European Globalisation Adjustment Fund, which is vitally important for workers in Europe, must not be called into question. We must help the people who are suffering. Jutta Steinruck  (S&amp;D

Madam President, ‘new skills and new jobs’ takes the form of guidelines for the Europe 2020 strategy and represents an important step towards increasing employment and growth. However, this must not mean that the labour markets are made more flexible unilaterally, without the involvement of unions and management, and, at the same time, that workers have little or no social protection. Flexicurity, a combination of security and flexibility, has so far only been used by the Member States as a magic word which will allow them to gradually increase flexibility and also to make working conditions more precarious. We do not want flexicurity under these circumstances. A cheap approach will not create jobs. We have established this during the discussion on the previous item. Therefore, I would like to emphasise once again that we are strongly opposed to the single open-ended contracts proposed by the Commission. From our perspective, offering contracts which will result in a lowering of social standards to young people who are starting work will not create one single job. Instead, it will play the different generations on the labour market off against one another. Labour market reforms must be negotiated with unions and management and must provide robust pension systems, training, employee rights and social security. We are very much opposed to interventions in the national systems for wage negotiations involving management and unions. I would like to thank everyone involved. I hope that tomorrow, we will adopt this positive report which would be further improved by the two amendments from the Group of the Progressive Alliance of Socialists and Democrats in the European Parliament.

 Public procurement not only needs to be made more flexible; it also needs to be made more sustainable. We must use the revision of the procurement directives as an opportunity for a change of strategy in favour of qualitative growth. We need to use public procurement to get rid of existing inequalities and to provide ecological incentives: it is a matter of good work on public contracts, adhering to collective agreements and maintaining and checking social and ecological standards. These requirements are more important than ever when faced with strict budgetary constraints. I am pleased that the report incorporates some of these demands, particularly the anchoring of social and ecological standards and the removal of the criterion of the cheapest offer. We need to maintain this line in the announced revision of the directives at the end of the year. We need to go even further, however: it is a matter of the protection of posted workers, compliance with working standards and collective pay agreements and good work. I hope that the Commission has noted the signal we have sent and will take it into consideration when making its proposals. Public procurement is not a market-based instrument for achieving the aims of the EU 2020 strategy, but rather needs to be used to develop the social and ecological aspects of the European project further.

Madam President, my question is directed at Mr Andor. A few weeks ago, Mr Andor, I visited a large building site in France along with other Members from my group to find out at first hand about how mobile European workers are being treated. Those employees in particular who were supplied by temporary employment agencies and who came from Poland, for example, were being subjected to appalling exploitation. Their working conditions were very poor. During this year alone, up to the time of our visit, three people had died in occupational accidents on the building site. The workers lived in dreadful conditions. Tax and social security contributions were deducted from their wages, but they had no right to health insurance. It was not clear where the taxes were actually going. This is just one of many examples of how the legal and also the illegal opportunities are being exploited. My questions are: What measures is the Commission planning to take to guarantee that the Posting of Workers Directive is implemented properly in the Member States? What proposals is the Commission making to prevent employees recruited through long chains of subcontractors from being exploited? Jutta Steinruck  (S&amp;D

Older women are discriminated against on two counts on the labour market: because of their gender on the one hand, and because of their age on the other. The consequence for women aged 65 and over is the prospect of a poverty-stricken old age. The increase in atypical, precarious employment, mostly involving women, is a growing problem in Europe. We must ensure that women aged between 55 and 64 remain in the labour market and are not sidelined. We must also to create the conditions that allow them to return to work. In the context of 2012 as the Year for Active Ageing, it is particularly important that the European Commission should redouble its efforts to improve the situation of older women and increase their participation in the labour market. Strengthening equality policy and increasing training opportunities are just two ways in which we can improve the situation of older women in the labour market in the long term. A good work-life balance is the key here. Different phases in life are associated with different demands on women in terms of family and professional commitments and should not be punished with pension reductions. Jutta Steinruck  (S&amp;D

 In its communication on social services of general interest the Commission already admitted last year that not all the Member States have the financial means to meet the growing demand for social services. In some countries there are, in fact, gaping holes in the social safety nets. It is important that we now fill these gaps. Mr De Rossa’s report is an important step in this direction, with the aim that social services may continue to facilitate social equality and social integration in the immediate future. The European Commission’s one-sided political concentration on the rules of the internal market is a big mistake. Budgetary consolidation at all costs is not the solution. The public sector has become the main target of all the austerity measures which are aimed at bringing budget deficits back into line following the rescue packages given to banks threatened with bankruptcy. The loss of public services will only increase the suffering of those who have been particularly hard hit by the current crisis in many Member States. I welcome the European Voluntary Quality Framework, which aims to ensure high quality even in difficult times. This is, moreover, a voluntary quality framework that includes the stakeholders in the process, and its principles support the quality systems of the Member States. I hope that the Commission will continue along the lines set out in Mr De Rossa’s report and its own communication from last year; in other words, that it will ‘fill the gaps’ rather than tearing open new holes.

 The subject of the management of spent fuel and radioactive waste is highly topical. Recent events in Japan have once again highlighted the immediate risks which affect workers and citizens who are exposed to radioactive material. We have many tonnes of radioactive waste in Europe which people have to move about. I am pleased that we can lay the foundations which will help to protect these people’s health throughout the whole of Europe. We have produced a report in Parliament which is based on the Commission’s technical report and which puts the focus on people, including employees of transport companies and plants which work with radioactive waste and employees at the final storage sites. Therefore, the members of the Committee on Employment and Social Affairs have focused on protecting the workers involved by putting in place safety measures, health protection measures and training for employees on the subject of radioactive waste. Economic interests must never be given a higher priority than the health of workers and citizens. Therefore, we need comprehensive documentation of all the waste and its management, while it remains harmful to people and the environment. I am pleased that so many of our requirements have been included in the final report by the Committee on Industry, Research and Energy. Jutta Steinruck  (S&amp;D

 I welcome the report on European cooperation in vocational education and training and would like to emphasise how important it is to promote lifelong learning through initiatives and Europe-wide programmes in order to make it possible for workers to have a better future. These days, workers are at the mercy of frequent and risky employment transitions. There are many types of transition: from training, redundancy, internships or precarious employment into full-time employment. The report contains some important points, including increasing the quota of women in work, recognition of informal learning and promotion of languages with the goal of providing mobility programmes. I am particularly pleased that the focus has been placed on education and training for young people, which is something that I will actively support in the flagship initiatives that follow. The transition from educational institution to working life must be as smooth as possible and, in particular, tailored to individual needs, because it must also be possible for young people with inadequate training to gain the skills necessary to be able to work in skilled jobs and to earn a good living. Social background must not determine a person’s educational opportunities. Young people must be given help and support in securing entry to the world of work. However, the cost of a modern labour market policy must not be borne by our workers. Jutta Steinruck,  
rapporteur for the opinion of the Committee on Employment and Social Affairs.

 Mr President, let us get back on topic. As rapporteur for the opinion of the Committee on Employment and Social Affairs, I would like to thank everyone who worked on this report. In the committee, all the groups pursued the unanimous objective of making education and training possible for every young person in Europe and supporting their entry into a career, while no young person should fall by the wayside. I did not base my opinion for the committee on the Commission report, as I found it too unspecific. It was important to me for very specific tasks, too, to be listed in the report. In some cases, I was unable to support the positions taken in the report. In the view of the Committee on Employment and Social Affairs, one important aspect is the transition from school to career. It is a core interface. This transition must take place without time spent waiting around. We also found it important that young people’s entry into their careers should not be associated with social dumping and that it must not take place under conditions of dumping. We felt that the role of traineeships was important. They are important and they are necessary, but their abuse must be avoided and forbidden. We would like to see an initiative for a European qualifications framework laying down minimum standards for traineeships. I will close with a request of Parliament and the Commission to ensure that the Youth in Action programme does not suffer financial cuts or even abolition in favour of the Youth on the Move programme. The work of youth associations is important for social engagement and helps young people progress, both in terms of substance and personally. That is also a major advantage for later working life.

 This report shone the spotlight on an occupational category that is all too often neglected. What would European culture be without creative artists? While developing the creative industries economically, we must not forget those who work in this sector. As the shadow rapporteur for my group in the Committee on Employment and Social Affairs, the social situation and the conditions in which creative artists in Europe live are particularly important. Unfortunately, many of the 5 million people who make their livelihoods from the creative sector live in precarious conditions. Second and third jobs are not rare, as one job is often not enough to live on. A lack of health and pension insurance is on the agenda. Contracts are mostly uncertain, and many creative workers are scarcely able to plan more than a couple of months in advance. Moreover, a fair level of social security protection, with adequate insurance against unemployment, sickness and for old age, must be standard practice also for those working in the creative sector. I am very pleased to see that the rapporteur followed the position of the Committee on Employment and Social Affairs in this regard and included it in the report. It is now time for the Commission and the Member States to remedy these social deficiencies and to promise the many creative minds of Europe that creative artists in Europe need not live as an underclass.

 Mr President, it is very significant that the Member who asked the question has left the room during the discussion. The arguments and questions put by some of the previous speakers once again demonstrate a highly revealing populist mindset. We are in the midst of a crisis and, as usual, savings are being made in areas which affect the workers. I think that this is a very one-sided approach. I would like to look briefly at the European Training Foundation (ETF). It is important because of its cooperation with the International Labour Organisation (ILO) in the EU’s partner countries. It enables the European social model to be exported to acceding countries and provides help with developing education, vocational training and further education programmes and with creating secure jobs. Two weeks ago, I was in Belgrade and, in meetings with education and training providers, I was once again assured of the importance of the agency. The same thing happened in meetings in Turkey. The ETF plays a very important role in helping the acceding countries to enter the EU labour market. If we take a more far-sighted approach, the Arab spring is also very important. We do not want large numbers of refugees to come to Europe, so we must offer people support in their home countries. We must provide education and help the countries to develop training programmes and facilities. Jutta Steinruck  (S&amp;D

 Mr President, Commissioner, I sometimes have the feeling that you should try out all these solutions on the Commission itself so that you could see what impact you are actually having on Europe. Following your speech, I am left with the impression that the Commission really does sit in an ivory tower. The people of Europe – the workers, the low earners and the pensioners – are really picking up the bill, and you are interpreting legislation and competences however you please. On 19 October last year, I received a response to a question that I had put to the Commission in which it was explicitly confirmed that minimum wages and wages in general are the responsibility of the Member States. The response states this very emphatically. Please read it. It is not acceptable for you to give me that kind of answer when it is a good thing for employers and then simply change direction when you believe something is good for the other side. That will make the people of Europe really very unhappy. My fellow Member has just mentioned this. You are chipping away at codetermination. You are weakening the trade unions. That is not the way out of the crisis and you are fully aware of that. Those who caused the crisis must also be the ones to pay for it. (Applause) Jutta Steinruck  (S&amp;D

As we discuss the report by Mrs Nedelcheva today, the 100th anniversary of International Women’s Day, it is high time for us finally to follow up our words with deeds. The disadvantage suffered by women in Europe can only be combated effectively if we introduce binding rules instead of voluntary commitments. These include mandatory women’s quotas on corporate boards, as well as all other levels, the consistent combating of precarious employment conditions, which affect women far more than men, the improvement of career prospects for women during education by systematically expanding the range of careers open to them, a ban on financial disadvantage to women in taxation and income, statutory equality plans in business and industry in order to promote women, and regular checks and reports on the progress achieved in Europe, if any. Let me conclude by saying this: After 100 years of International Women’s Day, we women will no longer be satisfied with simple lip-service. We want binding statutory regulations and we want final recognition that the work of women makes a decisive contribution to our prosperity. Jutta Steinruck  (S&amp;D

 Madam President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, the Europe 2020 Strategy is very important, not only for the development of European social and economic policy, but also for national social and economic policy. We must take care to ensure that this strategy is not misused at European level to pursue a social clearance policy in the Member States. I am extremely shocked that, in its Annual Growth Survey, the Commission is proposing pay cuts and a reduction in social protection. Some previous speakers have already talked about this. The impact on the people locally will be disastrous. It is unacceptable for the people, the workers, to bear the costs of budgetary consolidation alone. I, too, would like to appeal to the Member States to be guided only by the integrated guidelines when they draw up their national reform programmes, as these enable a much better balance between social protection and economic growth. The Annual Growth Survey once again mentions open-ended contracts, which were previously mentioned in the Agenda for New Skills for New Jobs. Mr Andor, we debated this once before in November 2010: young people cannot be integrated into the labour market by watering down employee rights. Experience in Europe has shown that this watering down simply results in a shift to precarious working conditions and does not create new jobs. We need specific measures in order to help those people who are most at risk and not flagship initiatives that operate alongside each other rather than being integrated with one another. Jutta Steinruck  (S&amp;D

 Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, pensions throughout Europe must provide enough money for people to live on. One important requirement is that people have decent jobs, because low paid jobs result in poverty in old age and inadequate pension provision. When I hear other Members of this House saying that people simply need to take out an additional private pension for their old age, I want to reply that many people can barely survive on what they earn, never mind paying for an additional private pension. This is why the first pillar of the pension system is of particular importance. The pay-as-you-go system based on the solidarity principle must form the foundation of European pensions and it must provide enough for people to live on. We cannot simply say that this is a matter for the Member States. We must send out a clear signal that we need pensions which give people enough money to have a reasonable quality of life. Mr Mann gave a detailed description of the German occupational pension system. I would like to mention it too, without going into the same level of detail. In my assessment of the Green Paper, I have come to the same conclusion, which is why we worked on the amendments together in committee. Therefore, I am calling on the Commission to ensure that, in everything which we do in future, the distinctive features of each country – the things that really work well and are essential for the survival of the pension systems in the Member States – are not disregarded. Jutta Steinruck  (S&amp;D

 Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, the free movement of workers, the freedom of establishment and the freedom to provide services are vital pillars of our internal market. Of course, these must not act as a gateway for social dumping. Service providers must respect the law of the State in which they operate. The country of destination principle must thus also be enforced consistently. For that to happen, all the Member States must also do their homework. My home country of Germany has not done its homework in this regard, as there is quite clearly a lack of framework conditions for fair mobility and social security. There are no binding wage floors in many areas, the monitoring of undeclared work is inadequate and we have fictive self-employment as a common way of circumventing labour law. As Mr Geier already said, we also need advice centres in different languages for posted workers, not just for companies. If the freedom to provide services is also to benefit workers, there is still some homework to be done. Jutta Steinruck  (S&amp;D

 Mr President, Mr Andor, Mrs Vassiliou, it is true that combating unemployment and the goal of full employment together represent one of our most urgent tasks. As Mrs Harkin said, the people of Europe do not want concepts; they want concrete solutions. I would like to thank you for your initiative. There are a lot of positive approaches here which two colleagues from my group have referred to. However, I believe that some improvements are needed, because more flexibility and more mobility will not create a single new job. I would like to endorse what Mrs Schroedter said in this respect. We need good, secure jobs in Europe and the Member States and businesses must ensure that these are permanent jobs which allow people to earn a good living. This must become a general rule once again and we must work towards this on a European level and choose the right course. In the agenda, you refer to new forms of employment contract with fewer rights for employees who are just starting their careers. You refer to these as open-ended contractual arrangements. In my view, this will not create any new jobs. Experience shows, and the Social Democratic government in Germany found this out a few years ago, that weakening employees’ rights will not result in any jobs being created. Measures of this kind simply turn secure jobs into precarious jobs. We must not allow this to happen in future. Jutta Steinruck  (S&amp;D

 Since the financial crisis of 2008, the G20 Heads of State or Government have been meeting regularly every six months to discuss economic and financial issues and to bolster cooperation in order to achieve stable and sustainable growth for the world economy for the benefit of all. However, I believe that, in order to find a sustainable and appropriate response to the financial, economic or social problems of the crisis, we need a broader-based approach and a more balanced perspective on these problems. The Finance Ministers of the Member States are not in a position to evaluate the situation on the labour market and to come up with answers to the pressing labour and social policy issues that give due consideration to the needs of workers or the people in general. I therefore call for regular meetings of the Ministers for Employment and Social Affairs in the G20. Moreover, I call on the EU and those Member States that are also members of the G20 to develop this idea further and to cooperate more closely with one another in the field of employment and social policy and to aim for a more balanced approach at summit level. We cannot allow competition to undermine the protection of workers’ rights. We need to enforce these rights, not only for the citizens of the European Union, but also for the citizens of other countries around the world. Jutta Steinruck  (S&amp;D

 Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, what I feel is missing from this debate is the necessary distinction between national transposition in the Member States and the task that exists at European level. We all realise that we need to take the special features of individual nations into account. However, where the debate in Germany is concerned, for example, I must say that I can definitely see how Germany could implement this report. What we are concerned with here is creating minimum standards at EU level to establish social framework conditions for women. We are always keen to make reference to the ILO when it comes to good work, protection at work and protecting health, so I ask myself: why not in this case? As far as the debate on costs is concerned, I would like to remind everyone in this House that in Germany – as well as in some other European countries – the anti-discrimination directive brought about a huge amount of lobbying on the part of enterprises. There was talk of an avalanche of costs, of companies going bankrupt, of burdens on the economy and on workers themselves. Looking back years later, how much of this happened? None of it. I find this debate, this lobbying, very reminiscent of that time. I urge you at last to put the economy on one side and to put people at the heart of what we do. I am not one of those merely sermonising here. I have stated that I advocate a social Europe. For me, that includes women. In this situation, women need our help. Jutta Steinruck  (S&amp;D

 The experience of countries where liberalisation has already taken place shows that liberalisation of postal services is a downward spiral. Competition must not be played out at the expense of workers, in other words on the basis of pay and working conditions. We must retain high quality jobs in the European postal service, because that is the only way that we will be able to guarantee the universal service for everyone. Postal services must be equally accessible to everyone, wherever they live – it must be a basic right. It is the Commission’s job to protect the citizens of the European Union from social dumping and to maintain labour standards. So far, however, nothing has been done. The opening up of European markets must not go hand in hand with the abolition of social protection rights. We reject the competition between the social systems of the Member States. I call for a moratorium until the social impact has been investigated, social conditions are secure throughout the postal market, the financing of the universal services is ensured and a way is found for competition to be based on quality and innovation in the market. Member States must provide legislative guarantees of the full accessibility of postal services. Jutta Steinruck  (S&amp;D

 Mr President, I would like to ask the Council to take note of our vote today and I would like to request a brief statement. Jutta Steinruck,  
on behalf of the S&amp;D Group.
 – (DE) 
Madam President, I would like to begin my speech with a criticism of the procedure. Parliament’s work has been greatly impaired by the late tabling of this report. It was only really able to present its position because exceptions were made and the Council is not now going to debate this matter until the autumn summit. In the end, a workable compromise was found. The cooperation between the rapporteur and the shadow rapporteurs was excellent. That can also be seen by the fact that we received a clear majority for our position in committee. As Social Democrats, we were able to include very many of our key concerns, although we are not happy with every point. However, I am grateful for the assurance from the Belgian Presidency that it will support Parliament’s position. In order to facilitate this procedure, we have tabled four amendments, for which we request support in tomorrow’s vote. It was important to us that the guidelines for employment policies contain social components, in other words, a definition of good work, the stipulation that good work must also be well paid, and that testable interim goals are also laid down. However, the guidelines will only be taken seriously in the Member States if the Commission and the Council take them seriously. We therefore ask the Commission to ensure that appropriate measures are implemented and that the results are also examined. I am pleased that the Commissioner has assured us that our positions will be included, because Parliament has added a very socially-orientated and worker-friendly component which will benefit the people of Europe. That is also what people expect of this Parliament and this represents an improvement in social conditions. Jutta Steinruck  (S&amp;D
). 
 – (DE)
 Mr President, Mr Barroso, Mr Van Rompuy, it is important that we all work together to promote growth and employment and attempt to eliminate the causes of the crisis. However, our goal must be to learn from our previous mistakes and not to make those mistakes again. One subject which we must not lose sight of and which is particularly important to me is the fight against poverty. It is a pity that the European Heads of Government were not prepared to commit to implementing the Commission proposals on combating poverty as quickly as possible. The message sent out by the Council last week is that Europe does not care about the poorest people. The original goals have been watered down. All that remains are three key figures and the objective of lifting 20 million people out of poverty. That is not enough and it is clear that there is a real lack of political will in this respect. We had really hoped that the Commission proposal to reduce poverty by 25% would be adopted and taken forward, because poverty ultimately represents a risk for Europe. Jutta Steinruck  (S&amp;D
). 
 – (DE) 
Madam President, of course we need economic governance and, of course, the Member States must consolidate and restructure their budgets. However, what we are now seeing is a radical reduction in the social budget. Unemployment and poverty are increasing and people do not understand why banks and companies are receiving support while the politicians simply pay lip service to combating poverty and unemployment and put in place objectives that cannot be monitored. This is why the Europe 2020 strategy and the integrated guidelines are so important. We want to continue striving for the goal of full employment and we want proper work, not vulnerable jobs. When it comes to combating poverty, our goals really must be more ambitious. This is why we are calling on the Council to take up the Commission’s proposal to reduce poverty in Europe by 25%. The European Parliament has specific objectives and it is important for Parliament to be taken seriously. Jutta Steinruck  (S&amp;D
). 
 – (DE) 
Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, I would like to appeal once more to the conservatives and liberals that we cannot here place the interests of the self-employed above the safety of the people of Europe. Entrepreneurial freedom is undoubtedly a very good thing, but the safety of our children and of everyone on the roads is more important – and that, to my mind, is the responsible way for Europe to act. Tomorrow’s vote is an opportunity to show that you are not in favour of social dumping. What this debate has also shown in recent months is that a debate on ostensible self-employment in Europe is long overdue. More and more regular employment relationships are being ousted by ostensible self-employment, which is why we urgently need the situation to be analysed and a proposal to be made for what we can do about it. As the Commissioner stated quite clearly today, we have had many declarations of intent on this matter. It is time to act at last. Jutta Steinruck  (S&amp;D
).  
– (DE)
 Mr President, Mr Mann, I hope you are in regular contact with your Chancellor, if you see things in the same way that I do. The EU 2020 strategy is a real opportunity to make Europe more social and we need that opportunity at this very moment when many hostile words are directed at Europe and when it has distanced itself from the people. We absolutely need to offer something positive to our citizens that will offset that situation. When it comes to growth and employment, we should stop putting people’s interests behind those of business. Indeed, that must be the key objective of the EU 2020 strategy because Europe needs social progress. I already pointed that out last Monday at the committee debate on employment policy guidelines: we must not lose sight of the goal of full employment, but we cannot have full employment at all costs because we need good jobs. We always say we need jobs, but what matters to me is that these jobs are good, that there is social security, that people do not have to receive subsidies and that they can actually make a living from these jobs. The ever more precarious nature of working life, the increasing income inequality and also growing poverty – which many speakers have talked about today – must finally be brought to an end with the EU 2020 strategy. We need a more active labour market policy and one which covers many areas. Finally, people expect more specific answers, very specific answers, in fact, and not an umpteenth strategy! Jutta Steinruck  (S&amp;D

 Yesterday, the media told us that the Opel plant in Antwerp will close. This is just one of many examples of jobs being lost in Europe. Next Thursday, the European industrial trade unions will be holding a day of demonstrations throughout Europe. They are calling for jobs and the future of Europe as an industrial base to be safeguarded. The trade union members want full employment, but they also want effective European policies and definitive answers today, not in five years’ time. Your work programme does not provide very definitive information in this respect. You have just referred to the guidelines and the Europe 2020 position paper. In my view, this is not specific enough. You should provide examples. What do you plan to do to re-establish our strategically important industrial sectors in Europe and what role is the Commission playing in making the automotive industry future-proof and in safeguarding jobs? Jutta Steinruck  (S&amp;D
).  
– (DE)
 Commissioner Špidla, Madam President, the Commission should protect European interests and on that point I agree with what previous speakers have said. The Commission should reconsider its approach. From tomorrow, General Motors will be trying to rake in EUR 2.7 billion worth of public aid across Europe, without contributing a single cent of their own. We have to make it clear that Europe, i.e. the Commission, will not make any money available if that means that further plants will be shut down or that production will relocate outside Europe. However, at the same time, Member States should not support General Motor’s plans to that effect and should not think only about saving their own plants. We should not allow workers to be played off against one another, nor should Member States allow themselves to be so, because any such divisions would result in further off-shoring. The European taxpayer and Opel’s other workers in Europe should not foot that bill. Nobody will understand that over there! People want to understand what the European Union is doing. Whatever plans General Motors might have for Europe, the Commission should ensure that they play to European rules. The European Works Council has proposed a solidarity-based solution and a sound financial rescue plan for Opel, whereby all the plants would remain in Europe and whereby adjustments would be made in all plants on the basis of solidarity. Management should not be allowed to ignore this plan, nor should Mr Reilly and his colleagues disregard the consultation process with the European Works Council or the rights of consultation and participation which we have secured for European workers. A solidarity-based European solution for Opel is possible, but the Commission must get involved. Jutta Steinruck  (S&amp;D

 Madam President, I have a comment to make on what our fellow Member has said about there not being enough German MEPs attending this debate. Although I am a German Social Democrat, I share your criticism of the Minister of North Rhine-Westphalia, who is a member of the CDU, having said that he was pleased that it was the plant in Antwerp, rather than the one in Bochum, that was being closed down. We, the German Social Democrats, are in favour of a European solution, in other words, the plan put forward by the European Works Council. Let me say this very clearly once again: I have no idea why the German Conservatives and Liberals have shirked this debate. Jutta Steinruck  (S&amp;D
). 
 – (DE)
 Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, this is actually about finding a common European solution, rather than about national egotism. Opel Europe has a significant role to play in industrial policy in Europe and this is not only about jobs at Opel, but also about jobs in many automotive supply companies in a number of European countries. The decision in favour of Magna – and the European Works Council has confirmed this for me – achieved a consensus in the European Works Council, too, and its members are working flat out on European solutions. The workers are ready to make sacrifices for this cause, and we expect the same from all the decision makers. Everyone needs to work together, and to do so quickly. Previous speakers have already talked about this. In the interests of the workers, it also makes sense, of course, for thousands of jobs truly to be temporarily stabilised with State aid. We will not grant validity to any competition arguments that have been put forward. We are dealing with people and with jobs, but also with whole regions. The path that we were put on under Germany’s auspices must now lead to the best possible result for all European workers, across all European sites. Kerstin Westphal,

Madam President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen. I can only say that patience is its own reward. The report on type approval for Category L vehicles has turned out well in the end. The work took longer, overall, than we all thought it would – certainly longer than we hoped it would – and there were a lot more pitfalls along the way than we would have liked. However, I would like, at this point, to thank the rapporteur, Mr van de Camp, most warmly for his excellent cooperation. Together we achieved a lot in our talks with the Member States. As rapporteur for my group, I commend this report to the House – even though it could have been better. By better I mean safer. For us Social Democrats, the emphasis right from the start was on the safety of vehicles and thus the safety of their drivers, above all those driving scooters and motorcycles. The figures for motorcycle accidents have remained constant for years. Basically the number of fatal accidents is declining in Europe – apart from those involving motorcycles. Cutting the number of motorcycle and scooter fatalities is something I feel passionate about. Fewer deaths on Europe’s roads was and is my goal. Each death is one death too many. In a regulation that brings so much benefit to the internal market, this issue must be addressed with vigour. I remain convinced that this can be achieved through effective anti-lock braking systems (ABS). I am equally convinced that they are cost-effective. It just is not true that ABS is too expensive. Anyway, we have secured a mandatory requirement that manufacturers must, as of 2016, fit all new motorcycles of 125 cc and over, and from 2017 all existing motorcycles of that capacity, with ABS.  Motor scooters may be fitted, at the choice of the vehicle manufacturer, with ABS or a combined brake system. In this respect, it must be said, unfortunately, that we have not managed to improve on the Commission’s proposal. I would have liked to have achieved a lot more here, but the Commission and Member States were – I choose my words carefully – very slow to move forward on the whole business. However, we secured the promise of a Commission report in 2019. The report is to include road accident figures from the Member States and will consider the mandatory fitting of ABS to motor scooters. It will be forwarded to Parliament and the Council. On the basis of the report, the Commission will then decide whether or not to make the fitting of ABS to motor scooters mandatory. As you can see, this remains very much a work in progress. Thus we shall seek to close the loophole in the law in 2019. I am sure the figures we receive will vindicate me. I am convinced that this is indeed a good day for two-wheeler riders in Europe, and that we shall see a drop in the accident figures in future. Kerstin Westphal,  
rapporteur.

 Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, demographic change is one of the most important themes in our times. For example, we know that every second girl born in Germany today will live to see their 100th birthday. My 13-year-old daughter was happy when she heard this news. However politicians must naturally also respond to this fact, drawing conclusions and establishing general political conditions. My report, which will be the subject of a vote tomorrow, deals with some of these conclusions and the associated general conditions. It does not deal with social issues such as pensions. This is quite simply beyond the remit of the Committee on Regional Development. What it does consider, however, is the question of what European cohesion policy can do and how we can organise future cohesion policy in order to respond to the pressing issues. I would like to draw attention to four areas mentioned in the report. Firstly: we need to tailor European cohesion policy more closely than ever to demographic change. Demographic change continues to play quite an important role in the Europe 2020 strategy and in the legislative proposals. Now, as we come to implement the strategy, we must ensure that the topic remains on the agenda. The second area relates to infrastructure: we need infrastructure suitable to the needs of older people in order to avoid social exclusion. This includes accessibility to public buildings, for example. This move would also benefit other groups, such as families with small children or people with disabilities. At the same time, we need to make areas affected by emigration more attractive, particularly to young families. The third area relates to older people, children and families. More and more older people live in the various regions of Europe. Regional policy must respond to this fact. For me, this also means promoting so-called multi-generational housing, as well as European Regional Development Fund (ERDF) and European Social Fund (ESF) support in the social and health care sectors. Also, when it comes to the prevention of emigration, I believe that well-qualified full-time day care for children plays a very important role. It is a pity that the majority in the committee were not in favour of providing free child care. I would have liked to see much more courage here. The fourth area of concern is employment. Our prime concern here must be to combat unemployment among women and young people. We have a cohort of young women who are the best-educated generation in Europe of all time. If these women are denied employment opportunities, then we could be accused of being responsible ourselves for creating the shortage of specialist professionals. It is also important that we should make much more use of the knowledge and experience of older people. Appropriate structures must also be established for this purpose in the regions. I believe we all agree that we need to take an active approach by shaping demographic change rather than just managing it. European regional policy can make a huge contribution here. I would like to thank all the members of the committee who have worked on this report. This has been a long journey and several people have grown old and even retired while the work went on. The result has been worth the effort, however. I think we have produced a good report and I hope that the majority will vote in favour at tomorrow’s plenary. Kerstin Westphal  (S&amp;D
). 
 – (DE)
 Mr President, Mr Hahn, Mr Andor, ladies and gentlemen, I do not need to emphasise how important cohesion and regional policy is for the process of living together and growing together in Europe. However, I also believe that in future, regional policy and cohesion policy must focus more closely on our cities. Cities are an important driving force behind development in Europe. At the same time, they are currently suffering from environmental, economic and social problems. This is why I have a particular question for Mr Hahn. What opportunities do you think there are for highlighting the urban dimension? To come to the point, Mr Hahn, you recently indicated during an event which took place in this House that you had a specific percentage of the regional funding in mind which would be reserved for highlighting the urban dimension. Is this still the case? If so, what percentage were you thinking of? Kerstin Westphal  (S&amp;D
),  
in writing. 
– On behalf of the S&amp;D Group, I want to express our general consent to this report. It is important that the European Parliament fights for greater transparency in regional policy, but we reject the so-called ‘naming and shaming’, as asked for in point 16 of this report. We certainly agree to a tougher line on communication and information requirements, but the goal of more transparency – which we also support – should not be achieved by the wrong means. We are afraid of having a ‘witch-hunt’ when naming and shaming is carried out. The European Commission should not be made a moral authority which achieves group discipline by naming, shaming or blaming. We also reject this approach as it could lead to a more complex situation and non-implementation in the Member States. Despite this concern, we agree – as stated above – with the general ideas of the report and think it is very helpful. Kerstin Westphal  (S&amp;D
).  
– (DE)
 Mr President, I would like to come back to the report by Mr Cortés Lastra, which I think is a very good report. Indeed, the Cohesion policy is actually the best instrument for mobilising investment in growth and employment. However, I would like to highlight again the importance of towns and cities here, because they will play a key role in achieving the objectives of the EU 2020 strategy. Four out of five Europeans live in urban areas. Towns and cities are the driving force of economic growth in Europe. At the same time, they are experiencing many problems particularly acutely. Key words here are social integration, the environment and transport, for example, but also demographic change. Therefore, towns and cities have a particular role when it comes to actually improving the living conditions of citizens. In addition, Europe’s towns and cities are key players in the fields of innovation, research and education, and therefore play a fundamental role in the implementation of the Lisbon Strategy and the EU 2020 strategy. All of this should be taken into account during the implementation of these strategies and during the shaping of the future course of the Cohesion policy. Knut Fleckenstein  (S&amp;D
).

Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, in this year’s enlargement strategy, the Commission has defined the key issues very accurately. Our rapporteur has reiterated them very effectively. It is about the credibility of our policies, honesty towards the EU’s citizens and the citizens of the candidate countries, and clarity on the criteria, which must be fulfilled prior to accession. We cannot pursue policies which bypass public opinion in the EU Member States. Public opinion in many countries is sceptical towards further rounds of enlargement. It is therefore the task of policy-makers – not only the task of the Commission but our task too – to bring clarity to the accession process and to explain it more effectively at home. Any country which successfully completes the accession negotiations will have progressed through a lengthy reform process and will have incorporated many of our legal provisions into its system of governance. An improved enlargement process does not mean offering a firm timetable but creating more clarity for the steps along the road towards accession. That is why we must send out a clear signal. Firstly, we want to keep the EU’s door open to the European countries because an enlarged EU offers all of us security, democracy and prosperity. Secondly, any country embarking on the road towards accession should be able to count on support from all of us. Thirdly, however, the pace of progress towards accession will ultimately depend on how quickly the accession criteria can be fulfilled and implemented. We know from experience that ‘rebates’ are not helpful here. Let me give some advice to my German colleagues in the House and at home: we Germans should not always act as if we were expecting to have to pick up the tab at the end of the process! We have profited to such an extent from previous enlargements that I feel sure that we can look forward to the next stage in a calm and confident manner! Knut Fleckenstein  (S&amp;D

Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, WTO membership can definitely support the urgently needed modernisation of the Russian economy, through easing technology transfer and improving investment security – these are just two examples. It is just two years since Russia agreed on a partnership for modernisation with the EU for the same reasons; the declared aims of this partnership include the alignment of technical standards, the extension of investment opportunities in key sectors for innovation and growth and the general strengthening of trade relations – all these are improved by WTO accession. However, successful accession to the WTO may perhaps merely give Russia more of a voice in other international bodies. Russia will only benefit from membership of it actually implements the joint agreement on trade facilitation. A partnership with the EU for modernisation only makes sense if Russia complies with its WTO obligations. Cherry picking, WTO à la carte – there are so many pleasing expressions for what we can to some extent still see Russia doing, what Russia is doing with its membership at the moment. The EU advocated for a long time that Russia should at last be a member of the World Trade Organisation and we will prove a reliable partner to our Russian friends in the future, but this relationship cannot function in one direction only. Even the joint project, which has already taken so long, i.e. the joint partnership agreement, can now be facilitated through the WTO accession on either side, since the rules no longer have to be negotiated – they are established. However – there are two conditions: the Russians must really comply, and the EU cannot pile on more conditions. Knut Fleckenstein  (S&amp;D
).

 Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I would like to highlight two points. You probably cannot tell this from looking at me, but I am not a fan of punk music. We are now all familiar with one punk group and that is Pussy Riot. I see the situation slightly differently from Baroness Ashton, but the subject of whether this was a civil protest or simply hooliganism which caused deep offence to other people is open to discussion. We can perhaps even discuss what the penalty for this sort of behaviour should be. We all agree that a two-year sentence is far too long. However, what should concern us and, most importantly, what should concern the Russians in their own country is the clear indication that this trial is once again an example of the political system exerting influence on the judicial system. That is totally unacceptable. My second point concerns the NGO act, which, as has already been said, has deliberately vague wording so that it can be interpreted as required. We need to set clear boundaries. The best thing to do would be to put this act where it belongs, in other words, in the rubbish bin. However, ladies and gentlemen, there is one thing you cannot say to me, which is that we must now evaluate everything we do together with Russia. I am firmly convinced, and we discussed this 10 days ago with our Russian colleagues in St Petersburg, that the only sensible way forward is to continue to talk to them and to Russian civil society, in order to get things moving. I am not one of those who believe that a discussion of resolutions by less than 3% of the Members of the European Parliament has better prospects for success. Knut Fleckenstein  (S&amp;D

Blue-card question.
 – (DE)
 Mr Posselt, do you also believe that the clear language spoken by this Parliament has not been as successful as we might have hoped and, therefore, that we need both approaches? We need to work together and to develop projects together, but we must also make our opinions clear in the hope that there will be progress. My second question is this. Would you be of the same opinion, as a devout Catholic, if all of this had happened in the Vatican or in your church in Munich? For you, that would probably have been the equivalent of the collapse of Western civilisation. Knut Fleckenstein  (S&amp;D

 Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, the talks between Belgrade and Priština here in Brussels were an initial success. I would like to say that this took a lot of courage on the part of Prime Minister Thaçi and President Tadić. We should recognise their courage because this is the first step in the right direction and a requirement for further positive developments. Now it is our job to show the people of Kosovo that we are serious. This is why we are supporting Ms Malmström in her commitment to visa liberalisation and why we are supporting you, Mr Füle, concerning the feasibility study for a Stabilisation and Association Agreement. You can rely on our solidarity, if you take action in this area. However, there is one thing that we should make clear, which applied in the past and will still apply in the future. Both sides must be aware that they can only make progress towards joining the EU together and in parallel. Neither side will be able to achieve this at the expense of the other. We will not tolerate that. Knut Fleckenstein  (S&amp;D
). 
 – (DE)
 Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I am convinced that the progress to greater democracy in Russia is no longer stoppable. I am also convinced, however, that our Parliament, our groups, the parties behind these groups and the foundations could, and must, do more to help Russia as good friends and advisors. Since the Duma elections, there have been numerous demonstrations and the involvement of civil society has increased dramatically. It is not only politicians who have taken to the streets; there are also many citizens, consisting increasingly of middle class, well-educated people and people who have educated themselves further through travel. We need to step up our dialogue and increase our contact with these people and ensure that there is more people-to-people contact, including by dealing swiftly with the outstanding issues relating to visa-free travel. However, we should step up our parliamentary dialogue now, too. I know that some people think less dialogue is the right response to the elections. I think that is wrong. We need more talks with our colleagues from the State Duma in order to discuss and to persuade and to offer them our experience. In so doing, we should present our views clearly so that our colleagues there can also learn from our experience and avoid the mistakes that we have made, and continue to make. We will best achieve this through clear dialogue and by showing as little as possible of the superior attitude that we sometimes see in this House. The Partnership for Modernisation is a good instrument for this purpose. We surely all agree that economic and technological modernisation is not sufficient and that without modernisation of the law, politics and society, Russia, and therefore our joint partnership, cannot succeed.

 Mr President, Baroness Ashton, ladies and gentlemen, the presidential elections in Russia on 4 March will show whether the government in Moscow has learnt its lesson. They will make it clear whether the processes have been improved and whether we can hold out hope that there will be positive developments in this area. However, the many demonstrations that have taken place since the beginning of December make me very hopeful. They are an indication that civil society is gaining strength and, therefore, for me they are also a sign of hope. At the same time, the large-scale demonstration due to take place on Saturday also highlights the problem faced by the Russian opposition and the protest movement. The so-called systemic opposition parties, which are represented in the Duma, are to a large extent not regarded by the population as being a viable democratic alternative. The inclusion of the nationalists in the protest movement is, thank goodness, giving rise to heated debate. I believe that we need to show solidarity in particular with those who have joined the White Ring protest over recent days and weeks. These citizens come from a wide range of different areas of society and are taking action to protect their civil rights, without having an ideological axe to grind and, most importantly, without any kind of self-interest. They do not want to form a government. Instead, they want the right to freely elect a government. This makes the movement even more convincing. What Russia most urgently needs are state institutions and elected officials who have democratic legitimacy and the trust of their voters and who make a clear commitment to serving the interests of the voters and to combating corruption and other abuses of power. Therefore, we must give this movement our support now and make it increasingly clear in our discussions with our Russian partners that we are happy to cooperate with them, but that we also want to see joint progress being made towards more democracy. Those of us who are members of the EU-Russia delegation will definitely be discussing this when we visit Moscow in eight weeks and it would be good if the Commission could play an active role in supporting the delegation.

 Madam President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, I would like to start by offering my sincere thanks to the shadow rapporteurs for their very open, excellent collaboration. It was not too difficult in this case, as we are all convinced of the good and very efficient work that the European Maritime Safety Agency (EMSA) has done in the last few years. There quickly emerged a relatively homogeneous picture of what we envisage the future work of this agency to be. We also all agreed that any kind of extension of competences must either have European added value or generate clear synergy effects in the Member States. Allow me to mention just a few aspects. On 20 April 2010, we experienced the worst oil disaster in human history in the Gulf of Mexico. On 10 August 2011, there was the oil spill at the Gannet Alpha platform in the North Sea. The report on oil pollution by the Oslo-Paris Commission reveals that, in 2008, there were more than 500 oil spills at oil and gas platforms in the North Sea. It was therefore right for the Directorate-General for Energy to table a legislative package in this regard to improve the regulation of oil platforms. This includes an independent third party who is to monitor the safety of the oil platforms. Together, we should open the door for EMSA here. What European body could perform this supervisory role better? I know that EMSA does not currently have the relevant expertise. However, that is a weak argument. There are large overlaps with the areas in which EMSA currently works, and it is considerably more efficient these days to extend the available resources rather than to create entirely new ones. If the Member States now say that they are prepared to extend EMSA’s mandate and state that EMSA is now not only responsible for shipping accidents, but is also to perform the clear up following oil spills caused by drilling rigs, this will perhaps reveal a modicum of common sense, but it will certainly not be a major breakthrough. The European Parliament must focus on preventive measures. Merely cleaning up after the event is not enough. Commissioner Oettinger said that numerous facts about accidents confirm that prevention is better than trying to put things right afterwards. This statement is perhaps not particularly helpful, but it is right nevertheless. I would like to address two more points that also seem to me to be important. We need European maritime transport without borders. We have already had many debates on this subject, but there is still too little being done and too slowly for us to achieve this objective. With the help of EMSA and its recording capabilities, we can also make progress in this area. My next point is that we all know how important it is to support maritime occupations in the European Union. We cannot and do not under any circumstances want to win the competition for the lowest personnel costs and the reduction of social standards. However, when it comes to the quality of the training and further training of the seafarers, then we can play a leading role, and EMSA can and must contribute its knowledge and expertise in this regard. In committee, the report received the support of a large majority. It is intended to make it clear that Parliament takes its proposals seriously. I am confident as regards the negotiations with the Council. However, this presupposes a serious readiness to negotiate. That is what I am asking for. Knut Fleckenstein,  
rapporteur.

 Madam President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, I would just like to thank those involved once again for their cooperation and also those who have just spoken for their contributions to the debate. There are naturally a few things that have not received adequate mention in our debate, as there has not been enough time – apprehending environmental polluters for example, and you mentioned piracy. I would just like to make one thing clear once again, Mr van Dalen. This report does not call for a European coastguard. We are, however, asking to finally receive the expert opinion that we want – as decided by this Parliament a long time ago – on how this coastguard should be structured and what advantages and disadvantages it would have. Mr Gallagher mentioned that EMSA saves the Member States a lot of money. That is correct. Now the issue of a coastguard could be seen as an example of the fact that we will only really have these synergy effects if we do not merely set something up jointly but if, back in our Member States, we also remember what was decided in Brussels and reduce the national structures accordingly. Only then will we see the synergy effects. Where one or two transport ministers are concerned, I have the impression that they join in the decision-making process in Brussels but then forget to tell anyone back home that adjustments need to be made as a result. I am a German MEP so I know what I am talking about. Of course, we could not regulate everything. The gender issue is something we are taking seriously. Nevertheless, it is obviously difficult to regulate the gender issue in a satisfactory way in bodies to which 27 Member States each send one person. As regards competences – whether national or regional – we sometimes had the feeling in committee that this was a Spanish domestic discussion. It is all the same to me whether it is national or regional. The authorities must be the competent authorities, and that is what will make them the right points of contact. How the competence is determined is up to others at a local level. My final point is that EMSA contains an ‘S’ for ‘safety’, you are absolutely right about that. However, Ms Foster, if you believe that as far as oil platforms are concerned, there are particularly good regulations in place, then I would remind you once again of what I said earlier: 500 accidents on oil and gas drilling rigs in 2008 show that we really need to consider how we can improve this situation and perhaps also integrate this within an agency that already deals with similar problems. Knut Fleckenstein  (S&amp;D

 Madam President, Baroness Ashton, I can only endorse what Ms Oomen-Ruijten has said about the elections. We very much want to make it clear to the Russian President that his announcements must be followed by actions and that we will take him exactly at his word. I think that what Mr Swoboda has said is right. We should hold a major hearing for everyone involved, once the OSCE Office for Democratic Institutions and Human Rights (ODIHR) has submitted its report. Therefore, I think it is wrong to call for new elections now, before the report is available. I would just like to say one thing to Mr Kelam, but unfortunately he is no longer here. Perhaps it is simply an error in the interpreting. He said that the demonstrators in Moscow represent an opportunity for us. I do not believe that this is right. It is not an opportunity for us, but an opportunity for the people of Russia. We need to be careful about what we say. Elections will be an important topic of conversation at the summit, but this can also be a summit which gives confidence. There are two positive points which I would like to mention briefly. One is accession to the World Trade Organisation (WTO) after 18 years of negotiations. This not only clarifies the rules, but could also make a new agreement with us easier, hopefully in future prevent the unilateral trade restrictions that there have been in the past, and alleviate the repeated pressure caused by the Siberian overflight rights. The second and final point that I want to touch on briefly is the question of visas and free movement. We are pleased that a regulation will be put in place on the border traffic to and from Kaliningrad. That will really make the situation easier for people in Poland and in Kaliningrad in particular. The joint steps which the two countries aim to agree on and which have been carefully prepared will hopefully, with good will on both sides, lead to a regulation on visa-free travel at some point. We will be discussing modernisation, human rights and the development of a civil society and we want to achieve sensible, positive results. However, without personal contacts, none of this will succeed. Knut Fleckenstein,  
on behalf of the S&amp;D Group.

 Mr President, Baroness Ashton, ladies and gentlemen, I shall be brief, because the subject of Russia comes round every four weeks and I stand by the opinion that I expressed four weeks ago. Yes, we regret the fact that yet again, parties in Russia, most recently the liberal party, are not approved and therefore cannot stand for public election. I am convinced that no nation in the world will put up with this in the long term. I am also convinced that our Partnership for Modernisation could be implemented much more effectively if the Russian Government could allay concerns about democratic shortcomings and the rule of law with bold decisions. Until such time as that happens, we shall not let this subject rest, also because we believe that it is in the interest of our partner, in other words, Russia itself. For my part, I should also like to add that I am equally convinced that we can achieve a great deal more by stepping up our talks and our cooperation than by adopting monthly resolutions, however appropriate these may be. Human rights and democracy are indivisible. Our public contribution to this is important, our criticism of Russia is justified, but we would be even more credible if we were to identify the shortcomings within the EU with the same honesty and acuity and perhaps even more unanimously than before. As long as Members of this House maintain – as they did yesterday – that modern Hungary is a model democracy, then, what my fellow Member from the European People’s Party (Christian Democrats) said continues to apply: that the self-righteousness of some Members of this House is hair-raising. I agree with that. I am not saying this to please anyone in Moscow, but because I am firmly convinced that we can make a much more effective contribution than we are making at present. (The speaker agreed to take a blue-card question under Rule 149(8)) Knut Fleckenstein  (S&amp;D
). 
 – (DE)
 Mr Migalski, you are absolutely right. The two things cannot be compared. However, I believe that you enhance your credibility by dealing with the problems in your own backyard – quite irrespective of any criticism, including of Moscow. My second point is that, while we are perfectly entitled to criticise Moscow, the question must be how we can most effectively help bring about some kind of change. I am convinced that that will not be achieved through repeated resolutions. Knut Fleckenstein  (S&amp;D
). 
 – (DE)
 Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I would just like to mention two points because Mr Swoboda has already mentioned a number of points on behalf of our group. Russia is indeed at an important crossroads. Its internal political situation will be determined by the elections to the Duma in December and the question of who will continue the modernisation embarked upon as president from 2012. One can also put a positive slant on this. There could be no better opportunity to strengthen international confidence in Russia’s development. This is conditional upon there being fair elections, fair opportunities for registration and access to the media for the candidates, to ensure at least an element of equal opportunity. My second point concerns the Partnership for Modernisation between the EU and Russia. This opens up new opportunities for effective cooperation. We should therefore not miss the opportunity to support Russia vigorously in this modernisation – not just by investing in the modernisation of the economy, but also in its society. Governments put things down on paper and, as we all know, you can say what you like on paper. Citizens, however, become very restless if what is stated on paper is not implemented. Civil participation and the involvement of civil society, entrepreneurs, researchers, young people and artists are essential to a self-determined society of solidarity. We can only successfully support such modernisation, however, if people can come together easily in order to learn from each other and exchange experiences. For these reasons, the EU and Russia should finally reach agreement on the common steps that need to be taken to achieve visa-free travel and how these can be implemented, in order to achieve results as quickly as possible. We have been talking about people in the Kaliningrad region and thinking about facilitation. A month ago, this House decided that visa facilitation should be allowed for cultural purposes. We have been talking about whether perhaps particular consideration should be given to young people here. These are all good suggestions to get the ball rolling, but they are no substitute for an overall solution. I would therefore urge the Commission to step up the pace. You can count on our support in any case, including as regards some of the more hesitant certain Member States. (Applause) Knut Fleckenstein  (S&amp;D
). 
 – (DE)
 Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, through its report on the cultural dimensions of the EU’s external actions, Parliament clarifies its aspiration to also put our own stamps on this developing policy field. The fact – and I want to put this carefully – that I do not see a representative of the External Action Service here today shows how necessary this report is. The report quite rightly urges that, in future, cultural aspects should play a more significant role in external policy, into which they should be more systematically incorporated. For my group, it was important to call for a coherent strategy that more effectively coordinates existing EU external policy programmes with cultural components, thereby taking account of cultural diversity in the EU. Mrs Pack has already made reference to this, saying that the existing structures in the Member States and between them, such as the EUNIC network of national institutes for culture, must be incorporated and that civil society must be seen as part of European external cultural policy. The EU’s motto of ‘United in diversity’ should also come to bear on the image that the Union projects to the outside world. We should also make even better use of the new media as a communications platform to that end. As we do all this, we need to make sure that art and culture do not become means to an end in external policy. It is our cultural values that characterise our European Community. It is therefore important and right that this cultural diversity and identity should also be disseminated outside the Union by its policies. I feel sure that we can achieve much more in this way, including in the debate about human rights and democracy, than through many cases of sabre-rattling, sometimes with absolutely nothing to back it up, in this House. Knut Fleckenstein  (S&amp;D
). 
 – (DE)
 Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I regret the fact that this debate was put on the agenda at such short notice that the High Representative for Foreign Affairs and Security Policy was not able to be here. In recent months, Baroness Ashton has worked with the Council to improve internal EU coordination on cooperation with our strategic partners, including Russia. With regard to her efforts to achieve a coordinated position, I think it would have been sensible to involve her in this debate. None of the other strategic partners of the EU is as close to us as Russia, either geographically or in relation to our historic experiences. This is why we take great interest in the internal political developments in Russia. At this point, I would like to make specific mention of the work programme drawn up jointly by the coordinators of the Partnership for Modernisation, both in Russia and in the EU. This joint work programme for modernisation contains important measures which will provide active support for the development of the rule of law in Russia. This is the right way of ensuring that our partnership brings real benefits, in particular, for the citizens. The initiative to modernise Russia launched by the Russian President gives the country’s international partners the opportunity to begin a fruitful cooperation with Russia. We must make use of this opportunity. As my fellow Members have already said, if the modernisation process is to be sustainable, it must not only be based on technological developments. A modern Russian economy must be founded on the reliable principles of the rule of law. Only when citizens and business people can rely on the rule of law will they have the courage to introduce innovations and make investments. Let us take the hand that Russia has reached out to us and help the country to modernise. Knut Fleckenstein  (S&amp;D
).

– Madam President, I will vote for the resolution, yes. Knut Fleckenstein  (S&amp;D
). 
 – (DE)
 Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I would simply like to make three brief points, on behalf also of some of my colleagues on the Committee on Transport and Tourism. These are critical points that I would ask the representatives of the Commission to bring up in their discussions. The first is that although it has already been passed, the travel promotion tax is an unacceptable unilateral decision by the US Government. We hope that you can persuade it to think again on this. Secondly, the exclusion of Romania, Poland, Bulgaria and Cyprus from the visa waiver programme is something that the European Parliament cannot endorse, and, in our opinion, it should not be allowed to continue. Thirdly, we welcome the joint efforts to elaborate international security standards and to develop smart security concepts, but unilateral stipulations such as compulsory container scanning are not a solution because they are one-sided and disproportionate. The costs are out of all proportion to the benefit and it is unreasonable to expect this of European ports and enterprises. Knut Fleckenstein,  
on behalf of the S&amp;D Group

 Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, firstly I would like to congratulate Mrs Meissner on her report and thank her for all her hard work. We share the approach taken by this report which puts the focus not on the sectoral structure of maritime policy in the individual Member States, but instead emphasises the importance of coordinating maritime policy within and across the Member States. If we look to the future, we will see the space available in our seas and oceans becoming more restricted. The oceans are transport routes, sources of raw materials and energy, suppliers of foodstuffs and water reservoirs. The economic exploitation of the oceans is growing and this brings an accompanying increase in the environmental impact on them. Conflicts of interest will arise and we will have to resolve them by means of effective coordination within and among countries. It is not possible to comment on every issue, but I would like to mention briefly the sulphur emission control areas. It was not my intention to make the limits less strict. When the Commission presents its study, we will be able to tell to what extent the limits will result in a shift from sea to road transport, in particular in the North Sea and the Baltic. Then we can discuss this issue further. However, the basic conditions for competition within the European Union between the North and the South must remain at the same level. This must also be one of the Commission’s objectives. There is one point which we are not entirely happy about. We have been talking for a long time about the strategic importance of the shipbuilding industry in Europe. We have also said that innovation is very important in this industry, because this is the only way that it can survive. We need a coordinated strategy for our policy on the shipbuilding industry. I believe that the call from the Member States to put funding aside for shipbuilding was also very important, but it has not been supported by the Liberals and the Conservatives. Ladies and gentlemen, how do you propose that we should support the shipbuilding industry in Europe? Coming out with platitudes and good wishes for the workers in the European shipyards, who are concerned about their jobs, is simply not enough. We Social Democrats expect better measures and better proposals in this area. Knut Fleckenstein  (S&amp;D
). 
 – (DE)
 Mr President, I would just like to interrupt the debate very briefly to inform you and my fellow Members that last night, three terrorists stormed the Chechen Parliament, killing several security officers and taking hostages. The terrorists were also killed. Parliament ought to express its condemnation of this act of terrorism in no uncertain terms, because terrorism can never be justified. Our sympathy goes out to the families. I wanted to mention this briefly, especially in view of the fact that we will be discussing the Northern Caucasus again this week. I apologise for the interruption. Knut Fleckenstein  (S&amp;D
). 
 – (DE)
 Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I am pleased that we will be able to adopt this report with a large majority tomorrow. There are two things that I regard as being particularly important. The first is ensuring that the objectives we have set ourselves for 2020 can be measured. We need measurable principles which will allow us to take stock after ten years or, even better, halfway through the period, so that we can identify whether we have achieved some of what we set out to do or whether things have not worked out and we need to make improvements. This applies in particular to CO2
 emissions in the transport sector. If all the other sectors are making good progress, as Mr Cramer has said, then we can rightly call on the transport industry to do the same. European transport policy is of particular importance when it comes to reducing CO2
 emissions. The second point concerns the implementation of efficient comodality. For me, this is the key to a sensible EU transport strategy. I say this, because efficient comodality can have a number of different meanings. If we do not base this theoretical concept on the right criteria, which can be put into practice, we will not achieve our objective. Therefore, I am once again calling on the Commission to ensure that the concept is implemented correctly down to the last detail, which means developing useful intermodal nodes and removing the bottlenecks in the transport of goods to and from important European trade gateways. This particularly applies to the links between major ports and airports and their hinterlands. My third point is that the proposed core Trans-European Network (TEN) must be based on the same criteria, so that there is an almost automatic modal shift towards an efficient and environmentally friendly European transport system. These are the factors that make up a sensible plan. Not just cost effectiveness, but also social compatibility, environmental protection and sustainability. Mr Grosch and Mrs Alvarez, thank you very much for all your hard work. Knut Fleckenstein  (S&amp;D
). 
 – (DE)
 Madam President, Baroness Ashton, ladies and gentlemen, the EU-Russia Summit has produced reasonable results, in particular, as far as specifying the details of the Partnership for Modernisation is concerned. I very much welcome the fact that dialogue between the civil societies has been seen as a priority in this partnership. As the chair of the European Parliament delegation for relations with Russia, I led a working group meeting in Perm a few days ago specifically on the subject of developing the civil society. We have once again seen how much progress has been made in Russia in recent years, but also how much still remains to be done and how much we can contribute to the discussions on the basis of our experiences, both good and otherwise. Exchange and movement are key concepts for me. There can be no Partnership for Modernisation without the movement of people. For this reason, I am rather disappointed that the EU has not really made much progress in the area of travel without visas. We must now set specific objectives which the EU and Russia can work together to achieve. This is not about meeting schedules and certainly not about following certain sequences of events. It is all about ensuring that we take a predictable approach to these issues, that the criteria are clearly defined and that everyone, including Russia, can be sure that when these conditions are fulfilled and when the specific problems are solved, visa liberalisation will be possible. Knut Fleckenstein,  
on behalf of the S&amp;D Group.

 Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, first of all, we very much welcome the fact that, in future, we will have a maritime strategy in the EU, even if we will have to wait a little longer for the vote. We assume that this report will be incorporated into the Future of Transport report and then into the White Paper. Through the European Maritime Transport Strategy 2018, we are creating the framework to make the European maritime economy more competitive at international level, and in this strategy we have determined, firstly, that we want this framework to be set up on the basis of ecological standards and, secondly, that we want sensible global social standards for high quality shipping. Let me briefly address three points. Firstly, shipping is an environmentally friendly transport sector and therefore, one of our aims was for this branch of the economy to play its part in combating climate change in future, too. I am very much in favour of us creating incentives like the green ports, even if we do not make any decisions today but rather assign the Commission and the Council the task of finding out what is possible in this regard. I believe it is just as important to maintain international competitiveness – including in respect of other modes of transport. It is therefore also right for the Commission, on the basis of our proposal, to once again carry out an impact assessment in respect of the sulphur emission control areas in the North Sea and the Baltic Sea because, if we want higher requirements here than elsewhere, we need to take international competition into account and ensure that, if possible, we do not cause the transport of containers to move back to the roads, which would be counterproductive. Allow me to mention one last thing that I feel is particularly important, namely the inclusion of the major European ports in the planning of the TEN networks. This is of such enormous importance to us because the ports are important intersections in the transport chains and they can only perform their role effectively if intermodality is facilitated and reinforced. There are numerous other points that I could mention here. Mr van Dalen, congratulations on this excellent report. We have all contributed a little to it and I would ask for your understanding for the fact that we do not want to spoil this excellent report by accepting your amendments. Knut Fleckenstein  (S&amp;D
). 
 – (DE)
 Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, the previous speakers have already clearly highlighted many points and problems, such as the human rights situation. It is important for us to make these points clearly, as only then will we be able to have an open and frank debate. If Russia is currently once again seriously discussing introducing the death penalty according to the US model, we cannot neglect to express our opinion on this. I have two brief points to make. My first point relates to Russia’s accession to the WTO and my sincere request, including to the Council and the Commission, is to provide as much support as possible for this. Of course, Russia must play its part, too, but we are both relying on this and it would be good for both of us if developments in this regard were to move in a positive direction. The fact that Russia wants to join the WTO and not just enter into a customs union with Belarus and Kazakhstan is a step in the right direction. My second point is a sincere request for us not to lose sight of the development of our cooperation in the areas of science and research as well as in the area of civil society. We need a new impetus for cultural exchange as well as youth exchanges, not only in one direction, as Mr Gahler said, but in both directions. Every young person who takes part in this will develop an understanding for others and will become a messenger for a more positive development of our relations. I hope that we will talk more about these common interests and that these aspects will also assume greater importance. Matthias Groote,  
rapporteur.

Mr President, Commissioner, President-in-Office of the Council, ladies and gentlemen, it is a well-established and fine tradition that we adopt a joint resolution in advance of climate conferences and prepare the delegation. Yesterday, we held a final meeting which was attended by the Commissioner and also the President of this House. My colleagues with experience in these matters tell me this was a first! With his contribution, the President sent out a strong signal that the full backing of the House is ensured and that we are taking on an important role in relation to COP 18, in that we will be holding discussions with as many international representatives as possible there and will also exercising our powers of persuasion. That really is essential. We hope that after tomorrow, we will be able to take with us a strong resolution that offers clear solutions. We have a duty to provide answers, for climate change can only be combated and halted through international cooperation. The conference in Doha will take place from 26 November to 7 December, and I am keen to see which positions China will adopt and which positions the US will adopt now that the President has been returned to office for a second term. How will they position themselves, and how will we then respond to the issues raised, and so on?  We have just held an interesting debate about Europe’s financial future. This debate is relevant to us in Doha as well, for as is well-known, friendship stops where money begins. Where climate change is concerned, however, friendship begins in earnest. We must find answers to the question of how the fast-start period will continue to be financed after 2012. A great deal of money will be required here. However, it is important to emphasise, as always, that the deceptive aspect of climate change is that its effects are not felt immediately. Even if we were to adopt a decision tomorrow that CO2
 emissions will be reduced by 50 % immediately, the effects would not be felt until very much later. Climate change and the financial crisis therefore have one feature in common: they will both cost a great deal of money.  If we continue to prevaricate, also in the international arena, and do not manage to find a workable way forward in Doha, this will prove very costly for the international community and is likely to have extremely adverse effects for a great many people. It may even cost lives. Failure, therefore, is not an option. However, we should not demand too much, that much is clear. At previous conferences, we learned that we have to take small steps. However, the largest step that the industrialised nations must take is to deal with the future financing and safeguards for adaptation measures and climate action. Clearly, we remain committed to the 2° target. However, with a ‘business as usual’ approach, 3.5° or 4° is the more likely outcome, and no expert in the world can tell us the exact number of degrees at which we cause irreparable damage to the planet.  I am most grateful to the Commissioner. Last week, we held a lengthy debate on how we wish to proceed internally with our emissions trading scheme. However, there is movement at the international level as well, and this applies to various sectors. I welcome the fact that we appear to be on track, here in the EP, towards a solution for aviation, which I hope will be achieved as quickly as possible, ideally before the conference. However, aviation is an international business, and if there is the possibility of achieving a global agreement here, we should stop the clock, as the Commissioner has rightly pointed out, but of course only for a short time. In that case, it is essential to ensure that the international negotiations produce a genuinely workable arrangement, with a workable decision being taken by the International Civil Aviation Organisation (ICAO), resulting in an international agreement. Otherwise, the clocks will start ticking again in autumn next year and the legislation will proceed. I would also like to respond to the fellow Members who described this as ‘giving way’. Let me say this: ‘giving way’ looks very different. I believe this was a wise decision which this House should support. I believe it sends out a signal for the debates in Doha and shows, once again, that we are willing to compromise here. A further important point relates to climate diplomacy, which the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Food Safety included in the resolution. This means that we are following this issue at all levels, including the European External Action Service (EEAS), and it is always a topic of discussion at all the international meetings. The parliamentary delegation is very well prepared. I very much hope that everyone, including the Commission, will ensure that the parliamentary delegation is fully involved in all the daily briefings so that we have a lively exchange. Our role in Doha will be to convince as many people as possible in positions of responsibility outside the European Union that our ideas are the right ones, and advocate for a global agreement, so that a second commitment period can begin. That is crucial in order to combat climate change and achieve successes. Matthias Groote  (S&amp;D

Mr President, the timing of today’s session leaves something to be desired. I have never experienced us being over an hour late before. In this regard, blue cards should indeed be used freely, but should also not be misused.  With regard to fracking, the debate reminds me a little of that relating to nuclear power – yes or no. I must say, however, that just because something is technically possible, that does not mean it has to be done. The protection of health and the environment must therefore take absolute priority over any immature technologies, and that is what I see when it comes to fracking. My greatest reservations concern the impact on the environment. What we are lacking is a sensible regulatory framework. We have various policy areas: Member States are responsible for the energy mix, but we are responsible for environmental policy. We have gaps in the water framework legislation. We have no mining law. I believe it is appropriate and timely for the Commission to think about how we can close these gaps, to create legal certainty and to ensure maximum protection for health and the environment. This – as I see it, anyway – is not the case with regard to fracking! A potential energy supply of the future cannot, however, be created at the cost of the environment or health. Furthermore, if you look at how many accidents and risks there are in the United States with the 50 000 existing well-bores, I must say that we should give careful consideration to how we get involved in this technology and what the protective framework for this future technology should be. Matthias Groote  (S&amp;D

Mr President, last Wednesday, the Nordseewerke shipyard in Emden had to file for bankruptcy because, to its surprise, a guarantee by the Lower Saxon Land Government was not extended. That undertaking, with 700 skilled jobs, is in the process of transforming from a shipyard to a supplier of offshore wind energy. And it is now thought that this undertaking can be saved by a large loan and that the jobs can also be saved, for the 700 SIAG and Nordseewerke workers have already had to accept substantial cuts in their pay. That is why I ask the Commission to take a favourable and also an early look at this procedure, to ensure that these 700 jobs are not put at risk, because they are needed in order to organise the energy revolution and sustainable energy on the seas of Europe. Please do not let the workers there suffer from the Land government’s poor crisis management. Matthias Groote  (S&amp;D

 Mr President, air quality is an important topic in the European Union, particularly in the coming year, which is the Year of Air. We should take heed of this and work to ensure that progress is made in this area. However, we also have to take into account the fact that maritime transport is currently facing one of its most severe crises. I have major concerns regarding the technology that is to be used to provide clean air. In this area, we must make sure – and that includes in the financial perspective – that alternatives are pointed out. As my fellow Member has just said, LNG is a very good alternative in the Sulphur Emission Control Areas (SECAs). However, for this we need research and development. It is also an economic recovery plan for our shipyards, particularly in the case of scrubber technology, which has not got that far yet. I sometimes get the feeling that some of my fellow Members believe that the required technology is just sitting on the shelf waiting to be used. It is not. I would therefore like to see greater focus on promoting technology, so that we really can have clean air in our ports and port cities. Please would you also pay heed to who foots the bill at the end of the day. Matthias Groote  (S&amp;D

 Mr President, the best kind of energy is energy that is not used in the first place. We are not talking here about saving energy, but about using energy more efficiently. There is one aspect of this where I would like us to have gone further, and that is in the public sector. There is huge potential here, a huge backlog of investments among our local authorities. I would have liked to have seen Parliament being more ambitious in this regard. We have pushed through this procedure, partly unnecessarily. One Member – one of the shadow rapporteurs – has mentioned it already; I even thought he wanted to vote against the whole compromise. If it is all so terrible, why did he then not push for a second reading? I would have liked the community to take such an important matter to second reading, so that the whole package could be discussed with the chambers and guilds. Greater transparency in this area would really have done us good. That is what I would like to see happen next time. The rapporteurs have made their decision, but I would like to remind Members that two readings are actually the rule in this House. In this parliamentary term, it has become the exception. We should take that to heart and think about it sometime. Matthias Groote  (S&amp;D

 Mr President, we debated the preparations for the Rio+20 conference intensively in our respective bodies within the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Food Safety. It must be said however, that, in the final analysis, the result achieved in Rio is fairly unimpressive. Mr Prodi expressed our disappointment in a nutshell, calling it Rio minus 20! Some NGOs described the result the same way. What has been achieved in the conference is really very little indeed. Firstly, we need to consider whether there is much point holding conferences in this format. We have been through Copenhagen, which was a disaster, and now we have had Rio+20: we are moving from one disappointment to the next. I think that the upgrading of the UN Environment Programme, putting it on an almost equal footing with the WHO, is the right approach, as it will give this organisation more authority and more enforcement powers than was previously the case. This is a very important point. We are going to witness the world’s population grow to 9 billion. We are heading for a catastrophe if things keep going like this. If more and more people live in industrialised nations and want access to energy and if we do not take radical steps to avert this, we shall encounter enormous problems. That is why we need a new development strategy. There has been no public debate on this issue, even in advance of Rio. When I consider what we voted on yesterday – ACTA – and the number of e-mails and letters, etc. we received on this issue, then I believe that we also need to move towards a sustainable planet in the digital community too. After all, this world is the only one we have got. We can play our part here by changing our strategy and bringing more people along with us, and then perhaps the Angela Merkels of this world will travel to the next summit and really put their heads together to produce concrete results.

Mr President, I would also like to express my sincere thanks to the shadow rapporteurs and the rapporteur. This report was adopted by the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Food Safety with an absolute majority of 62 votes in favour, no votes against and no abstentions. This shows that we are actually very much at one with regard to the compromises. Of course, we must give the greatest priority in this legislative process to the provision of high level consumer protection for the younger members of society, in other words children, who need special consideration. Gluten intolerance is a problem, particularly in nurseries. If we look around us – I myself have two children in this age group – we will be aware of the allergies and intolerances that arise, which is why I believe that we have chosen the right approach. We should continue to discuss this in the second reading, also involving the Council and Commission. I believe that we will then also achieve positive results. Matthias Groote  (S&amp;D

 Mr President, Seveso, Enschede, Toulouse – these places are synonymous with major disasters that result not just in environmental disaster, but also in loss of life and the destruction of private property. That is why we must do everything we can to reduce the risk, as well as the likelihood, of such accidents being repeated. How do we do that? Firstly, we must allow even unscheduled inspections, and it must not be simply routine. The people who live close to such industrial establishments must be very well informed of what is going on there, what happens there. In the event of an incident, we must make sure that the situation is clarified promptly. This is very important, because it can save human lives. I think the Council has not done itself any favours here. I also think the Council should be here for this debate in Parliament. Apparently, however, other things are more important. I think the Council might have saved face if it had explained why this legislation has been watered down. That is what I would have liked to see. However, strong legislation in this area will also create confidence. This confidence is needed when the Member States plan large infrastructure projects. At such times, there are always major reservations among the population. Strong legislation here, such as we have achieved today, creates confidence; and that is only possible where there is the greatest possible degree of transparency. It also requires authorities to be better networked with each other, to cooperate more with each other; we also need more communication, and dealing with such large, dangerous establishments must never become routine. We must not allow that to happen. Matthias Groote  (S&amp;D

Blue-card question
. – (DE)
 A blue card, because we have now heard a great many critical voices. I know that Mr Seeber has dealt with the procedure in Parliament very well, having taken this over from János Áder. My question is simply: we are now concluding this at first reading, as we do for as much as 65% of our environmental legislation. My question to the rapporteur is whether we might not perhaps have been able to achieve greater transparency, even though the Council took a blocking attitude, if we had taken it to a second reading? This is a fundamental issue. Richard, I realise that you took this over. However, I would like to hear the current rapporteur’s view on this. Matthias Groote  (S&amp;D
). 
 – (DE)
 Mr President, Commissioner, rapporteur, shadow rapporteur, the spirit is willing, but the flesh is weak. That is what you could say about resource conservation. Everyone wants to move in the right direction, but how do we get there? Voluntary measures – as we have seen time and time again, in the automotive industry, in other areas – have been a resounding failure. Resource efficiency and the conservation of resources are an element of foreign policy, security policy, health policy, environmental policy, economic policy, agricultural policy – they affect all areas. Looking at the empty Council benches, I can only say that I am astonished that the Council is not here today, but perhaps things will take a bit longer, because they are missing something today – namely, the presentation and debate on a very, very good report by Mr Gerbrandy. This topic is by no means dealt with yet, and this matter will decide whether Europe lives in prosperity in future and what our environment in Europe will look like. It is now a matter of finding the instruments. The internalisation of external costs – there is no way around it: this principle must be introduced. Anyone who pollutes water or air must pay for it. At the moment, we pay for it via our health insurance or through other areas – we are paying for it with our taxes, Ms Gardini. This has to be internalised, and here we need to be courageous for once, because only then will we deal with the future challenges that we face. A growing world population – not in Europe, we will get smaller in the future – is a huge challenge, and therefore this report that Mr Gerbrandy has produced is a good starting point for considering new political strategies, and that applies to the Commission, too. We have to think in terms of life cycles – instead of simply regulating what comes out of the exhaust, we also need to look at the factory where the car is manufactured. Is that sustainable, does it conserve resources? We must think in terms of complete cycles and be courageous about this and not stick with the status quo
 – because if we do, we will pay very, very dearly for it. (Applause) Matthias Groote  (S&amp;D

Madam President, firstly, I would like to congratulate Mr Gerbrandy. This is a very good report and it gives us guidelines as to how we should act in forthcoming legislative procedures and during major reform processes. The litmus test will come when we discuss agricultural reform. Many of the speeches today have already made this clear. This is where we will have the opportunity to do more to promote biodiversity and to show our other partners, for example, at the Rio+20 conference, that we take this subject seriously. The Heads of State or Government agreed in 2001 that biodiversity must be protected. Unfortunately, we have failed to achieve this objective. The window of opportunity is gradually closing and it is time for us to act. The problem will not be resolved solely by this strategy. The whole issue must be incorporated into the reform of fisheries and agriculture policy and given a more concrete form. Matthias Groote  (S&amp;D
).  
– (DE)
 Mr President, it is important that resource efficiency is also included in the 7th Environment Action Programme (EAP), which is what we have been discussing today. I hope that we will vote in plenary in the same way as we voted in the committee and that the Rio+20 conference will be a great success. Following the discussions with the environment ministers this week, I am in a very positive mood. We should design the 7th EAP accordingly and include the concrete decisions which we hope will be made in Rio, in other words, the international dimension. As far as doing business sustainably is concerned, we need to introduce an end-to-end approach, for example, in car manufacturing. We must consider the car from production right through to recycling. To achieve this, we need a legislative framework. The 7th EAP is a good location for this framework, which can then be applied when the relevant legislation is revised. Matthias Groote  (S&amp;D
).

 Mr President, we are discussing the changeover to a low-emissions economy. We have heard a number of people today tell us that we should continue as before. Mr Davies’ report contains an important point: if we continue as before, this will cost 5% of gross domestic product in the future. A full 5% of gross domestic product if we continue as before! Accordingly, the contents of the report represent a start. Naturally we are only responsible for 12% of emissions. However, if someone does not make a start, no one will. There will be a battle for resources and the lower our emissions in the future, the fewer raw materials we will consume. There will also be a radical economic impact if we fail to take evasive action, investing in renewable energies and reducing emissions from traffic. We have made a start here. This is a difficult path, both within the EU and internationally, which is why we need more diplomatic activity around climate issues. The European External Action Service needs to play its part in ensuring more is done with regard to climate-related diplomacy. We resolved here to include aviation in the Emissions Trading System. At present this is encountering international resistance – to put things diplomatically. Nonetheless, we are on the right track. If the US, Russia and India develop a similar system, then we will of course be willing to cooperate with them and to show them the hand of friendship. Nonetheless, someone has to make a start. That is what we have done. It will also be evident in economic terms that we made a start in good time. This is a good report and everyone in the Chamber today bears some responsibility in making this report a success. We cannot afford for the report to fail, like its predecessor, the Eickhout report. That would be a completely destructive signal to the citizens of Europe and the world’s public at large. Hence my call to all my fellow Members: each of us must move a little from our positions if this report is to be a success. Matthias Groote,

 Mr President, I am grateful to the Commissioner for the opportunity to debate this important topic today. In my country, Germany, 900 holdings are affected by the Schmallenberg virus and the numbers are growing. Naturally there are also signs of fear in the public debate in relation to the agricultural sector, ranging from loss of income to complete loss of livelihood, as well as public health concerns. After all, it is not possible to offer a 100% guarantee that this virus will not affect humans. The European Food Safety Authority has already announced that it wishes to work closely with the European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control in order to keep a close eye on the impact on public health. I believe that this is very important. A monitoring procedure does exist and has been simulated once by EFSA. We have just heard that eight Member States have been affected by this disease so far, and our fears are that the outbreak will spread as the flying insect population increases in spring and summer. A number of different scenarios have been identified. Can the Commission indicate precisely what steps it will take to combat the situations revealed in the simulation? Perhaps you are still at the analysis stage? This is a very important point. It is also important that the general public should see that steps are being taken to control this disease. I am aware that this is something new, and that we do not have specific means for combating this disease. Nonetheless, I would ask what steps is the Commission planning, or has it already taken to ensure that this disease does not spread to all 27 Member States? Eight countries are affected so far and we do not want to see the disease spread to all 27 Member States. Matthias Groote  (S&amp;D

 Madam President, Mr Duff has presented us with a visionary and – as he said himself – radical proposal for the reform of the electoral system. I believe that that is a good thing; we need proposals and we need more Europe in European politics. However, the reality currently looks rather different: 18 fellow Members are still waiting to be able to come here to Parliament and we are already talking about expanding Parliament by another 25 Members. I think it is good that this report, most of which I support, will be debated once again in the Committee on Constitutional Affairs and that we will then adopt this Duff report here with a broad majority the third time around, because we need a uniform electoral system. I would like to share many of Mr Duff’s visions with him. Hopefully, we will adopt the final report in the second half of this year and then also implement it. However, I believe that we need a broad majority, not just a slight majority, because then we will really make ourselves heard with this proposal. Matthias Groote,

 Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, firstly I would like to thank the rapporteur and all those involved in this process because tomorrow, after the vote, a long period of hard work will finally come to a conclusion. This is a good day for Europe, for the European Parliament as an institution, and for the Commission because we have succeeded in getting a common transparency register off the ground. This an important step along the way, but more work needs to be done. I would like to address two points. The first is that the register is not really mandatory. This needs to be stated openly at this point. I have a question for the Commissioner in this regard: the Commission has always claimed that the appropriate legal framework for this does not exist. Is the Commission ready to establish such a legal framework, so that we will have a mandatory register after the revision? I was very pleased by the statement from the Council indicating that it does not foresee any difficulty in joining our register, as Mr Weber has just pointed out. I am hopeful that the Council will follow through on this, because the register will really only be complete if all three institutions of the European Union have a common register and if this register is also mandatory. As a group, we favour the amendment brought forward by another group requiring that the money spent on lobbying should also be listed in the transparency register; we intend supporting this amendment. As far as the various national lobby groups are concerned, it has been clearly stated that these will not be included in the register. I would like to thank all my fellow Members for their willingness to compromise on this matter. It really would have been a black mark for such an agreement if national lobby groups were treated in the same way as industry lobbyists or other professional associations. Matthias Groote  (S&amp;D

Madam President, I would like to thank Mr Duff for bringing up the issue of the legislative footprint. Do you believe that a legislative footprint, the extent of which still has to be defined, might also restrict the work of the European Parliament? Also: how far-reaching do you expect the impact of the legislative footprint to be? Matthias Groote,  
on behalf of the S&amp;D Group.
 – (DE)
 Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I would like to start by expressing my gratitude for the way in which we have been able to work together so constructively. We have reached a good compromise today from an environmental and an economic perspective. Even though we could, in my opinion, have gone further with regard to the limit, the legislation that we are adopting today is still the strictest in the world for light commercial vehicles. We must not forget that. Mrs Hedegaard has already said that, outside the Emissions Trading System, these small sector-specific pieces of legislation which we are introducing are very important in allowing us to achieve the goals that we have set ourselves. If vehicles use less fuel, this brings added value not only for the climate but also for air quality. With a limit of 147 grams, which is the equivalent of 5.6 litres of diesel, vehicles will produce less pollution. This means that the air quality in our cities will improve. We are taking an important step forward today. My group is voting in favour of this compromise package because it includes an important point which states that we must evaluate in 2014 at the latest whether the targets that we are adopting today have been met or exceeded and whether we need to make adjustments in this area. This was a fundamental requirement for our group. I have had long discussions with my colleague, Mr Pirillo, about the nature of this compromise and that was one of the basic prerequisites of the compromise package. Some comments have already been made about the first reading. We should make sure in future that we reach fewer first-reading agreements. In this case, it is acceptable because the negotiations ultimately only concerned 2 grams. We did not need to introduce that into the second reading. However, if we adopt everything during the first reading, Parliament will be depriving itself of its rights. There is one further point I would like to mention and that is the test cycle. It will be very important for us to have a standardised test cycle in future which will hopefully come into force throughout the world at some point and which will represent reality. Our current test cycles are not realistic and we need to make improvements in this area. International negotiations are under way and I hope that they can be brought to successful conclusion, because this will mean that the legislation will reflect the actual driving cycles. I would like to thank everyone concerned once again. Today is a good day for the European Union’s climate and environmental policy. Matthias Groote  (S&amp;D
).

Madam President, firstly I would like to thank everyone who has made this possible and, in particular, the former vice-president Sylvia-Yvonne Kaufmann, who did much of the preliminary work during the previous parliamentary term to ensure that the day would come when the European citizens’ initiative would become reality. Sometimes the citizens of the EU feel as if Europe and its institutions are very remote. This instrument, the European citizens’ initiative, will bring the institutions closer to the citizens. This is an excellent instrument which will strengthen democracy, involve people more and enable them to take the initiative. I believe that two things will be very important over the next few months. One is creating access, including digital access, to the citizens’ initiative over the Internet in a way which makes it easy to use but is also secure. The second is that if a citizens’ initiative is successful, it should be followed by a legal act. My question to the Commission is therefore as follows: How will we decide in future which initiatives will result in a legal act and which simply in a hearing? Perhaps you could explain this, Mr Šefčovič. I would also like to thank you once again for your work and for the work done by the Council. Matthias Groote  (S&amp;D

 I voted in favour of the report on the restriction of the use of certain hazardous substances in electrical and electronic equipment (RoHS), because the extension of the area of application to cover all electronic equipment represents a definite improvement. However, I find the fact that there are so many exceptions problematic. In particular in the area of renewable energies, photovoltaic modules, which consist in part of cadmium telluride compounds, are not covered by this directive. This substance is not only harmful to health, it is also hazardous and therefore really ought to be placed within the scope of the RoHS Directive. The danger that, as a result, photovoltaic installations would have to completely disappear from roofs would not arise. Rather, there are numerous cadmium telluride-free alternatives on the market. I therefore disagree in this regard with the decision of the majority in Parliament and the Council. Matthias Groote  (S&amp;D

Madam President, the democratic participation of employees in business is one of the cornerstones of social policy in the European Union. For a month now, workers at the Atlas plants in Ganderkesee, Delmenhorst and Vechta have been striking day and night for precisely these rights. Workers are fighting to secure a collective wage agreement that will enable good, secure jobs to be preserved. Unfortunately, the management has refused point blank to negotiate with the Industrial Union of Metalworkers and the works council. During the course of the industrial dispute, employees have been extremely intimidated and pressurised by management. I wish to call on the management, specifically Mr Filipov, to open discussions and to return to the negotiating table. Democratic participation cannot be allowed to stop at the factory gates. A hire-and-fire system engenders fear and sows the seeds of social unrest. There should be no place for such systems in Europe, as they are damaging to our democracy. Matthias Groote  (S&amp;D

 I voted against the Gallo report because I cannot support measures that have even remotest chance of resulting in people having their Internet access blocked or in the loss of the neutrality of the Internet. Moreover, the report makes no distinction between commercial and non-commercial file sharing, thereby criminalising private Internet users. Furthermore, the report does not contain a definition of the word ‘piracy’, which could counteract such hasty criminalisation. In contrast, the report makes recourse to demands from the very controversial ACTA agreement and to the call for the acceleration of the negotiations. I cannot support such a report.

Madam President, Commissioner, we have gathered here today at this late hour shortly before midnight to debate the subject of climate change. It is a subject that has moved into the background somewhat. We have had a financial and economic crisis – in fact, we are still in it – but nonetheless, this subject is an important one. That is also why my fellow Members have asked what line the Commission intends to take at the forthcoming ICAO negotiations. As Mr Liese has just outlined, here in Parliament, we have long grappled with reaching a compromise on the inclusion of aviation in the emissions trading system. We have conducted delicate negotiations with the Council. I feel that we also need to make this clear to the outside world – indeed internationally. As far as ICAO is concerned, and as far as reducing CO2
 emissions from aviation is concerned, my feeling is that so far, a lot of time has been invested in this, but with minimal results. We therefore need to defend our proposal on the international stage in the same way as it was defended here in Parliament, where it was adopted with a large majority. The European system will come into effect in 2012 and we have included third countries in it. That means that if an aircraft takes off in Washington and lands in the European Union, then it will fall within the emissions trading system of the European Union. Climate change is a global problem, and consequently, it is a problem that must be tackled globally. If we are serious about doing so, then we need to develop fiscal instruments. We have imposed duties on small vehicles, such as cars and lorries. Unfortunately, we are not in a position to develop uniform tax rates in Europe. I am therefore under no illusions that there is any possibility of developing an international CO2
 tax. Instead, the second best solution is therefore emissions trading, ideally globally, with rules covering third countries. These rules on third countries must also be defended tooth and nail by the European Commission and by the Council, which unfortunately, is not present at this late hour. The US is an international player. The Obama administration initially set its sights high where climate legislation is concerned. To date, however, this has not been followed up by action. The ball is now in the US’s court as regards getting climate legislation under way and harmonising and fine-tuning it internationally. This is very important. The UN climate conference in Copenhagen was a flop, as we all know. It was not crowned with success. I fear that ICAO and Annex 16 of the ICAO Agreement, which regulates environmental measures, will also be a flop. Therefore, my question to the Commission is as follows: if no agreement is reached this time regarding the inclusion of aviation in emissions trading, is the Commission actually prepared to continue negotiating at ICAO level? Is there a Plan B in this event? How will the European Commission and also the Council react in this event? Matthias Groote and Bernhard Rapkay  (S&amp;D

 The German Social Democratic (SPD) delegation in the European Parliament is in favour of combating international terrorism and providing permanent protection for personal data with the highest possible degree of determination and effectiveness. In view of the importance of data protection, the SPD delegation did not make its decision lightly. After long and careful consideration, however, we are now able to vote in favour of the agreement: the Social Democrats have succeeded in providing for the establishment of permanent European monitoring in connection with the extraction of the data directly on the ground in the US Treasury Department – including the facility to stop the extraction of data. For us, the top priority was limiting the transfer of bulk data. SEPA data are not covered by the agreement; most transfers are not affected at all. The five-year data retention period is intended to be reviewed annually, whereby any data that is not needed is to be deleted sooner than this. In addition, an annual review of compliance with all data protection standards, with the involvement of data protection supervisors, is provided for. Even though we would have preferred the monitoring role and the transfer of data to be given to a judicial authority, Europol must carry out its mandate for approving the data transfer, provided for in the agreement, under the strict scrutiny of the EU. Although Europol has a reliable data protection system, it needs to be brought into line with the Treaty of Lisbon so that it can perform its duties under full democratic scrutiny.

 Mr President, it was not possible for me to vote ‘No’ in the vote because the voting machine only displayed something once I had pressed the ‘Yes’ button followed by the ‘Abstention’ button. Please would you check once again how the machine is collecting and counting the votes, because in my opinion, it was not conclusive. I was not the only one who found this; a number of other Members had the same experience. They were unable to press the ‘Abstention’ button or the ‘No’ button, but instead had to vote ‘Yes’ first. It makes this voting process rather hazardous. Please would you therefore check again how the votes were counted. Matthias Groote  (S&amp;D

Madam President, first of all I should like to thank the rapporteur, Mr Méndez de Vigo. I see no need to convene a convention. It is a matter of detail that needs to be clarified. Since 1979, the European Parliament has been elected in a direct and secret ballot and that is the way it should continue to be done in future, too. We and the Council would be well advised to deal with this problem as quickly as possible at an intergovernmental conference, because out of the 18 Members, 16 are in a state of suspense, which is rather intolerable. The ball is therefore back in the Council’s court. I would ask the Council not to give in on this point because one Member State has failed to find clear rules on account of it expecting the Treaty of Lisbon to enter into force sooner. I am pleased that we now have this Treaty in place, but we now have our homework to do. The Méndez de Vigo report is a good basis for strengthening this process. However, the Council would be well advised not to succumb to the temptation to accept Members being sent here from a national parliament. That would set a precedent and I am not happy to accept that. Therefore, the rapporteur has my full support, with the proviso that no Members be sent here from national parliaments. Matthias Groote  (S&amp;D

 Madam President, Commissioner, Mr Carlgren, ladies and gentlemen, the subject of climate change will keep us occupied much longer than the financial and economic crisis. There are parallels – both cost lots of money, and Copenhagen will be about reaching an agreement on the financial tools for the third world and the developing countries. The Copenhagen conference must succeed, and we can play our part in achieving that. Yesterday, we did a good job, we adopted the resolution in the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Food Safety by a large majority, and I think that the resolution will achieve a large majority here in Parliament, and in so doing, we will change the political climate as Copenhagen approaches. There is often a psychological side to it, and we should all play our part in that. I do still have one specific concern. In the European Parliament, we have worked to get aviation included in emissions trading, and in the end we succeeded. I therefore call on the Commission and the Council to ensure that this subject is pursued consistently in Copenhagen. We must achieve international agreement to the effect that shipping, and also aviation, are incorporated into the successor treaty to the Kyoto Protocol. This is because these two transport sectors are growing to a disproportionate degree and are therefore contributing in a disproportionate way to global warming. We should not exceed the 2 degree Celsius mark. That, in fact, is where the parallels between the financial crisis and climate change cease. If we go over this mark, we will have done irreparable damage to our planet and that means that it is damage that we will not be able to reverse. Matthias Groote  (S&amp;D

 Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, I very much liked what the Commissioner described here today with regard to the Desertec project. This project has huge potential and its appeal indeed lies in the fact that it is made up of many separate small projects. This will create jobs and will prepare the way for the environmentally sound industrial policy that we are striving for. I have a question for the Commission. When you were talking about the Desertec project, I had the feeling that the handbrake was on to some extent. What concrete measures are planned with regard to network infrastructure, which is a massive problem in connection with the development of renewable energy? The idea is, of course, to transmit the electricity to Europe via high voltage direct current lines from the deserts. What supporting measures can the European Commission take with regard to this? Is something already being considered in this regard? What can we expect from the next Commission in this area? Matthias Groote  (S&amp;D

 Madam President, Commissioners, ladies and gentlemen, this is, of course, not the first time that we have debated the subject of Opel and the car industry. I am pleased that the rescue succeeded. There were other proposals on the table, such as a structured insolvency. In the supply industry – and I have just come from Bavaria, where I visited a supply company – people are very urgently dependent on orders. Things have got out of control. If Opel, too, had been driven to insolvency, things would have been very, very bad and the consequences would have been devastating. We have just heard the Commission’s conclusions. There was a car industry summit, in which the Commission took part, but we actually heard nothing after the summit. Today we have heard where the problem may lie. what is not possible. That must change in future – we need to hear from the Commission what is possible, so as to forestall nationalistic debates. The Commission needs to mediate more effectively so that we pursue a common European industrial policy. That is also what I hope for from the next Commission. Norbert Glante,

 Mr President, Commissioner, I would like to apologise. The Parliament building’s lifts were very busy. Perhaps the manufacturers should think about including a priority override function. That is why I am a little late. Commissioner, I am much obliged to you for answering these pressing questions. Forgive me if I repeat myself a little, but I simply want to emphasise a point – I believe that the GMES (Global Monitoring for Environment and Security) programme is one of the two leading initiatives in the European Union’s space policy and is of key importance for the monitoring of the Earth. This, in turn, is an indispensable instrument in the fight against climate change, environmental pollution, disaster prevention and security, sustainable development, mobility and crisis management. GMES was established as a Union programme and will receive funding of about EUR 3.2 billion from the budget until 2013. The lack of a workable financial plan for long-term, solid financial support would probably mean that the costs will rise in the long term. The programme and the associated supply of data could be temporarily suspended or even abandoned entirely. In the final analysis, this could mean that the investments previously made will have been in vain. Europe could lose its independence and technological edge in relation to this important space infrastructure. What is at issue? We are talking about a sum of EUR 5.8 billion for the period 2014 to 2020, admittedly a very large amount of money, but one that offers a very substantial economic benefit. Despite the current budgetary difficulties in many Member States, GMES must be sufficiently financed in the budget and through the financial perspective. Mr Barnier, you wrote us a letter recently. If I might quote you: ‘Europe should not be satisfied with defensive answers to the crisis – however important this may be – Europe must also open up the prospect of new growth for its citizens!’ This idea could be expressed very succinctly. It is possible to drive oneself to destruction through excessive savings. This principle applies in a different context to an important Member State of the European Union. If GMES is to be run on an intergovernmental basis in future outside the budget, so that Parliament would no longer have a say in the project, then, in my opinion, the European space strategy would be doomed before it even began. This is why we are calling for a legislative proposal from the Commission for the long-term administration, financing and implementation of GMES and the embedding of the budget in medium-term financial planning. The Danish Presidency announced conclusions for the Competitiveness Council on 21 February and then cancelled them again because there was no majority in the Council. Some Member States question whether the Council Working Party on Space should be responsible for this project, which I find particularly surprising. Unfortunately, this development in the Council has given rise to two camps. One camp, a group of Member States that fund GMES through the budget, has also written to you. A second group wants to follow the proposal tabled by the Commission. If this stalemate continues, I fear that GMES may fail and that an enormous opportunity will have been lost. This is quite apart from the fact that many millions of euro already spent on the project will have been spent for nothing. The greatest risk, however, is that we will set a precedent, and that the Member States will use this to justify activities outside of the Treaty of Lisbon. I thought we had put these times behind us. I have three demands. Firstly, I hope that we, the European Parliament, will be courageous enough to continue to finance the major projects of the EU, such as GMES, but also Galileo and ITER, through the budget and to establish separate budget lines with sufficient reserves for this purpose. Secondly, I hope and demand that the Commission tables this legislative proposal as soon as possible. Thirdly, I call on the Council to push through reasonable and sufficient funding within the budget and to take the necessary decision. Norbert Glante,

 Mr President, I want to keep this brief. I know Members are not always pleased when the rapporteur speaks again before the vote. I simply wanted to thank all those involved and, in this context, I hope that this signal can soon be put to use so that there are enough satellites in orbit, and that the Member States come up with sufficient money for the future budget and the financial perspective so that the Galileo navigation satellite system is actually put into operation. Many thanks once again; I hope we have a bright future ahead of us. Norbert Neuser  (S&amp;D

 Mr President, Baroness Ashton, you spoke about how important it is to bring about peace in the Middle East. You said that the Middle East Quartet is playing a positive role and that the EU should support Jordan and the Quartet. The Israeli Government claims that it is in favour of a responsible peace process and a two-state solution, but the reality looks rather different. The Gaza Strip is still an open-air prison. The EU and the United Nations are constantly providing more money to feed the people in Gaza and the Israeli army has destroyed aid projects set up by the EU in occupied Palestinian territory in recent years which cost EUR 50 million. The aim of these aid projects was to provide better living conditions for the Palestinians and they included schools, infrastructure and education projects. We owe it to our taxpayers in the EU to make it clear to the Israelis that this situation has to change and that Israel’s settlement policy must finally come to an end. Norbert Neuser,  
rapporteur.

 Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, the beginning of 2012 is a timely occasion for the report on universal energy access, as the United Nations General Assembly has designated 2012 as the International Year of Sustainable Energy for All. To me and to all my fellow Members who worked with me on this report in committee, two facts are particularly important. The first is that we want renewable energy. The second is that we want everyone to have access to these new sources of energy. Consequently, these sources of energy must be affordable by everyone. In the Committee on Development, we worked together very constructively, including with NGOs. In this connection, particular mention must be made of the London-based organisation, Practical Action, and of Sweden’s Stockholm Environment Institute. Our secretariat also provided us with vigorous support in finding ways in which we can forge ahead with universal access to renewable energy. Allow me to clarify once more what we are talking about here. At present, 1.3 billion people live without electricity. A total of 2.7 billion people use biomass to cook, on improvised stoves. The vast majority of these live in rural areas, mainly in sub-Saharan Africa and India. To give just one example: 20% of the population of Kenya has access to the grid, but only 5% of the rural population. Access to energy brings not only light and power, but also – and above all – cooking facilities and heating. Yet access to energy is still not a Millennium Development Goal. Without access to it, however, it will be difficult to achieve our Millennium Development Goals. That is why we call in the report for renewable energy to be included in the post-2015 MDGs. It is hard to see how schools, training facilities, health centres and hospitals could exist or function without electricity. Cooking and heating with biomass causes millions of deaths each year in shacks, as a result of harmful smoke. Many of Africa’s governments have therefore banned the use of coal for cooking and heating, for climate and health reasons. In practice, however, those responsible have to look the other way when coal is produced and sold. We very much welcome the fact that, in its Agenda for Change, the Commission has included energy as a guiding priority. Allow me, therefore, to summarise our key demands in the report once more. We call on the EU and the Member States to support the UN goals of universal access to energy by 2030 and to align their policies accordingly. We call on the Commission to focus on small, local renewable energy projects, because only then will it be possible to reach the majority of the population. More money should be made available for this. The European Investment Bank and the other European development banks are not geared towards small, local energy projects. That has to change; universal energy access should be prominently represented in the Rio+20 process. Finally, universal energy access should be included as a Millennium Development Goal post-2015.

 Madam President, Baroness Ashton, the European Union is involved in a number of missions in Afghanistan on the basis of United Nations resolutions. Too many young soldiers from Europe have lost their lives in Afghanistan. A large number have been seriously injured or are suffering from the mental stress caused by military service. Thousands of civilian aid workers from Europe risk their lives every day to help to bring about a better future in Afghanistan. All of them and all of us have a right to know how Europe’s commitment in Afghanistan can be bought to successful and lasting conclusion and how long we will continue to have a military presence in the country. What needs to be changed or improved and what are the objectives of the new EU strategy for Afghanistan? We need to make greater efforts in the area of civil reconstruction. We must at last make progress with retraining the Afghan police force and judiciary. We know that there will not be a military solution and, therefore, we must increase our efforts to bring about a political solution to the conflict, by means of the EU and a common foreign policy. We must show determination and push forward with the internal reconciliation process in Afghanistan and include moderate members of the Taliban. We need to put in place specific initiatives, in particular at a regional level, to stabilise the situation. This involves, in particular, effective means of combating drug cultivation and trafficking. Our strategy includes good proposals. We call on the Afghan Government to demonstrate that it has the will to introduce a better system of governance which is free from corruption. However, the new EU strategy can only be successful if it no longer plays a passive role, but actively involves the neighbouring countries. Baroness Ashton, we are putting our hopes on you, we are relying on you and you have our full support. Norbert Neuser  (S&amp;D

 Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, the signs look very promising for the EU-Africa summit. The summit will revolve entirely around an equal partnership for a better common future. Two months after the Millennium Development Goals summit in New York, we have the unique opportunity to take further specific, binding steps in the fight against poverty in Africa. We are, of course, following all of China’s extensive activities on the African continent to safeguard its own supply of raw materials with great concern. It is very much reminiscent of the behaviour of colonial states. The European Union must, therefore, press for a regulation that promotes the common good of, and social progress in, the African countries. That will create work that is sustainable. I therefore expressly welcome the Commission’s proposal to employ effective controls in the context of raw materials management. Together with the African partners, we need to support a structural policy that promotes growth and climate protection in order for the African people to escape from the poverty trap. We support the Commission’s proposals for social cohesion, because they will help to create jobs. We must put the people of Africa in a position where they can achieve the goal of earning a living wage through their own work. Finally, I would like to provide a summary of the following priorities. Firstly, we need to strengthen the African Union and its representations in all international bodies – the Security Council, G20 and the Pan-African Parliament. The Millennium Goals must be achieved in Africa by 2015 by means of further initiatives. We must ensure that the social standards stipulated by the International Labour Organisation (ILO) are laid down and made binding in any economic and trade agreements between the EU and Africa.

 Madam President, Commissioner, I welcome the clear words chosen by Mr Piebalgs. It is important for the European Parliament to show clearly where it stands and also to condemn the brutality that has taken place there. It has taken us a long time to hold the debate on Western Sahara in the European Parliament, and I think that we have been too hesitant in our actions and that we act only after there have been fatalities there. I am pleased that we will be able to adopt a resolution tomorrow with all parties, which will perhaps not go as far as one or other of the groups would like, but it represents a broad consensus and is a clear signal to Morocco and to the population of Western Sahara that the European Parliament stands by its fundamental values. As chair of the Intergroup, I would like to offer my sincere thanks to all of its members, who have ensured that Western Sahara has remained, and will continue to remain, on the agenda. I am certain that, together with Mr Piebalgs and Baroness Ashton, we must remain committed to Western Sahara. Norbert Neuser  (S&amp;D

 Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, achievement of the Millennium Development Goals by 2015 is crucially dependent on how much money the rich industrialised nations make available for combating hunger and poverty, reducing child and maternal mortality and combating malaria and AIDS. Our conclusion is sobering. Our promises will not be met. Prior to the financial crisis, we in Europe, as rich industrialised nations, had promised the poorest countries USD 50 billion for this year, 2010. It will be significantly less than that: around USD 36 billion. Even the agreed twelve-point action plan, according to which the wealthy countries want to give 0.7% of their gross national income in development aid, will not be fulfilled. Some countries are setting a good example, but my country, Germany, does not look good. We ought to follow the example of other countries like Sweden, Luxembourg, Belgium, Ireland, the United Kingdom and even Spain. Peter Simon,  
deputising for the rapporteur Mojca Kleva Kekuš

 Mr[nbsp ]President, our colleague, Mojca Kleva Kekuš, who is the co-rapporteur on this file, became a mother two months ago so she cannot be here with us today. I wish her and her little daughter all the best. She did a lot of good work on this dossier, so allow me now to present her words and ideas. A year ago, with the change in international standards, Parliament received a package of Commission proposals for updating and improving European legislation on combating money laundering more effectively. At a time when technology and the means available to criminals are constantly evolving, it is crucial that our legislation should keep pace with the changing realities. We now have before us an updated regulation, which will enhance the transparency of fund transfers of all types: domestic and cross-border. The regulation lays down rules for our banks and other payment-service providers regarding information on payers and payees which they need to collect and transfer throughout the entire payment chain. This update will make it easier for law enforcement authorities to track funds transferred by criminals and terrorists. The new rules will help to identify not only the payers but also the receivers of laundered money. The new regulation focuses more closely on the effectiveness of regimes to counter money laundering and terrorist financing, and on ensuring greater clarity and consistency of rules across the Member States. It is also broader in scope, with a view to addressing new threats. The rapporteur, Ms[nbsp ]Kleva Kekuš, is also pleased that, thanks to Parliament’s involvement, the regulation is now more effective in ensuring compliance with European data-protection requirements, guaranteeing that all the safeguards protecting individual rights in relation to personal data will actually be applied. What remains crucial in making the fight against money laundering effective, however, is the work on enforcement and implementation of the new rules. To combat this problem effectively we need two things at the same time: a coordinated response from law enforcement bodies in the Member States and a standard procedure for financial institutions and payment-service providers. The new rules now centre on a risk-based approach, which should strengthen the capabilities and roles of payment-service providers in identifying transfers that smell fishy. To conclude, the danger of money laundering is also closely linked with the problems of tax evasion and tax havens. This Parliament has, on numerous occasions, called for concrete and effective action to eliminate the scandalous tax gap. The improvement of these rules on fund transfers will serve as one small piece of the puzzle. The rapporteur, Ms[nbsp ]Kleva Kekuš, believes that, thanks to good cooperation and hard work on the part of the other co-rapporteur and all the shadows, the text in front of us is something that Parliament can be proud of. She thanks everyone for their contribution. Peter Simon  (S&amp;D

Mr President, Mr Louca, you have emphasised the importance of this House in relation to the continued development of economic and monetary union. I therefore allow myself to refer to paragraph 8 of the report that we are adopting today. With this paragraph this House calls on the Council to finally bring to a conclusion the legislative procedures relating to the realisation of economic and monetary union that are being blocked by the Council. Nine months ago this House adopted a key part of the banking union legislation, that relating to deposit guarantees, at first reading. Since then it has been up to the Council to respond and find a common position. For nine months the Council has been sleeping on this. For nine months the Council has been inactive, and you, Mr Louca, as the President-in-Office of the Council, have taken no action – absolutely no action at all – in relation to the European Parliament in four and a half months to move this legislative procedure forward! We have promised European taxpayers that future crises will not be paid for by them, but by the banks themselves. If we now endeavour to implement supervision quickly, we will be making use of the European Stability Mechanism. Also taxpayers’ money! A reliable deposit guarantee scheme, a reliable fund for the recovery and resolution of banks – these are funds that relieve the burden on taxpayers. Devote yourself to these funds with the same zeal! Make exactly the same progress with them! You will be judged on this by European taxpayers, but also by this House. Peter Simon  (S&amp;D
). 
 – (DE) 
Mr President, Commissioner, I extend warm thanks for your cooperation on one of the important elements in the banking union project, deposit guarantee schemes. You have quite rightly pointed out that the four pillars alongside supervision are of equal importance. Deposit guarantee schemes and crisis funds are two of these four pillars. This morning, Commission President Barroso stated that we could not have a situation where, in future, citizens would still have to pick up the tab for the mistakes of the banks. As you know, you have significant support in this House for the best possible financing of deposit guarantee schemes and crisis management. However, you know as well as I do that our common opponent is sitting in the Council. You know as well as I do that the deposit guarantee scheme that we adopted with a large, cross-party majority seven months ago with a worthwhile level of funding that would bring stability to the area has been given the green light by this House and sent forward for implementation. For the last seven months, the governments of the Member States have done nothing to meet us half way, nothing to ensure the future stability of the systems. I would like to ask at this juncture how you think we can rescue this situation. One thing is clear: Parliament will not allow plans to be drawn up for chronically underfunded guarantee schemes that are not worthy of the name. How can we work together to persuade the Council to keep its promises, so that our citizens are no longer asked to provide backing for banks that should be wound up or to pay out on deposits, but that the banks themselves should provide their own protections in future by contributing to corresponding funds? Peter Simon,  
rapporteur.
 – (DE)
 Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, tomorrow we are to vote on the new regulation on the deposit guarantee scheme at first reading. This is remarkable on several counts. Firstly, on a procedural level, because, as part of the new regulation of the financial markets, we have thus far managed to reach an agreement between the Council and Parliament at first reading, where both sides at least had a solution that they agreed they could live with. That is not the case here. Agreement between the Council and Parliament has proved impossible. The other remarkable thing is that this proved impossible at a point where the new financial market regulations are most tangible to the people of Europe, because it is their fate at stake, their savings books and their current accounts – in other words, their money. The European Commission made a proposal that initially seemed a little too inflexible in Parliament’s view when it came to the way in which guarantee schemes were to be organised. As rapporteur, I am very pleased that, thanks to the excellent support, cooperation and constant dialogue with the shadow rapporteurs, I have finally succeeded in producing a draft that takes account of this. This means that in future, the principles promised by politicians in all Member States to their people will be embraced in Europe and that, in the event of future bank crises and bank failures, the taxpayer will not be required to pick up the tab, but rather the banks will have saved the necessary resources in a fund during the good times, or at least the less bad times, to enable them to pay depositors, current account holders and savers in the event of a crisis involving the collapse of a bank. In addition to suggesting such a stable fund, we also came up with a solution for the periods within which ordinary citizens should get their money back. I think that the period of one week that we suggest is within a timeframe where people will still manage to get by and will be able to go about their daily business without needing additional cash. We did not think that longer periods without access to finances would be reasonable. We continue to believe that we need to ensure that the different risk profiles of the banks in Europe should be taken into account when payments are made into a guarantee fund. Riskier banks should be required to pay in more than banks that have a lower risk because of their business models. All of these principles were brought together into an overall draft here in Parliament, finding broad majority support in the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs, in a broad coalition of parties, from the Left, through the Socialists, the Greens and the Liberals to the Conservatives. When we came to negotiate with the Member States, this made it all the more difficult for us to understand why they were unwilling to provide the necessary resources for a guarantee fund, to be provided by the banks in order to establish sufficient stability, why it proved impossible to achieve a faster payout for depositors, and why a consumer-friendly solution could not be found, even after eight months of negotiations. We therefore agreed, by means of a first reading, to give a clear signal in favour of consumer protection in Europe. We are prepared to go to a swift second reading with the Council. We wish to thank the Commission for its efforts in brokering a deal. However, we believe that tomorrow, we will have to show the European public what we think is appropriate in relation to depositor protection in Europe. Peter Simon,  
rapporteur.

 Mr President, Commissioner, I can only return these expressions of thanks in equal measure. Like you, I am convinced that there is a positive prospect of success in the coming weeks and months under the Danish Presidency, provided all those involved, by which I mean quite explicitly the Council, enter into constructive negotiations. Constructive negotiations also mean being willing actually to provide certain minimum standards in these guarantee schemes, as emphasised verbally on frequent occasions to the public. Then I believe that we will have no problem and that we will start to see light at the end of the tunnel. I would like to thank the rapporteurs and the shadow rapporteurs for their kind words and for their support to date. I believe that we will also be able to continue working together in this positive vein in the coming months and would like to add my voice to that of Mr Barnier in relation to what we have heard from Ms Ford and Ms Swinburne. I think I could not have put it better myself at this point. I would therefore like to limit my answer to a single point, namely, to the comment made by Mr Stoyanov in relation to the question of a four week payout period versus a seven day payout period. None of us want to make promises that we cannot keep. We therefore need to make it clear that the schemes can pay out within the promised deadlines. National legislation requires British banks to take all the necessary steps to facilitate this. They have already been able to do that. If British banks can do this in seven days, then I believe banks in your country, and mine too, will be able to do the same. We will allow them sufficient time to be able to make money available as quickly as possible in the interests of the public. I believe that this is a point that we will need to discuss further in our forthcoming negotiations with the Council. I would again like to thank all my colleagues and hope that we shall produce a result under the Danish Presidency. Peter Simon,  
rapporteur.

 Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, public services are a fundamental pillar of our European social model and not only play a key role for the individual citizen, but are also of enormous importance for the wellbeing of society at large. For this reason, the following question should be uppermost in our minds when we come to reform the EU State aid rules on services of general economic interest. What conditions are needed to ensure the highest possible service quality and, on the other hand, to guarantee universal access for all levels within the population? The key to the provision and organisation of such high-quality public services is certainty among service providers and public authorities in relation to the general legal conditions, on the one hand, and greater proportionality in the regulations, on the other, so that more attention is paid to the diversity of the various kinds of public service and so that administrative effort is reduced. Thus, the EU State aid rules can only be reformed if the special function of public services is taken into account and if the subsidiarity principle is strictly observed. In addition, a legal framework for public services should be established for a sufficient degree of legal certainty. For us in the Group of the Progressive Alliance of Socialists and Democrats in the European Parliament, the legal basis for this would be Article 14 of the Treaty of Lisbon. However, as we know, opinion in the European Parliament has been divided on this issue for many years. Nonetheless, we believe that this report has succeeded in its objective of finding a compromise that could be accepted by almost all sides. The administrative effort involved in managing compensatory payments to those providing public services is currently too high. This is particularly true for small authorities and service providers. The increase we have called for in the thresholds for exemption from mandatory notification of the European Commission when claiming compensatory payments would provide initial relief. The State aid rules must be designed so that the administrative effort expended by the local authorities and service providers is proportionate to the potential impact on the internal European market and on competition. The special de minimis
 arrangements we propose provide an important basis for this, involving a general exception to the regulations for purely local services and social services. To ensure that we cater more precisely to the special role of social services, we would call for a clear definition and protection of their function and character. In addition, our report also clearly rejects the proposal from the European Commission that efficiency criteria should be introduced for services of general interest as a prerequisite for establishing their compatibility with EU competition rules. The European Commission is going beyond its remit here, as it is simply responsible for controlling State aid. On the other hand, the definition of economic conditions is solely a matter for the Member States and can only be regulated on a European level with the cooperation of the European Parliament. In this context, I would like to close by thanking my colleagues, the shadow rapporteurs, for excellent cross-party cooperation in the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs. The clear vote in favour of my report at committee level is evidence of this results-based, solutions-oriented cooperation. I am therefore confident that in tomorrow’s plenary vote, we shall also succeed in sending out a clear signal from the European Parliament to the European Commission demanding sustainable, future-proofed general conditions in the area of public services. Peter Simon  (S&amp;D

 Madam President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, right across Europe, our cities and communities have to struggle with problem districts. Right across Europe, we try to solve this problem by bringing these disadvantaged areas and the people living in them up to the level of normal life in the rest of our towns and cities. If, however, we now lay down criteria in the field of social housing, as the Commission is doing here, if we lay down criteria that explicitly – as some Members have already said – preclude a mixing of the population in these areas, that will undermine all the efforts made by the competent parties on the ground for decades. It will also undermine ventures that the European Union has promoted with its Community initiatives Urban and Urban II. If, here, we restrict the criteria according to which social housing can be subsidised in such a way that actually only the poorest of the poor, the most disadvantaged of the disadvantaged, receive a subsidy and can be helped within the framework of social housing, we will actually be putting up obstacles to this segment of the population mixing in disadvantaged districts, something that is, in fact, urgently needed. This will lead to more social exclusion of precisely these population groups and will only increase these problems in our cities. With that in mind, a broad definition and broad interpretation of the principle of subsidiarity are the order of the day, and I would be grateful to the Commission if it could briefly express a position in this regard. Petra Kammerevert,  
on behalf of the S&amp;D Group.

 Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, I, too, would like to offer my sincere thanks to Ms Geringer de Oedenberg for the results of her negotiations with the Council. I know that it was difficult to also get the numerous good ideas that we had in Parliament through the tough negotiations with the Council. Certainly, with the directive, we have now found a viable route to granting works of literature orphan work status and preserving this cultural heritage for the future while making it accessible. However, I do still have some minor doubts about whether we have really found an efficient solution for audiovisual works. Across the EU, a cultural asset has accumulated in the archives, especially of broadcasters after 1945, that is of inestimable value. Preserving this cultural heritage for the future, too, poses an enormous challenge on both a technical and financial level. The number of rights holders for audiovisual works is frequently higher than for written works. The diligent search that, under the directive, will also be necessary for audiovisual works takes a form that is therefore intensive in terms of costs, time and personnel. There is a great cultural policy interest in preserving our audiovisual heritage, especially in this Internet age. We now need to carefully observe whether we have succeeded, through this directive, in noticeably reducing the number of audiovisual works in the European Union that are unusable in practical situations due to the rights being unclear. The review clause offers us a good opportunity here. In any case, we need to prevent audiovisual material in the archives going to waste as unrecoverable because it proves too costly to clear up who holds the rights. It goes without saying that, for orphan works, too, rights holders must be given reasonable remuneration. The involvement of collecting societies and other rights declaration systems here could help to remove uncertainties about rights, allow originators to come into their own, and thus also to release cultural treasures. I would have liked to have seen a little greater progress at this juncture, but the first step has been taken, and I believe we will work on this further over the forthcoming years. Petra Kammerevert  (S&amp;D

 Mr President, we must get rid of ACTA and I am pleased that the debate here in Parliament is moving in precisely this direction. ACTA is an attack on fundamental rights, such as the protection of privacy, freedom of information and communication and the right to informational self-determination. It is the whole host of vague legal terms which have opened the door to this. We are faced with the threat that legal protection and legal procedures will no longer be available. We are right to be concerned that providers will be forced to monitor the Internet, put web blocks in place and filter content. Ultimately, this could lead to law enforcement being privatised and the providers being turned into deputy sheriffs. The protection of individuals’ copyright must not, under any circumstances, lead to the freedom of information and communication being undermined. It is true that we need a modern copyright law which has a sensible balance between the interests of the originators and of the users. I would like the Commission finally to submit a proposal for this. ACTA will not help in this respect at all. Instead, it is forcing us to move in a very specific direction. This is why we must say ‘No’ to ACTA tomorrow. Petra Kammerevert  (S&amp;D

Madam President, I would like to bring a little reality to the illusion that has just been so elegantly produced because, from a culture and media policy point of view, the Council’s Common Position is, in fact, a disappointment and unsatisfactory. Frequencies are a scarce public good with considerable cultural and media policy significance. As long as, for example, radio needs frequencies to broadcast its services, these are of particular importance for the freedom of the media and of expression in Europe. The Committee on Culture and Education has put forward a series of proposals for how this can reasonably be taken into consideration. Alongside clear wordings on the special role of radio and the consideration that it needs to be given, we warned that we need to open the door now to the second digital dividend. We called for clear compensation rules so that it is clarified that switchover-related costs, for example for the new procurement of technology in theatres, will be assumed and that provision must be made for compensation for investments that made the digital dividend possible. There is nothing left of all this, apart from the brief reference to the Telecoms Package and a few permissive provisions for the Member States. I now expect the Commission and the Member States to at least demonstrate in their practical actions that they are aware of their responsibilities, that their dealings with this public good will not be solely in pursuit of economic benefit and that they are aware of its importance for media diversity and for the cultural interests of our society. Petra Kammerevert  (S&amp;D
). 
 – (DE)
 Mr President, an open Internet and the guarantee of non-discriminatory access for everyone are essential prerequisites for the freedom of communication, the freedom of information, media pluralism and diversity of opinion. We are therefore sending an important and appropriate signal to the Commission and also to the Member States that we want the ‘best effort’ principle as well as fundamental transparency regulations to be laid down. However, I would have liked us to call on the Commission today to clearly define net neutrality and to enshrine it in law. If we wait any longer, we run the risk that network operators will create a version of reality that will be very difficult to put right later on. I would also have liked to have seen a very clear ban on the control of the content of data packets. I would have liked the back door that this resolution leaves open to be closed today, and from the discussion, I sense that many fellow Members agree with me here. I believe that we should continue to work on this. Petra Kammerevert,  
rapporteur for the opinion of the Committee on Culture and Education

 Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, sexual abuse and sexual violence against children and young people as well as images of this are indeed among the worst possible crimes that anyone could commit against young people. Our highest priority must be to protect the victims, to prosecute the perpetrators and to punish them in a procedure that follows the rule of law. It is therefore good that, together, we have found a way to tackle this crime throughout the EU and to obtain a common basis for this. In the Committee on Culture and Education, in addition to the issues of prevention, effective prosecution, information and more instruction in the use of media, one principle was particularly important to us and that was the principle of ‘deletion rather than blocking’. I am therefore pleased that, after a long struggle, we have succeeded in stipulating the deletion of websites depicting sexual violence against children and young people. The Commission proposed making it mandatory for all Member State to block these websites. However, it is no help to any child at all simply to draw a curtain, so to speak. Internet blocks are ineffective, imprecise, easy to circumvent and do not help to combat sexual abuse. In contrast, they create a censorship infrastructure, an instrument for controlling communication streams and are thus a threat to fundamental rights. In Germany, this has now been implemented. I very much hope that this example will also be followed in other Member States and that they will not use the option of blocking, as stated in the directive. Petra Kammerevert,  
rapporteur for the opinion of the Committee on Culture and Education.

 Madam President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, political initiatives for developing fast Internet connections across the board are, in principle, to be welcomed. However, the spectrum is a scarce resource and, above all, it is a public good. It was therefore a particular concern of the Committee on Culture and Education that it be made clear that the spectrum is, and remains, essential for the fulfilment of a wide range of societal, cultural and social functions. For this reason, it was particularly important to us that the requirements of the telecoms package for safeguarding media pluralism and cultural diversity were not thrown out by the back door. Both public and private broadcasting are essential guarantors of media pluralism and diversity of opinion in Europe. We must ensure that they can continue to fulfil their vital functions unimpeded in future, too. The Committee on Culture and Education had therefore proposed that the 790 band not be opened in the first instance, but unfortunately, the Committee on Industry, Research and Energy did not follow our suggestion. Although it is mentioned in several places that the interests of broadcasting are to be taken into consideration, the Committee on Culture and Education would have liked there to have been much clearer wording in this regard. It was particularly important to us that, before spectrum allocation, clear regulations be laid down to prevent theatres and anyone using wireless microphones, for example, from being saddled with the cost of paying for a frequency change or for new technology. We are all called on to continue to ensure a fair balance of interests for all parties concerned. I hope that we will succeed in doing so in future, too. Petra Kammerevert  (S&amp;D

 Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, first of all, I would once again like to offer my sincere thanks to Mrs Trüpel for the truly excellent report that we are debating today. I believe that it is a splendid project that will be making Europe’s diverse cultural heritage available to the people of Europe and throughout the world in a digital online library. However, it still requires further joint efforts on our part to actually make this project a success. A significant prerequisite for this is, in the view of my group, the free – and that means also, as far as possible, cost-free – access to our cultural heritage via Europeana. In the joint discussions, we have reached a good compromise, which protects the interests of authors of protected works on the one hand while, at the same time, providing the necessary free accessibility, and I would very much like the Commission to also take account of and adopt these proposals in future. Another prerequisite is that the Member States become increasingly aware of their responsibility. For my own country, this means that it is not acceptable for Goethe to be available in Polish and French, but not in the original German. In this regard, we must all jointly call on the Member States more strongly to once again provide the appropriate financial resources to make Europeana a real success on this level as well. Udo Bullmann  (S&amp;D

Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, with or without a summit, Europe is still in recession. There is a lack of growth stimulus and a shortage of jobs. Mr Barroso and Mr Van Rompuy, you will have to launch some fresh initiatives before your term in office comes to end, otherwise there will be no end to this crisis in Europe. A summit, no matter how intensive the debate, cannot change anything. Europe’s young people have no jobs.  Mr Barroso, you have instruments at your disposal. Mr Andor and the Commission could utilise the available instruments. Why are we not making cuts within the framework that we already have, within the framework of the commitments made in the European Semester, tying the Member States into this process and starting straight away? Why are we not focusing on the young unemployed based on a specific annual percentage proposed by the Commission? Why can we do all kinds of things on a binding basis but we apparently cannot combat youth unemployment this way? The European Parliament is waiting for you to take the initiative.  We need more economic policy competences at the European level, that is absolutely right. The basic question is this: who is doing the regulating here, and what are they regulating? Every time the German Finance Minister, Mr Schäuble, comes and talks to us, he says that he would like to have a strong Finance Commissioner. We say, fine, let us give the job to Mr Rehn. That is the Mr Rehn who is possibly listening now to what this House has to say. Mr Rehn, it would be wonderful if you were given more competencies. However, let us make a deal, and let us be quite clear about it: you would then negotiate your mandate with the European Parliament. Life would be very different then. You would not have to ring round all of the European capitals to find out what they wanted at that particular moment. You would not have to negotiate any bilateral agreements with people who have no idea what it is all about. No, you hammer out your mandate with this House. Europe has all the means at its disposal and all the techniques it needs. We should be strengthening the European Union in its present form. We do not need another Europe. We do not need any new institutions. We need to strengthen the existing institutions, and that means strengthening the European Parliament. That is the only way to move out of the crisis. Udo Bullmann  (S&amp;D
). 
 – (DE)
 Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, indeed, the summit has turned around the debate. However, Mr Van Rompuy, the Member States have not yet dared to make the leap. Indeed, it is a major breakthrough to say that we want to make the European Stability Mechanism more active. That is only right and proper. If we do not, we will not really be able to halt the crisis. However, it is also entirely clear to me why the first Member States are already backing off again, why the first heroes of their troops are already disappearing back into the bushes. Why? It is because they forgot to clarify how the stability mechanism would be financed so as to be able to afford this. That takes us to the problem at the heart of this debate. Europe faces a challenge. We will only overcome the crisis if we are able to make a great qualitative leap: more Europe, better ways of working and more joint action. However, we cannot make a run-up to this great leap while at the same time slamming on the brakes. That is what is constantly demonstrated by Member States. I can also say, as regards the second topic, that it is right to say that we want to create a programme for growth. The growth programme is essential. You have opportunities to do so, Mr Van Rompuy, as does Mr Barroso. Simply show us the figures, however, for how much this growth programme can generate. Will it be 0.1%, 0.2%, 0.6% of gross national income? What will it cost to implement the rules of the fiscal pact, which are still too rigid? Perhaps 1%, 1.5%? What is the bill? We need to do more in this direction if it is to work. Udo Bullmann  (S&amp;D
). 
 – (DE)
 Mr President, I have one question for the Council and the Commission. I would like to say to the representatives of the Council Presidency: you know very well that the level of public investment in countries like Germany is currently zero. The situation is not much better elsewhere. This means that public property in Europe is falling into disrepair. Wherever the troika is not forcing states to sell this property below its real value, it is becoming dilapidated. What is your response to this? I have not heard you say anything. In the past, Mr Monti’s name was on everyone’s lips and he was frequently quoted when he talked about the internal market. Today, Mr Monti is saying how important it is for us to invest in our national economies and none of you have mentioned his name. Neither the Council nor the Commission have made any comment on his proposals. I would very much like to know why. I believe that there is a reason why we are not making progress. Your explanations that, on the one hand, we need to save and, on the other, that we must stimulate growth are all correct. Unfortunately, however, they do not explain why something is happening. Instead, they explain why nothing is happening. There is a reason why this is the case, which is that the people who have the upper hand in the Commission and in the Council believe that the best way of climbing a mountain is to put on the brakes on the way up. This runs counter to the laws of physics, just as your economic proposals run counter to the laws of mathematics. I expect you to make changes, because if you do not take up a clear position, you will not help Europe to make progress. Udo Bullmann  (S&amp;D
). 
 – (DE)
 Mr President, Commissioners, ladies and gentlemen, sometimes, I ask myself what you actually take away from these debates with us after sitting here so patiently. Mr Barroso has gone, so it is too late to ask him. The Council is not here either, so the question is superfluous. However, as you are responsible for various areas of the Commission, I can ask you: what will you actually take away from this debate with the European Parliament on an unbelievably serious issue – one that will decide the fate of our populations in the Member States? I will tell you what I am taking away from it: I have a problem. Whenever your services give you reports of how we are not making any progress because growth continues to be in decline, of how employment is in the doldrums, then you get someone to write something about employment and how it can be increased through relatively non-binding measures. I have read it all a hundred times before. Over the past twelve years, I must have read what is written here a hundred times. However, those who commit this stuff to paper are sitting in your departments, Commissioner Rehn. What they actually believe is something different. They believe that we need to chase the countries of southern Europe through a structural recession. Those are the hard facts of the Stability and Growth Pact, those are the hard facts of the fiscal pact, and those are the hard facts of the erroneous expenditure policy. Until you resolve this contradiction and actually commit to paper some concrete measures for raising levels of investment again, the people will not understand you. I do not understand you either. (The speaker agreed to take a blue-card question under Rule 149(8)) Udo Bullmann  (S&amp;D

Blue-card answer.
 – (DE)
 Mr President, firstly, I would like to say to the questioner that the countries she mentions only have no problems on the surface. If you actually read the data on the Netherlands, you will see that growth is in decline there too. When Germans read the statistics, they actually know very well that they are very dependent on them. Things may appear to be going better again in the south, but this is only fleeting. On no account should we think that Germany can maintain its export rates in the long term without a functioning euro area. So my answer is yes; we need to arrive at a constellation in which demand in southern Europe is also boosted again. We need to create new jobs and sensible investment projects, and we need to use all the means at our disposal to ensure that we are not organising a recession that lasts 10 or 20 years. Udo Bullmann  (S&amp;D
). 
 – (DE)
 Mr President, the Council Presidency has told us that on 15 May, it will work towards a European mandate allowing the Commission to negotiate. I think that is a good thing. Rightly so. We will then be able to see how far the European Commission gets in its negotiations with Switzerland and others. It is also right, however, when honourable Members say that we should go for enhanced cooperation in areas where they can help us further. Yet you should ask sometime – you do, after all, have an audience for what you are doing – you should ask the German Government and the French Government why they have not been doing that for a long time already. Why is it that in their home countries, they always come out with fine words, but never actually take the initiative. That would be something. Please would you also publicly answer the question as to why the US is apparently far more successful in its bilateral efforts and is able to exert pressure far more successfully – on Switzerland, for example – than the German Government, rather than simply saying that what they are doing is fine. In the interests of our citizens, ask what the US is doing differently to European countries, so that we can make some practical progress at last. Udo Bullmann  (S&amp;D
).

 Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, this is the reality of economic development. The Italian economy began to grow at the beginning of the year and in Spain, the signs of growth are even clearer. The situation in Portugal is no better. There are even problems in the Netherlands and industrial order books are shrinking in Germany. Mr Barroso said before he left that we had had a useful discussion this morning. I am currently trying to work out what he meant by that. Mr Barroso and Mr Van Rompuy said ‘growth and employment’ around 10 to 15 times this morning, it is true. Has that changed anything or will it change anything? No! Repeating empty phrases will not result in any changes taking place. Therefore, I would like to know what is new about the way in which the European Council, the Member States and the Commission are dealing with the problem. Mr Barroso gave us one hint when he said that structural reforms must also involve social cohesion. It would be good if you could explain what you mean by that, because we have been arguing about it for quite some time. What do you mean by this? Do you agree with the idea proposed by Mr Swoboda and the Group of the Progressive Alliance of Socialists and Democrats in the European Parliament that all young people must have prospects for the future, but it is just a question of how we ensure this is the case? Do you want minimum wages in all European Member States which adapt dynamically to productivity and growth? Is that what you want? Then you say that growth is essential. Until now, your services have always denied that this had anything to do with investment, because you said that this only concerned structural reforms. This is why the memorandum of understanding in each individual case relating to this issue is so modest. Where is the investment channel that we argued about during the discussions on the ‘six-pack’? If you have nothing to say about investments, then you also have nothing to say about growth. The time for empty phrases has passed. We are waiting for an answer. (Applause) Udo Bullmann  (S&amp;D
),

 The Members of the European Parliament who belong to the Social Democratic Party of Germany (SPD) would very much have welcomed the introduction by the EU of compulsory contracts at the level of the Member States. However, the Council and the Commission were categorically opposed to this proposal. Nevertheless, the compromise that has been reached allows milk producers throughout Europe to join together in producer organisations. It is of crucial importance for us to ensure that milk producers are put in a stronger position in their negotiations with dairies and retailers. Alongside compulsory contracts, we also strongly supported larger size limits for associations of producer organisations, because that would have further improved the negotiating position of milk producers in Europe. It became clear in this part of the trialogue negotiations that the Council would not have been prepared to accept this, even in the course of a further reading. The opportunity to join together in producer organisations is not a new one for German milk producers because this option is already open to them at a national level as a result of the German Market Structure Act. Given that it was not possible to achieve a better result in the face of opposition from the Council and the Commission, it was all the more important for us to ensure that the interests of small and medium-sized milk producers are taken into consideration in the forthcoming reform of the common agricultural policy (CAP). Conditions must be laid down in the CAP which enable these businesses to continue producing milk even in less favourable regions. This is the only way that we can meet our main requirement, which is to guarantee the existence of a sustainable and multifunctional agricultural industry throughout the whole of Europe. Udo Bullmann  (S&amp;D

 Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, let us take a quick look at the harsh economic reality. On the day of the summit, the markets rated Portuguese debt securities for 10-year bonds at 17% interest and for five-year bonds at 20% interest. So much for the question as to the extent to which the summit has helped to calm the economic situation, or the question of to what degree the new intergovernmental treaty has pacified activity on the market. If anyone asks himself where the disquiet is coming from, then perhaps the answer is from the economic data and from the feeling that what we have done is not enough. President Schulz, I would like to thank you expressly for the courage and clarity with which you participated in this summit on behalf of this House in order to say that we will indeed defend the Community method and we certainly want consolidation, but we also need to invest so that Europe’s economies can flourish. I believe that this is a line that this House will be able to agree on, and we will be able to continue to develop a common economic policy. Udo Bullmann  (S&amp;D
). 
 – (DE) 
Madam President, as the coordinator for the Group of the Progressive Alliance of Socialists and Democrats in the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs, I can confirm that Mr Schwab has tabled an excellent proposal that can be supported by all sides of the House, and would encourage others to follow our lead in supporting it. Udo Bullmann  (S&amp;D
). 
 – (DE)
 Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, what does the result of the summit bring us? With regard to the automatic sanctions, I would simply like you to explain, gentlemen, what happens when a country has more than 3% debt in future and you want to apply automatic sanctions, but the country says that Article 126 and the current Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union apply. What will happen then? Then our finest hour, which Mr Lambsdorff has spoken about, will turn out not to have been so fine after all. It is a fake which is not worth the paper it is written on, because it does not change the real situation. In legal terms, what have you actually done? As far as the economy goes, research institutes are saying that in the next two years, perhaps four of the 17 euro area countries will be in a position to achieve the structural deficit target that you have imposed. Possibly by 2015, but only if we can avoid a recession. However, if we take your route, without a growth initiative, we will find ourselves in the midst of a recession. It is a mistake to believe that we can achieve these targets without additional programmes for growth. How will we do it? What have you decided? Without the European Parliament, you will not be able to get out of the mess that you have got yourselves into. Take the opportunity to sit down at the table with the European Parliament and then you will still have a chance. Otherwise, you will find that there are no cards left on the table. (Applause) Udo Bullmann  (S&amp;D

 – (DE)
 Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, we all trust that Mr Daul is right when he says that we are hopefully beginning to see the light at the end of the tunnel in this crisis. The litmus test for this question, however, is not to be found in today’s newspaper headlines, but rather in the economic developments of the coming weeks and months. Paragraph 3 of the resolution states: ‘The European Union must improve its prospects for growth and employment.’ This is absolutely correct. A question last night’s document did not answer, however, is the issue of what is to be done in order to improve the prospects for growth and employment. Much later, in paragraph 25, there is an indication of the intent to work out an appropriate strategy. I hope that this will happen. One thing is clear, however, President of the Commission and President-in-Office of the Council: a strategy of cuts without investment will not see us through this crisis. We are already in a state of stagnation and the threat of recession is not far away. Mr Barroso, this will come at a high cost for the people you have referred to, who are at the receiving end of this series of bad decisions, and who will find themselves with no jobs and no income. That is the reason for my question today: When, Mr Van Rompuy, do you intend coming to this House with these proposals so that they can be approved by Parliament? After all, you said yourself that it is a matter for this House to discuss economic policy with you. We must assume responsibility here in a situation where you are obviously ready to curtail the responsibilities of the national parliaments. That is our present task. We would like to hear your answer. Udo Bullmann  (S&amp;D
). 
 – (DE)
 Mr President, President of the Commission, Commissioner, President-in-Office of the Council, there are two questions that remain unanswered in this debate. The first is that, when we read what the World Bank says, when we read what Ms Lagarde at the International Monetary Fund says, it would seem that we are on the brink of a recession. The growth engines have failed. Where are the investments? That is the urgent question for the European Union. I would like to ask you: you refer to the Stability and Growth Pact – where are the investments? You wanted to cut everything do with investments. So, where are the investments? Where can we cooperate so that we can move forward in Europe once again? We Social Democrats are willing to help in finding a strategy that will allow us to move forward. The second question is this: how can we enter into a common bond market? Here, too, you can be sure of our support. Please put forward proposals. Help to convince those in the Council who are still not convinced. We will help you do this, and we would seek the support of the majority in this House. Udo Bullmann  (S&amp;D
).  
– (DE)
 Mr President, I should like to begin my comments with a question to Commissioner Rehn and to Mr Kármán of the Council. Both have spoken of an outstanding matter in the argument between the parliamentary majority and the Council. This week I noted that the Council had opposed text in the report by Mrs Ferreira, the rapporteur for the Group of the Progressive Alliance of Socialists and Democrats in the European Parliament, concerning the symmetrical approach. Are you able to tell me that this problem has been resolved, because the Council voted in favour of the rapporteur? In actual fact, you would then still have a problem between the majority here and the Council – or did you forget to mention that? If so, I should like to know that too, because then I would think that you consider it unimportant. I should like the two of you to explain this to me at the end of this debate. Listening to the two conservative groups in this House, and also to the liberals, I get the impression that if we adopt what they have tabled here then the world will be put to rights. Unfortunately, that is not the case. The world would subsequently be worse, not better – because they have turned an opportunity to create a more common economic policy in Europe into an austerity package. That is a bad thing, because it represents a policy that dates from the last century, because it represents an outdated approach which merely takes sanctions regimes from political techniques and not incentives, or smart taxation, or balanced approaches such as have been represented by us. Various sides of the House have made sufficient pragmatic proposals to allow a balanced package to be tabled. If Mrs Wortmann-Kool wants to claim that it would be blocked by the greens and the social democrats, that is of course simply nonsense. Exactly the opposite is true. To the Members of this House from the Group of the European People’s Party (Christian Democrats) – who run after either the Commission or the Council – I would state that we are not here to let things through on the nod, but rather to think for ourselves. That is what the voters expect of us. I must therefore point out to you that at present you cannot tell whether a Member State is buying defence hardware, fighter aircraft or investing in its education system of tomorrow. You are not in a position to make a qualitative assessment of its budgetary policy. We do, in fact, want to equip you to do so. We wanted a smarter pact which provides greater opportunity for the Commission to have an influence. I cannot understand why Commissioner Rehn is not agreeing to this – more opportunities for influence and a modern economic policy which makes reference to the EU2020 objectives in the interests of our citizens. You have derailed it, and that is a pity. Consequently, this package is by no means balanced. We will continue to fight for a better economic package. We owe this to our electorate. In truth, the answer has to be ‘more Europe’, not ‘less Europe’. It has to be the right Europe, however – not the wrong package. Udo Bullmann  (S&amp;D
). 
 – (DE)
 Mr President, Mr Langen, I just want to make sure that you are familiar with our ideas. I am therefore asking you whether you are aware of what we proposed to your colleague, Mrs Wortmann-Kool, which was firstly that we strengthen the pact by including closer monitoring of selected objectives proposed by Mr Rehn from the EU2020 package, such as research and development and the fight against poverty. This would also include investment in modernising energy supply systems. Udo Bullmann  (S&amp;D
). 
 – (DE) 
Madam President, the Council and Commission are quite right when they suggest that the public budgets in Europe need to be consolidated. However, if we look at how this works and how it will continue to work in the future, then it is evident that the wrong people are being affected. Schools are being closed, teachers are losing their jobs, researchers are finding themselves out on the street and public investments are being cut or left to stagnate. I would like to ask Mr Van Rompuy and Mr Barroso: Is this your intention? Of course you will say that this is not what you want and that other areas are to be cut back. My question then is: Where are the cuts to be made? My key question is as follows: If you believe that the cuts should be made elsewhere, then why is it that the draft that you propose for decision making in the ‘six-pack’ for economic governance makes no distinction as to whether a country purchases tanks or weapons of war or invests in an ailing national economy, or whether it makes an investment in the future? Or perhaps whether it invests in a modern energy supply system and in the education and training of its children? Romano Prodi once famously said that these drafts are stupid. His words are still true because this distinction between good and bad investments cannot be made. Our only choice is to improve these drafts, because Europe cannot be governed sensibly if such distinctions are beyond us. My last question is: Where is the income to be found that will enable us to move forward out of the crisis? After all, we cannot just save our way out of the problem. Mr Barroso, we await your proposal on the financial transaction tax in Europe, something that this House has backed with a large majority. Give Europe a chance and avoid wasting any more time with pious words. Udo Bullmann,  
on behalf of the S&amp;D Group. 
– (DE)
 Mr President, I am sorry, Mr Šemeta, but what you are presenting is not enough. It is months since Parliament gave you the job of investigating what action we can take, including in respect of a financial transaction tax; we gave you the job here in this House. You have not done this. What we know of your position – which has been presented in writing by the Commission on more than one occasion – is something different. You want us to tax the small financial service providers: those that still maintain branches, that care about their customers, that care about medium-sized businesses, that ensure business credit is still available. The parties you do not want to tax are the speculators: those who shift millions and billions around the globe with their high frequency trading, thereby ensuring that our economy is unpredictable – unpredictable even to good entrepreneurs and good investors who want to create decent jobs for the future. Your position is therefore unsatisfactory and consequently, this House must find its own voice. I am sorry to say that Mr Gauzès – whom I otherwise hold in very high esteem – is wrong on this occasion. He is wrong because he is watering down the position adopted by this House previously in the Berès report. Anyone who votes in favour of Mr Gauzès’s proposal will be ensuring that the Commission does what it wants to do anyway – namely, proposes no financial transaction tax. That will be the result of agreeing with Mr Gauzès. That is why it would be wrong to agree with him in this instance. Anyone who wants to give this House a voice, who wants to win back trust, who wants to ensure that the citizens of Europe can once again look to our institutions with hope and a belief that we are doing something to deal with the crises must, in this instance, vote in favour of the alternative motion tabled by the Group of the Progressive Alliance of Socialists and Democrats in the European Parliament and must vote in favour of Amendment 2, which has been endorsed by more than 120 Members of this House from all the major groups. Thank you for your support. Udo Bullmann  (S&amp;D

 Mr President, on behalf of my group I would like to table an oral amendment to strengthen equal opportunities and the aspect of gender policy in the Europe 2020 Strategy. I will read the text out in English – new paragraph 10 a:   ‘Insists that gender equality is a key target for achievement of the ambitions of EU 2020. Calls therefore for the full participation of women in the labour market and the full inclusion of female workers in vocational training. Calls also for an agenda to eradicate the pay gap that exists between women and men.’ (Applause) Udo Bullmann,  
on behalf of the S&amp;D Group. 
– (DE)
 Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, Commissioner, President-in-Office of the Council, I have listened closely to what you have said, I have read the Annual Growth Survey, I have read the Ecofin conclusions and now I am absolutely clear about one thing: the European Union is not only experiencing an economic crisis, it is also experiencing a political crisis. What you are recommending to us is nothing new. Ask your staff to show you the documents from the last ten years. The same thing can be seen in all of them, namely that public expenditure is too high, and the only mechanism for adjustment to new times relates to wages and they are always too high. I have not seen any other recommendations. Whether it is raining or snowing, whether we are in a crisis or a boom – it is always the same ideology, but it has nothing whatsoever to do with empirical economic reality. Allow me to suggest something to you: send those people who write these things for you, who carry out the economic analyses in the Council and the Commission, to the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs sometime. We want to get to know your economic models. We want to discuss with them whether they do not see that Europe is on the brink of recession. Remove the German export rates and the German growth rates for example and then you will see what I am talking about. I will then ask you why there is not a single word about investments – when we have lowest level of investment so far, which we ourselves can no longer afford – why there is not a single word about improvements in revenue and nothing about following the cycles or about the fact that we must finally learn to grow together or how we will get out of the crisis. There is nothing about any of these things in your documents. You missed the start of this year, and you will have to make a great effort to meet the expectations of citizens in Europe. However, let me tell you something: if this is the spirit in which you intend to take a decision in March concerning the cconomic governance package and the reform of the Stability and Growth Pact, my group will be unable to be involved in this. Udo Bullmann,  
on behalf of the S&amp;D Group.

Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, why are we here? Mr Barnier said that we are here because the European Parliament has succeeded in establishing European supervisory authorities that are worthy of the name. That was not part of the Council’s programme. It was not part of the Member States’ programme. The Commission, too, had doubts about how long we would actually persevere with regard to the establishment of this new institution. The Council will understand – it will have to understand – and the Commission will, too – possibly even of its own accord – why we are concerned. No, this European Parliament – and this is a statement that I find applies to all party groups, not just to us as Social Democrats – will not allow national games to be played that undermine the powers of these new supervisory authorities. That is why we are interested in the appointment of staff, of course. We have rights in this regard – we have to be consulted. There are one or two things that in fact give us cause for concern. We receive lists of individuals and we receive lists, which when we look at we cannot actually tell whether a gender criterion has been applied. We are given proposals for candidates, which when we consider – and I say this with all due respect to the people concerned – we do not see anyone that we believe could not do a decent job. These are clearly good people who have already shown in their jobs that they can do their work well, but the people that have been presented to us are not people who, on the basis of any authority that they may have demonstrated in their past work, can actually say to the national supervisory authorities where they would stand in the event of a conflict. Where there is European supervision, national momentum comes to a standstill. That surprises and annoys us, and it must call us into action. No, these procedures are unsatisfactory, and I ask myself why, for example, we cannot take the same approach as we are taking with regard to those responsible for OLAF, where you are of course interested in the opinion of this House. Why can we not do that? We still have another opportunity with regard to the executive directors. You can still demonstrate that you are interested in the opinion of the European Parliament. You still have another opportunity. I would urge you both – President-in-Office of the Council and former fellow Member Mrs Győri and Commissioner Barnier, to take this opportunity. You can take on board the objections of this House. You can tell us very clearly how you want to work with us in future. You can tell us very clearly what goals you will support in the 2013 reform and how you will equip the institutions. You will also be able to make it very clear whether you are interested in our opinion in respect of those members of staff that are still to be appointed. I therefore ask you in all earnestness in the interests of Europe to provide these rules quickly. Udo Bullmann  (S&amp;D

 Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, in critical situations, Europe has always found a way out of a crisis. Not because different interests have been played off against one another, but because we have combined our interests, which has allowed us to take new paths. I would have liked to ask Mr Barroso a question, but unfortunately he is no longer here. There will, of course, soon be important press conferences on the subject of how we can rescue Europe using the lowest common denominator, but Mr Rehn may be able to pass my question on. I do not understand why we are not taking the following route. Eurobonds are a sensible solution. Mr Schulz has said that on behalf of our group and, in Germany, where this is a critical issue, my party is saying the same thing. The German Government in particular has reservations and there are also reservations in other countries which are paying less interest. Why do we not proceed as follows? We are saying that these problems can be solved. We are now planning to launch eurobonds, but we are putting together a sensible package. What do we need to enable Europe to act? How can we put money into the coffers? How can we create more taxation potential for a sensible, long-term economy? We are launching eurobonds and we are linking this launch with the introduction of the financial transaction tax in the European Union. This package could result in a win-win situation, which would enable everyone to benefit. Ask Mrs Merkel at the European summit if she is prepared to do this. Why is it not possible? Why does the Commission not make a proposal of this kind? It would help everyone and enable a major new project for Europe to emerge from the crisis. I am waiting for the Commission to make this proposal. You must stop trying to talk your way out of it. It is time for you to act in the interest of the citizens of Europe and in the interest of the Member States, so that we can find our way back to a sensible path of growth. Our fate is in your hands, but you must have the courage to take the initiative now. Udo Bullmann,

 Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, in her speech this morning, Mrs Harms posed the question of why the spark is no longer being passed from the summits to the people and why new courage and new confidence is not emanating from the summit discussions. As I listened to you this morning and also just now, Mr Barroso, and to Mr Van Rompuy or the Council, too, I got an idea of why the spark is not being passed on. The spark is not even passing into the Chamber here – just look around you. Of course, it is important for more Members to be here. Why are they not here? It is wrong for them not to be here. However, they are not really hearing anything new anyway. You are telling us things that have already been said in the newspapers many times and you are not providing answers to the very pointed questions that have been asked. What is happening with regard to the financial transaction tax? Mr Schulz has asked about this many times. Where is the answer? It is not on the agenda of the G20 summit in Seoul. I would like an explanation. I would also like to know why the European Council, the Belgian Presidency, said that it is in favour of this, but why the European Council at its last three summits merely said that it recommended a feasibility study at global level but not at European level. Why ever not? Does the Council not see the dead end into which you are directing this matter? I will ask you once again, Mr Barroso: when will Mr Šemeta comply with the demand made by this Parliament at the beginning of this year, namely that we want a feasibility study for Europe, too? If you present an opinion on this subject, this Chamber will actually be full and we will listen to you. However, do not avoid the issue any longer. For Europe alone we are talking about EUR 200 billion per year. Ask the Members who belong to the Committee on Budgets what trivial, small amounts they are currently arguing about with the Council. With an initiative we would make progress. We need to breathe life into the roles, then the spark will once again be passed on. That is what we expect from you. Udo Bullmann  (S&amp;D

 Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, as I listen to this debate, I have to admit that it reminds me very much of the debate on the Services Directive. I will tell you why. In that case, too, my fellow Members from the Group of the Greens/European Free Alliance and the Confederal Group of the European United Left – Nordic Green Left declared that there was a regulation on the table in this House that was not perfect, not complete, and yet for years now, they have been grateful for the fact that the Group of the Progressive Alliance of Socialists and Democrats in the European Parliament managed to push it through in this House. That is the truth about this regulation that we will vote on tomorrow. In fact, the improvement made on what the Council and Commission proposed can essentially be attributed to Mr Goebbels and Mrs Regner, who fought for improvements here against the opposition, with the support and excellent cooperation of Mr Gauzès, for which I would like to thank him. In my country, Germany, what we have agreed here for the private equity industry will bring about real improvements for workers and for small and medium-sized enterprises, which no longer need to be afraid of simply being eaten up by the black sheep of the equity industry that do not abide by any standards. These days, when we read and listen to the press telling us that the funds industry is moving its focus away from the Caribbean and towards Europe because it is important to long-term investors that there are good products in which to invest, that supports the work of this Parliament rather than running counter to it. However, before we talk too much about dynamism here, I have to say that my group has been calling for a regulation since 2002. Perhaps there has been evidence of dynamism, but only in the last few weeks. I would like to thank the President-in-Office of the Council and the Commissioner, as you have personally supplied this dynamism. Please tell your colleagues in the Council that, with this method of sluggishness, of ‘yes, but’ and the refusal to put through better regulations in Europe, we will not succeed in getting the next pieces of legislation on derivatives or short selling through. This situation has to change. That is an appeal from this Parliament. Udo Bullmann  (S&amp;D

 Mr President, Mr Chastel, Commissioner, this could actually have been a time of great answers, but in hindsight, it does not look like it. What is on the table for the so-called reform of the Stability and Growth Pact is no great answer; once again, it is the lowest common denominator – the small morsel that could actually be agreed upon. I congratulate the Commission. You are still at the table – the Member States are not quite going it alone. I also congratulate the Council. Success has been achieved, France and Germany have an agreement – we do not know whether it is a good one or a bad one, but at least they are no longer stuck in the quagmire. What does all this mean? It means that next year, if the growth figures collapse again, we will stand up in front of everyone and have no answer to the economic situation. Where is the section, the legal statute, in which you propose how we can together learn to drag ourselves out of the debt crisis? That is where my group feels there is a gap and that is the debate that we are going to have in this House. Yes, we agree with those Members who want greater commitment to reform. That is something that we want too. However, we then need to discuss the substance. If you are not prepared to provide a more solid foundation for the actual orientation of our budgetary policy, then we can see no reason to continue discussing EU 2020. It is already a paper tiger – we can throw it in the waste paper basket today if you will not debate the substance of it with us more forcefully. We want to make a difference. Yes, it makes a difference whether we invest in limping bureaucracy or in the energy sources and jobs of the future. Where is the point in your proposals where we can make this difference? That is what we are waiting for. This debate has yet to take place. That will be the decisive thing for us. Moreover, we will not accept a catalogue of indicators that is based on the legislation. This Parliament will not have the wool pulled over its eyes. We want to debate whether employment and unemployment are an important feature of budgetary development or not, and we want to do so before the legislation is passed. Udo Bullmann,  
on behalf of the S&amp;D Group.

 Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, let me just point one thing out before I start. The Basel Committee is a group of more or less intelligent central bankers and overseers, but it is certainly no infallible council of wise men and it is definitely not the law. This House is the legislative body – Commissioner, you know that, and we know that you do – and this legislative body will pay close attention to what is put on the table and, where it makes sense, to what is put on the table here, too. Clearly, we do want the rules on capital requirements to be tightened up. How could we not want that, in the wake of the economic crisis in which we still find ourselves? 20 to 30% of the gross national product of our national economies are in pawn as the rescue package for the banks. The people expect us, of course, to make respectable banking rules so that we do not find ourselves in a crisis like this one again. Clearly, we want there to be counter-cyclical elements in this banking safeguard like those, for example, that have already been proving their worth in Spain for years. Although there, too, they had to be implemented in the face of opposition, they are paying off today because they were implemented at an appropriately early point and they did not make the banking system worse; they made it more robust. There are key issues, though, and I am truly grateful to the rapporteur, Mr Karas, for having put these key issues at the heart of his own-initiative report, which we find ourselves absolutely and totally able to support. The first of these is that, yes, indeed, we do need an impact study, specifically a complex impact study that makes it clear what the impact is, for one thing, on the financial sector in all its parts but also, of course, in particular, what the impact is on the real economy. What is the impact on the issue of what the future actually holds for loan financing conditions for small and medium-sized enterprises? The second issue is that we need the certainty that this time, unlike in the past, the agreements will also be implemented in other territories. We need to know that before we legislate, as otherwise there will be a new asymmetry for which we cannot be responsible. The third issue is that there can be no discrimination in terms of legal forms. Those forms among the diversity of the European banking system that particularly proved themselves during the financial crisis – and that means those banks that looked after the small and medium-sized business sector and those banks that were focusing on private customers and thus did not elicit cross-border risks – must not be penalised for the solidarity of their establishment. The proposal on the table at the moment does not do enough to ensure this. We therefore believe that the proposals need to now be improved and that we need to consider how we can tackle this issue in practical terms. Public banking overall is of major value, provided it can be run on a sensible basis. We do also need to ask – and I am thinking here about silent partnership reserves – how this will actually be effected in future, if we buy the regulations as they are envisaged in Basel. This cannot be the last word, nor is it the final version that we will accept. The capital instruments need to be measured in order to see the extent to which they ensure consistent quality without false provisos, are available to absorb losses, are durable and flexible in terms of payment, as the rapporteur also argues in his report. It is a reasonable starting position for us to take. We want the leverage effects to be limited and reasonable allowance to be made for the different risk profiles. We will examine your proposal, therefore, Commissioner, and we hope for the best of cooperation with Parliament. Udo Bullmann,  
on behalf of the S&amp;D Group.

Madam President, Mr Reynders, Commissioner, congratulations on your supervision. Parliament has worked hard on this issue and you have also played your part, which is why the results are so good. We must always look to new tasks and, unfortunately, I must point out that good results are still a long way off in other areas. Let me just say that the regulation of hedge fund managers is still nowhere near a breakthrough. At this point, I would call on both sides, both the Council and the Commission, to get cracking. After all, without your efforts, the regulations will not be of much use. We need equal rights for all. Managers outside the European Union must always be subject to the same conditions as their European counterparts. Otherwise, we are putting Europe at a disadvantage. It is not our aim to put a whole industry behind bars. However, if we do not achieve meaningful improvements that will prevent the black sheep from plundering well-functioning businesses, we are not going to have good regulation. I want to issue this warning: you should not imagine that you will score an easy victory by simply playing the various Members of this House off against each other. If you fail to introduce effective regulation, the whole of Europe will know who it was who went down on bended knee before the lobbyists and that knowledge will give these discussions a different character. A word about the financial transaction tax: My view of this is diametrically opposed to that of the Group of the European People’s Party (Christian Democrats). Europe is waiting for answers. You will have to provide these answers. Do not come back from the G20 summit and tell us: ‘Unfortunately we have achieved nothing, so now there is nothing we can do.’ On the contrary, we need to take action in Europe, which is why we need to plan and implement some decisive measures together with the people in Europe. Remember one thing during your negotiations at the G20 summit: we need a response from you, otherwise there is going to have to be a European response. Udo Bullmann  (S&amp;D

Madam President, as the coordinator for the Group of the Progressive Alliance of Socialists and Democrats in the European Parliament, I would like to make a comment on Amendment 6. I would like to call on my group to vote in favour of Amendment 6, in contrast to what appears on our voting recommendations. This is a mistake in the list. We should vote for Amendment 6 and this is likely to clarify the way in which we will vote now in a decisive situation. Udo Bullmann  (S&amp;D

 Mr President, Mr López Garrido, ladies and gentlemen, I would like to ask you to pass on a message to the other members of the Council. The time for the policy of excuses is over. It is important that you do not decide tomorrow that Parliament should adopt the supervisory package and the hedge funds package more quickly as part of the regulation of the financial markets, while the Council – and I do not mean you personally, Mr López Garrido, but I want to encourage you to help us – simultaneously puts on the brakes and prevents us from finding solutions. The trialogue of the Council, the Commission and Parliament is meeting in this House at the same time to discuss the issue of regulating hedge funds. We have proposed appropriate regulations, which prevent the finance industry from gobbling up industrial firms using speculative funds and bringing the real economy to its knees. However, the Council is blocking these regulations. Please tell the Heads of State or Government that the time for the policy of excuses is long gone. It is no longer acceptable for them to give big speeches at home about the regulations that Europe can introduce and then to chicken out when their officials begin working at a European level. The time for this is past and we can no longer afford to behave in this way in the context of the economic crisis. I would like to ask you the same question, Mr Barroso. It does not matter whether you are mentioning the word ‘growth’ here for the 49th, 52nd or 64th time. It is much more important for you to explain why it is that, as the Economic and Financial Affairs Council (Ecofin) stated the day before yesterday, the Member States of the European Union will have to make huge cuts amounting to 3.5% of their gross national product, but you are not telling us how you will use this money to prevent a dreadful catastrophe on the labour market. In this situation, we must learn to grow together. However, you need to explain how this will happen. Otherwise, the Europe 2020 strategy will not be worth the paper it is written on. We need real answers instead of fictitious answers and excuses in order to ensure that the institutions which you represent are part of the solution and not part of the problem. Udo Bullmann  (S&amp;D

 Mr President, Mr López Garrido, ladies and gentlemen, I have a very specific question which will allow us to emerge from the position of powerlessness and confusion that the crisis has left us in, with no one knowing how the crisis arose and how we can find our way out of it. Mr Schulz has referred to the highly critical speculative products and credit default insurance and to the damaging practice of short selling, which brought Greece to the brink of disaster and could represent a major problem for Portugal and many other countries. Mr López Garrido, you have frequently attended the Economic and Financial Affairs Council (Ecofin) in recent months, why was it not possible for the Member States to take concerted action to ban these products? I have been asking this question in the capital of my own country over recent weeks and months and it has taken you months, in fact until yesterday evening, to introduce a ban on the damaging practice of short selling. I ask myself why we have to wait until things have gone wrong before making use of the appropriate legislative measures, which are already in place, to protect the people and the economies of Europe. I believe it has something to do with the Council’s dreadful, discouraging slowness to act, which you have referred to. I will make a deal with you. We in the European Parliament are presenting concrete proposals. In the context of regulating the supervisory bodies and the discussion about hedge funds, we have proposed that we should take appropriate measures on a European level and we will make the same resolution on derivatives, if you, Mr Langen, do what you are always saying. We are calling on you urgently to ensure that the Council finally begins to work with us to put in place legislation so that we in Europe are able to act and no longer have to wait for ever for the Council to make a move. We need to have the tools at our disposal in Europe to enable us to make progress. Please help to make sure that this happens in the Council. However, the decisive point is that the Council must take action on the legislation. Udo Bullmann  (S&amp;D
).

 Madam President, Mr Hökmark, I think we have been in different parliaments in recent years, because the parliament I have experienced is different to yours! I have experienced a parliament in which some say we must look more closely into ratings agencies, hedge funds and private equity corporations. We must regulate them, we must carry out checks on the critical players in the financial markets and the critical products to ensure that we are not veering towards an international fiasco. I have also heard others saying ‘hands off’: the market will regulate itself, we do not need all that. Or as Mr McCreevy said – whenever politics interferes, the result is always worse. We have seen the results. The international fiasco is the cause of the overindebtedness of the Member States of the European Union. However, we cannot stand here today and say that it was wrong to focus our growth policy on employment and economic activity. It is irrelevant to the debate, just as it is irrelevant to the debate when Mr Langen says that Chancellor Merkel understood the European Treaty. No, she did not understand it at all. What is worse, she is probably in a position to subordinate the European Treaty and its aims for Europe to her fear of losing an important regional election in North Rhine-Westphalia. These are not the leadership skills that we need in the European Union. We have told the Commission here that EU 2020 is too watered down. There is no meat in it. Please provide some evidence that you are able to acquire new funds. Please fight for a financial transactions tax. Please fight for more economic activity and greater growth prospects in the European Union, to give small and medium-sized enterprises and the workers a chance. Right now, however, we almost sympathise with you for having to save the European Union with governments such as we have at present – governments such as that represented by Chancellor Merkel. Stay strong and create European instruments! That is our main message for the summit, because only then can people hope that we will provide the right answers. Udo Bullmann,

Mr President, Commissioner, I would like to chip in with a few questions on what Mr Scicluna has stated on behalf of the Committee. Commissioner, if there are 70, 80, 90 or 100 times as many financial transactions in the world as gross national product, and if this development is becoming ever more dynamic, would you then say speculative elements are, for the greater part, linked to this explosion of financial products? If so, how do you then plan to curb them, or what might contribute to curbing them? If short-term financial transactions increase more and more relative to gross national product in the world, do you then share our view that we must strengthen the long-term approach in the real economy, where people work, earn money and manufacture products that we can consume and that we can use. If you share this opinion, by what way and means do you believe will we then be able to achieve this? Commissioner, if the tax on financial transactions can make a contribution to this – that is what we want to look into – what would the timeframe be for negotiating this with international partners? We have the impression that the financial instruments that were created in the world are being used right now to speculate against the euro area and against the euro and to act against the weakest Member States. Is it not high time now that we dealt with this and define a European approach? Commissioner, there is one thing I cannot understand, namely why we are urging Member States to raise value added tax by three or four or more percentage points, when a transaction tax of 0.01 or 0.05 percentage points will supposedly ruin competition and weaken Europe’s position. I cannot believe that. Take action. That is what Parliament wishes. Udo Bullmann,

Mr President, Commissioner, the Single Euro Payments Area is an important, indeed central, instrument of the European single market. It is thanks to Mr Gauzès that we have got it off the ground. My group is fully behind it and would like to see it working well. I personally also have nothing against us setting a deadline for the migration, and here to me it is not so much a question of whether it takes three, four or five months as the fact that it then actually works. Whether it actually works depends on two things. Firstly the appeal to industry that it must be end-user friendly. These days, we cannot afford any rumours, any secret resistance, any hankering after the old system. Therefore, it must be functioning properly, also in respect of those who ultimately have to use it. Secondly, it must, of course, also work for the benefit of the economy. Here I would like to mention one point, which is still a bone of contention, namely the matter of how direct debits will be calculated. Here, the economy does not yet seem to be in a position to propose a sensible model. There are still snags, there are still sticking points and if the economy is not in a position to present a common model that works within the European Union, then the Commission – as stipulated in this proposal for a resolution – must present a concrete proposal within a certain period of time, let us say before the end of the year. It should not be the case that we confront the economy and demand a deadline for the migration, but do not take the initiative to remove the resistance that the payment service providers are obviously not in the position to overcome single-handedly. We need a community initiative here, so the whole thing can work. That is our approach to the discussion. Udo Bullmann  (S&amp;D
).

 Madam President, President of the European Council, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, I would like to briefly address two points. Firstly, do we already have a Europe 2020 strategy that promises success? No, as yet, we do not. I will tell you why. If, in the Commission and the Member States, you say that we will first carry out a rapid consolidation of the budgets and then deal with the economy and employment, then this is a miscalculation. If you do not believe us, read the statement issued by the International Monetary Fund yesterday. Private sector demand is a long way from recovery. We are concerned about public investment. If you do not pursue an integrated strategy with specific employment goals at the centre, we will have no chance of dealing with the crisis. Secondly, do we have an answer to the debt crisis in the countries that are under the most pressure? No, as yet we do not. More than one country has made mistakes. However, if you read the data carefully and listen to the analysts, then you know that at least half of the Greek excesses are the fault of speculators – the speculators that, for five years, the Commission did not want to regulate – the hedge funds. Now we are finally doing that, but what does it actually mean in practice? We need a European monetary fund, a fund to help these countries. We need to be able to offer credit at sensible rates not only outside the euro area, but within it, too, with conditions attached. However, we need to establish a European policy to solve the crisis – and we need to do so now. Udo Bullmann,  
on behalf of the S&amp;D Group.

Madam President, Mr Almunia, during this transition period in particular, I thank you for your commitment to your previous mandate and I wish you luck in your new role. I would also like to extend this wish to your successor, Mr Rehn. I wish him courage and luck for the important tasks he is taking on. There are three things we can learn from the present situation. The first is that what Mr Barroso has presented to us as Europe 2020 is lacking in substance. It is a long way from being sufficient to create the coherence in the European Union that we urgently need in order to prevent the situation that we are currently facing from occurring again in the future. This strategy needs substance, and I hope that the scheduled milestones in the next few weeks will provide the opportunity to improve on it. We urgently need better coordination of economic policy. The Spanish Presidency is right to emphasise this. The Presidency should not allow itself to be intimidated in this regard. The second thing we can learn from the current situation is that some Member States are, of course, in need of modernisation and the figures are surely correct in this regard. However, there is a need for modernisation in more than one country. There are also countries that have to do more, because they are able to do more. I have no doubt that the new Greek Finance Minister, Mr Papakonstantinou, will do an excellent job and I do not know any sincere politicians who would dispute that. He deserves our trust and we should give him our support. The third thing we can learn is that the European Union must be armed. If the markets put the euro area to the test, then Europe must be a position to respond to this and it must be possible for the response to be unconventional. If there is further speculation against individual countries, we must be in a position to make credit available under average European rating terms. That will need to be organised. We can find support for this kind of action in the Treaty of Lisbon. I would say to the Council and the Commission: be prepared for the need to negotiate. Udo Bullmann  (S&amp;D
).

 Mr President, even as we today congratulate Mrs Alvarez, Mr Domenici and our other fellow members on their excellent reports, even as we congratulate Commissioner Kovács on his committed work and wish him all the best with his future work, and even as we express the hope that he will pass on to his successor the passion with which he has fought for a common tax policy, we must also then mention Member States, those Member States who continue to hesitate in taking action that is more than necessary in this crisis situation, action which will finally usher in better cooperation. It is quite shocking that we still have not made any breakthrough on the question of the tax base. Anyone who thinks that they will be able to defend their sovereignty in this way will lose it, just as they will lose their tax revenue. Therefore, the main message of these reports is that we must forge better cooperation in Europe. Only that will lead to progress! Udo Bullmann,  
on behalf of the S&amp;D Group. 
– (DE) 
Mr President, President-in-Office of the Council, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, first and foremost, there can be no ‘as you were’ in the current economic situation. That will only allow us to make a slow recovery and we shall see a further dramatic increase in unemployment figures, including here in Europe. You must therefore be bold. That is the most important message this Parliament can give the Pittsburgh delegates. Be bold! Mr Almunia, I have listened to a refreshing speech from you, on which I should like to congratulate you. Now you need to start putting it into practice. It is good to start with the bonus systems, but it is not enough. We need a gear shift wherever short-term speculators are at an advantage on the international financial market, because the rules are wrong, over those who wish to make long-term investments in jobs, in products of excellence and in the long-term success of their company. It is right to say that no risky players, no risky financial centre can remain without reasonable regulation, which is why we need regulation of the offshore centres from which dubious products are flooding the entire world. That is the most important task that we must now set ourselves. Nor should you be frightened of discussing fiscal policy – it is not prohibited. A global transaction tax which benefits long-term investors would take us forward in this discussion as a whole. We need strong, improved coordination of our international, as well as our European, economic policy. It is right to think about an exit strategy, but it is even more important at the moment that we work out how we can give more solid support to the economy and improve the coordination of our economic policy. Udo Bullmann,  
on behalf of the S&amp;D Group.

 Mr President, Commissioners, ladies and gentlemen, in this situation, where, after a struggle that has gone on for months, the way is finally open to a solution in which, of the in excess of 50 000 directly-affected jobs, probably – at least according to what the new investors are telling us – around 40 000 can be saved, not counting the many jobs amongst suppliers and in dependent local businesses, it is now time to address the workforce of General Motors in Europe. It was their dispute, they – Klaus Franz as the Chairman of the Full Works Council and all the others – became the face of Opel Europe, from a new technology group that has earned its opportunity, and in such a situation, our policy must help. What is it that we are discussing? We are discussing how General Motors in the US staggered on for months. It came within a whisker – and we know this for certain, ladies and gentlemen – of failing. What, then, could have been more reasonable than to have seized the initiative, moved forwards and said, ‘OK then. We have to jump in here and give people a chance. We must give not just the production sites, but also the future technologies, a chance so that Europe can remain a good place to produce cars.’ I can fully identify with the outlook that Commissioner Špidla set out for the European car industry. Let us make it real! Let us create an industrial policy framework with world-leading environmental standards so that employees and car makers in Europe can develop within them right here. We managed it before with coal and steel. Why should we not also now succeed in doing it for the industry of mobility and the future? Grab the ball! The Commission has a lot of room to act here, and it can launch a lot of initiatives. Commissioner Kroes, according to my information, of the 4.5 billion that form part of the deal that has to be reached, you have already approved 1.5 billion so that the wheels keep turning. Naturally, you must check the law and the legislation – what is the alternative? Of course, all necessary steps must be taken to bring about a fair distribution of burdens in the future negotiations. I implore you, however, to conduct your checks quickly, to consistently come to a conclusion but, given what is at stake, it is absolutely vital that this opportunity not be destroyed. It must not fail on trivialities. Instead, we must also note the significance of the situation and we must achieve a European solution, in the public interest, that benefits everyone.

Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, with our report on small-scale fishing, we are underlining the fact that we are sensitive to the needs of traditional and artisanal fishermen and listen to their concerns. Traditional fishing produces more jobs and less CO2
 per kilo of catch than industrial fishing. The small-scale fishing lobby, however, is weaker. That is why we must be vigilant and ensure that it is not put at a disadvantage in the allocation of quotas, for example. We will also be voting tomorrow on Parliament’s position on the external dimension of the Common Fisheries Policy. This report is intended to form the basis for our future decisions, for example on fisheries agreements. I am pleased that with one exception, all groups were able to agree on a text.  A minority has now drafted a resolution which I hope will be rejected by a majority of the House. The comments that have been made about shark-finning give me cause for optimism. Here, the PPE appears to be endorsing the majority opinion, albeit at the last minute. Shark-finning must be banned in the EU at long last, without any legal loopholes. Ulrike Rodust  (S&amp;D

 Mr President, Mr Cioloş, ladies and gentlemen, we are in the middle of reforming the common agricultural policy and Parliament, in its new role of colegislator, will tomorrow adopt the first regulation from the reform package on the application of direct payments for the transitional year 2013. This is a positive development and an important moment. I would particularly like to thank the rapporteur, Mr Capoulas Santos, for his very good work which, most importantly, was completed quickly. This regulation must come into force on 1 January 2014 to ensure that there are no financing problems during the transition from the current regulation to the next reformed regulation on direct payments. Therefore, it was particularly important for Parliament and the Council to reach an agreement quickly. Continuity in financing is a decisive factor for the Member States. This is why it is so important that the transitional regulation for 2013 comes into force at the right time. The current regulation on direct payments remains valid in 2013, but some of the financial provisions in the regulation only apply until 2012. I welcome the solution identified by Parliament and the Council, and particularly the transfer from Pillar 1 to Pillar 2. Ulrike Rodust  (S&amp;D

 Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I welcome the fact that we are drawing attention to the animal disease caused by the Schmallenberg virus today through this oral question, as it shows that we take this issue seriously. Many farmers have been waiting desperately for this moment. As you have already heard, 944 holdings have already been hit by the Schmallenberg virus in Germany alone. This has caused huge problems for these farms. Because of its proximity to the coast and the protection of its dykes, my own region of Schleswig-Holstein has a large number of sheep farmers. Many sheep have been infected with this virus. The virus threatens the survival of many farming businesses, particularly at present in the lambing season. The number of cases continues to rise. Both sheep and beef farmers are suffering from the effects of this virus in Schleswig-Holstein. In the last week alone, the number of cases in my region has risen from 106 farms with infected animals last week to 116 farms this week. Even though the virus does not pose a threat to humans, farming businesses are suffering serious financial losses due to deformities and still-births. I would also like to draw your attention to the suffering of the animals. I believe that this is also something unacceptable. We urgently need a vaccine. I would be interested to know what progress has been made by researchers in this regard and whether the Commission is supporting Member States in the search for a vaccine. Perhaps we should also consider whether it is possible to help the farms that have been financially hit by the virus in some other way. What options are open to the Commission here and what steps have already been taken? Please act quickly and keep us informed of developments. Our farmers are counting on you, and on us.

 Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, what are we dealing with here today? We are trying to adopt multi-annual plans for our fishing stocks in order to bring an end to overfishing in our seas. Multi-annual plans are the key tool in our fisheries policy. The fish in question today, the Atlantic horse mackerel, is just one example of many. We aim to produce management plans for all commercially fished species. Almost exactly 16 months ago, we were here in the House and Parliament adopted its position on this multi-annual plan. We have had the attempt to negotiate with the Council. Unfortunately nothing came of the talks, as the fisheries ministers within the Union apparently would like to work without involving Parliament when it comes to important issues. Over the past 16 months, the Council has not budged an inch. It has demonstrated complete obstinacy, a quality that is not a bad one to have in politics, but in this case it is scandalous. The Council has ensured that there are absolutely no new long-term management plans in place. It is as if the tug of war between the institutions were more important than a sensible policy for our fishermen, for our environment and for our citizens. If we want people to be satisfied with the European Union, we must deliver results. In the area of fisheries policy, we have not done that for two years now. In the past, European fisheries policy was in the sole hands of the Council of Ministers. Unfortunately, the result was a disaster. That the ministers should now have the idea of continuing to make policy without Parliament’s involvement seems, against that backdrop, to be something of a bad joke! If we were to actually negotiate with one another about the reform of the common fisheries policy the citizens of the European Union would also observe who was going into bat for a progressive policy and who was putting the brakes on. Ministers, please take a look at yourselves and then manoeuvre yourselves out of this dead end as soon as possible. Ulrike Rodust  (S&amp;D

 Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, I welcome the approach taken in the regulation on contractual relations in the milk sector of strengthening the negotiating position of milk producers and ensuring fairer prices. It is important that we do not leave the milk producers high and dry once the milk quotas are abolished. Small and medium-sized family businesses, in particular, rely on the fact that they are supported by the European Union and not left unprotected at the mercy of the milk purchasers and retailers. I would have liked for us to have introduced mandatory contracts at Member State level. However, the Council and the Commission fought tooth and nail against the idea. It is a shame that the Council is not here now. I believe that the compromise that has now been reached is acceptable, but it does not go far enough. Therefore, we must ensure that the interests of small and medium-sized milk producers, in particular, are taken into consideration in the upcoming reform of the common agricultural policy. My main concern will continue to be fighting for a sustainable and multi-functional agriculture that covers the whole of Europe. Ulrike Rodust  (S&amp;D

 Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I am very pleased to see this topic addressed in plenary and I would like to offer my thanks to Mr Bové. It really is a very important issue that we are debating today, be it for producers, processors, for trade or for consumers. Production costs for farmers have risen sharply over recent years. Farmers can primarily feel the increasing overheads when it comes to energy bills and agricultural inputs. The heavy concentration of food retailing, above all, makes it more difficult for producers to obtain good prices for their products. Although the mark-up between the primary and the end product is sometimes considerable, not much of that reaches producers, as some of the margin is lost to each of the various processing steps. Politicians can intervene in competition policy, but we must be careful when doing so, and, in certain areas, we have to trust to market forces. I consider it important to let consumers know that buying regional products from their producers or makers supports both the farmers and the local economy. That is where I see our role. We should intervene in this connection, be it with money or with political instruments. I believe strengthening regionalism provides a tool to do this. In the reform of the common agricultural policy, we need to make other tools available. For me as a Social Democrat, it is important that access to wholesome food at reasonable prices should be guaranteed for all, while, at the same time, farmers must be able to receive a fair and reasonable income for their work. This demand requires us not to shirk our responsibility, and indeed to live up to it. Every time we act, we need to ask ourselves if we are living up to these demands. If not, the result will be social unrest in the long run. Farmers and consumers are in the same boat. Let us ensure that that boat never sinks. Ulrike Rodust,

 Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, this House has now been dealing with the fisheries agreement between the European Union and Morocco for over a year, and I am sure that tomorrow’s vote will not be the end of it. This agreement has become a highly emotive issue. The whole of Parliament is talking about the agreement; the debate has been a matter of controversy within all the groups in recent days and weeks. This is a fisheries agreement that needs careful analysis. What is the result of such analysis? Those of us who are members of the Committee on Fisheries are agreed that this agreement is not ecologically sustainable, because it contributes to overfishing. I regret to say that this has rather been forgotten in the debate so far, but nonetheless it is a key point. In view of the catastrophic state of the world’s seas, the European Union should not be allowed to overfish its own waters, much less waters belonging to third countries. This protocol also has no economic merit. There is no win-win situation for us. In addition, there remains the Western Sahara question. I am sure we are agreed that the agreement must be in accordance with international law. The current protocol on which we are going to vote has all these shortcomings. For this reason, it is not possible to vote in favour of it. We are now being consoled with the idea that it will all change in the future. I hope that is so, and that our resolution will help the Council and the Commission to get things right in the negotiations with Morocco. The only convincing reason for voting in favour is that the protocol is about to expire and the Commission has asked us not to bring about a break in it, because that would make the new negotiations more difficult. It assures us that all our demands will be incorporated into the new protocol. Not only is that something I am expecting, but indeed I am relying on it being the case. Ulrike Rodust  (S&amp;D

 Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, illegal fishing poses a serious threat to our fish stocks and to all honest fishermen, who are being swindled out of part of their income. At this point, I would like to take the unusual step of praising the Council of Ministers, which succeeded in agreeing an IUU regulation before the Treaty of Lisbon came into force, in other words, without our cooperation. That was an important step forward. However, Ms Lövin’s excellent report makes it clear that there is still a lot of work to do. Illegal fishing is a typical example of problems that are so big that the European Union cannot deal with them on its own. We need global solutions. The fact is that global solutions require effective global institutions. As the rapporteur on reform of the common fisheries policy, I would like to close with the following remark: the best protection against illegal fishing is afforded by fishermen who know the rules and who are convinced that these make sense. This must be our guiding principle in pursuing new reforms. Ulrike Rodust  (S&amp;D

 Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I would like to make one thing clear in advance. As a Social Democrat, it is important to me to help needy people. However, for me the focus is primarily on creating jobs, in order to enable people to take care of themselves. In my opinion, the food aid programme for needy people in its current form is not the right way of helping people to help themselves. I see this as charity, which is damaging to people’s dignity. It seems relatively clear to me that buying food and distributing it free of charge to needy people is not agricultural policy. It falls within the realms of social policy. Under the terms of the current legal basis, social policy is a matter for the Member States. In Germany there is a system of food banks. Volunteer helpers collect food which can no longer be used by supermarkets, for example. Given the fact that 89 million tonnes of food goes to landfill every year in Europe, initiatives of this kind make sense, but they are also charitable in nature. Let us create sensible infrastructures to ensure that people do not have to rely on charity. This means, for example, allowing them to be independent by providing good jobs and good pensions.

 Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, I would like to thank the rapporteur and I am pleased that the report bears unmistakably socialist, social democratic hallmarks. We want a sustainable, ecological and social agricultural policy. We want greening and we want it in the first pillar. Cross-compliance and the agro-environmental measures of the system to date are not enough to achieve support for the whole of society, but that is precisely what we need. Our primary objective must be to ensure high-quality and sustainable food production in Europe and for our rural areas to be active and vital. We absolutely have to stop the increasing land abandonment, because we need people. People to look after the agricultural sector, as well as the areas upstream and downstream. The rumours emanating from the Commission concerning plans for massive cuts in rural development in the next multiannual financial framework are not acceptable. We must continue to work for a strong second pillar in the common agricultural policy (CAP), for rural areas and for Europe. I would like to issue a general warning to anyone intending to cut agricultural funding. If this is done, there will be no reform. Everything will then stay the same as it is. That will be quite inexplicable to the citizens of Europe. Ulrike Rodust  (S&amp;D

 Mr President, Commissioner, I come from the region of Europe where the outbreak of the EHEC pathogen is at its raging worst. This aggressive bacteria seems unstoppable. Between mid-May and noon yesterday, 1 733 people were infected, while 23 patients died a torturous death. The situation in the clinics is extremely fraught. Intensive care beds are running out, and blood plasma is needed urgently. No end is in sight. The people of my home area fear new cases every day. For me, it is a question of courage and a sense of responsibility to warn about every even potential carrier of this bacterium. Various foodstuffs have been analysed, but it has not been found. My understanding of high grade foodstuffs is that they are healthy and that they are placed on the market subject to monitoring. I am presuming that glaring errors have been made in this regard, and once again, we are finding out that there are loopholes. However, to claim, in this situation, that the cause is known, without having well-founded laboratory research to back it up, is negligent in the extreme. In all the understandable panic, there must not, under any circumstances, be a witch-hunt, as that would drive many hard-working farmers throughout Europe to the wall. It therefore needs to be clear to everyone that we in the European Union need to show solidarity with one another and stand ready to provide mutual assistance in the event of emergencies. In other words, all the medical experts must sit down together, and economic assistance needs to be provided to those who innocently find themselves facing financial disaster. Ulrike Rodust  (S&amp;D

 Madam President, Mr Andor, ladies and gentlemen, we must do everything we can to counteract the spread of antibiotic resistance. We are in complete agreement on this. This involves the responsible use of antibiotics in human medicine and in animal husbandry. The European Union must take determined action. We must not allow 25 000 people to go on dying from infections caused by resistant bacteria every year in the European Union alone. Antibiotics must not be used routinely or preventively. We must ensure that antibiotics are used responsibly in all the Member States. It is of the utmost importance that every possible effort is made to keep livestock healthy from the rearing stage onwards, until they are fully grown. Ensuring that animals are healthy is the best means of avoiding infection and the use of antibiotics. The way the animals are fed is decisive in this respect, but the husbandry is also important. We should also be open to the use of alternative methods, such as homeopathy and phytotherapy, in livestock husbandry. We need more research and more information in Europe about these alternative approaches. Ulrike Rodust  (S&amp;D

Madam President, open borders are an important symbol for Europe. I would like to draw your attention to another problem. I come from Northern Germany, which is why the German-Danish border is of particular importance for me. The right-wing populist Danish People’s Party is trying to force the Danish Government to reintroduce border controls. What is the reason for this? It is a fear of people from Romania and Bulgaria. This is scandalous. The right-wing populists are rapidly growing in numbers and represent a real danger for Europe. Of course we must have protections against untrammelled criminality and our security authorities have already found effective alternatives to passport controls. It makes me very sad that one of our major European achievements is to be put at risk. The EU success in promoting peace and freedom is without historical parallel but is now under high-level attack. I would call on the Danish Government not to allow itself to be dictated to by the right-wing populists. Ulrike Rodust,

 Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, European fisheries are in a state of deep crisis, as my fellow Members have said. Fishermen in all European seas complain about the painful drop in income, which may be severe enough to threaten their existence. Yet, why is the income of our fishermen decreasing? As far as I can see, there are three reasons for this. Firstly, there is the decline in fish stocks; secondly, the general fall in prices in precisely the area where fish stocks are healthy and supply is too high; and thirdly – and this is what we are concerned about today – operating costs are higher as a result of rising crude oil prices. We politicians need to step in here. We must do what we can to help. I would stress that we can only do what we can. The motion for a resolution tabled by the Group of the European People’s Party (Christian Democrats) promises more than we can deliver. It demands an increase of 100% in the de minimis
 aid ceiling from EUR 30 000 to EUR 60 000, which is to be used to fund fuel subsidies. However, fuel subsidies are something that many Member States really cannot afford. Therefore, most fishermen would not be helped by this at all. Moreover, the other two problems would still remain: firstly, overfishing would actually increase and, secondly, it would not solve the problem of market prices. Where financial support for fisheries is concerned, I can see a much greater problem. The Member States do not use the resources of the European Fisheries Fund, although the European Union pays 50%. Something urgently needs to change in this regard in the interests of our fishermen. Ladies and gentlemen, let us work together to produce a differentiated text by Thursday and jointly come up with a sensible, sustainable and less showy fisheries policy. Ulrike Rodust,

 Mr President, Commissioner Damanaki, ladies and gentlemen, once again we find a whole package of fisheries policies on the agenda. In my capacity as coordinator, I am pleased to see that we have reached a compromise with the Council and Commission on two regulations. I refer to the Grelier report on technical measures and the Ferreira report on the second financial instrument. We shall also be able to vote in favour of the fisheries agreement with the Union of the Comoros, although I do not wish to hide the fact that I would like to see a fundamental realignment of the partnership agreements within the framework of the reform of the common fisheries policy. However, there are real problems between the institutions in relation to Greenland, where Parliament’s powers are not respected. I am gradually losing patience with the fact that the level of cooperation between the institutions is still so poor. This is something that I have raised time and time again already. I am raising the issue again today. The problem with the management plans must be resolved as a matter of urgency. I would appeal to the Hungarian Presidency of the Council to actively press for a solution. The fact that there is no representative from the Council here today is a clear sign of the Council’s lack of respect for Parliament. I find this incredible. One final remark about the Grelier report. I am aware that some of my fellow Members are frustrated because it was not possible to incorporate the amendments they wanted. However, I find it very regrettable that our fishermen are forced to work with out-of-date technical measures. The fault in this case lies with the Council, which has been unable to agree to a new regulation. As a Parliament we have a great deal of responsibility, which is why we need to act responsibly and extend the existing regulation without amendments. Ulrike Rodust  (S&amp;D

Madam President, food prices have reached new record highs. The volatility of food prices has increased in recent years for various reasons. There is, therefore, great cause for concern. Climate change is causing extreme weather conditions and in some countries whole crops have been destroyed. In addition, there is increasing speculation on food, the danger of which cannot be overestimated – you only have to look at the financial crisis. Moreover, there is increasingly often competition between providing food for the poor and running the cars of the rich. We need to find solutions so that farmers have sufficient incentive to produce food and that only areas that are not used for food production are used for the production of the likes of biofuels. For me as a Social Democrat it is important that everyone has access to wholesome food at reasonable prices and at the same time that farmers are able to receive a reasonable income for their work. Ulrike Rodust,  
on behalf of the S&amp;D Group.

Madam President, Commissioner, I am rather surprised by your remarks. My perception of the press – at least in Germany – is somewhat different. It makes me extremely angry, too, that again and again, we are faced with scandals in the area of food safety. We cannot allow this to happen. I am aware that regulations and laws alone cannot prevent criminal activities in this area. However, we must do everything we can to make it as difficult as possible for those responsible. The Commission must call on the Member States to urgently review the level of their penalties in this area. The wilful and negligent handling of food and feed must not be punished with trivial penalties. Often, the fine is so low compared with the profit that it is paid out of the petty cash. It is also extremely important to increase the number of state inspectors. The current example in Germany demonstrates very well that the principle of self-checking has major shortcomings. I would like to point out that the polluter pays principle needs to be applied consistently throughout the whole chain – from trough to table. After all, the safety of our food begins with what we feed to our animals. Innocent people should not have to suffer the consequences of the criminal behaviour of others. As yet, it is not clear who will pay for the losses suffered by farmers as a result of the dioxin scandal. One thing is certain: it will not be the polluters that have gone bankrupt, as there is absolutely no money left there. This is unacceptable. In this regard, a European fund should be considered that all feedstuff manufacturers would have to pay into. The problems that keep occurring in connection with food safety continue to make one thing clear: for the whole process chain, for both food as well as feed, we need to ensure complete traceability. The EU regulation and national legislation need to be improved in this regard. Ulrike Rodust  (S&amp;D

 Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, as coordinator for the Committee on Fisheries, I find the fisheries aspect of this interim agreement particularly interesting. In this regard, there were a few controversial issues at the start with regard to the relaxation of the rules of origin for Papua New Guinea. I support the Commission’s idea of using this relaxation to stimulate the economy of one of the poorest countries in the world. I am convinced that this is also something that should be of concern to those of us involved in fisheries policy. At the same time, I can understand the concerns of the European industry, but I cannot honestly imagine that the relaxations granted will lead to Papua New Guinea becoming a serious competitor of our canning industry. However, we need to be vigilant, because it will clearly not help anyone if we relocate half our canning industry to the Pacific region. In this regard, I have to say, however, that during the debate on this agreement, we have been presented with very contradictory information regarding the question of the extent to which investments are being made in Papua New Guinea and which states are profiting indirectly from the relaxation of the rules of origin. I would therefore urgently call on the Commission to closely monitor the application of this derogation and to submit a report to Parliament in a timely manner on the impact on Papua New Guinea’s development and on the European canning industry. If this arrangement does not have the desired effect in Papua New Guinea and entails unacceptable losses for European companies, we will have to make a different decision when we come to negotiate the final agreement. Please keep us informed of developments. Ulrike Rodust  (S&amp;D

 Mr President, Commissioner, at this point, I would like once again to point out that a decision has already been made to ban the practice of battery farming in cages. The Member States and the egg producers have had plenty of time to implement the directive for the abandonment of conventional battery practices. The time has not run out quite yet – there are still twelve months to go before the practice is to be completely banned. I believe that we must ensure that battery farming is completely banned by 1 January 2012. It must be possible to threaten the Member States who have not succeeded in implementing the directive by then with legal action, such as financial penalties. We also need to ensure that eggs which originate from farming practices that do not comply with European law are not sold in the internal European market. Ulrike Rodust  (S&amp;D

 I would like to draw the attention of the Council to a problem which is threatening to paralyse the cooperation between the two institutions on the subject of fisheries policy. This is about the regulations for long-term management plans. These regulations lie at the heart of the common fisheries policy. The Council and a majority of the Member States do not accept that the Treaty of Lisbon has given the European Parliament the right of codecision on these regulations. The ministers are acting in opposition to the Council and the Council’s legal service, in opposition to the opinion of the Commission and in opposition, of course, to the will of the European Parliament. The Council currently has two management plans which cannot be adopted. The Commission cannot submit further plans, which are urgently needed in the interests of our fishermen and our seas and which have long since been completed and are lying in a drawer. This situation is unacceptable. I am calling on the Belgian Presidency and the future Hungarian Presidency to start negotiations with Parliament immediately, so that we can find a solution. We are ready to begin discussions. Thank you very much. Ulrike Rodust  (S&amp;D

 Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, I support the compromise reached for the resolution. As coordinator for the Group of the Progressive Alliance of Socialists and Democrats in the European Parliament in the Committee on Fisheries, I am also interested in the fisheries agreement with Morocco. It is good that we are calling for the resolution for international law to be respected in connection with the exploitation of resources in Western Sahara. Unfortunately, most Members of this House are not aware that there is an opinion issued by Parliament’s legal service which states that the current fisheries agreement with Morocco contravenes international law if it is not demonstrated that the people of Western Sahara benefit from the agreement. There is currently no demonstration of this and the European Commission has therefore put negotiations concerning renewal of the agreement on hold. I very much hope that a diplomatic solution can be found here. However, it has to be clear to us that we cannot ignore international law on account of economic interests. Ulrike Rodust  (S&amp;D

 Madam President, Mr Cioloş, ladies and gentlemen, bees play a decisive role in our ecosystem. On the one hand, they are important for the preservation of biodiversity and, on the other, biodiversity is important for the preservation of the bees, not only because this is the International Year of Biodiversity, but also because they contribute to our own survival. As part of the reform of the common agricultural policy, we should focus, among other things, on preventing monocultures and increasing the use of wide crop rotation. I do not want to talk about plant protection products and pesticides today. I think that it is important to promote and develop research in this area and to improve the coordination between different research projects in the individual Member States in order to ensure that we have healthy bees. Whatever happens, we should continue to support the beekeeping sector beyond 2013 and also make sure that in future, we have both enough bees and enough beekeepers to care for them.

 Mr President, Mrs Damanaki, I am very pleased that this week, we are able to adopt four important regulations on fisheries policy, and that we have been able to reach agreement among ourselves as well as with the Council and Commission on the reports concerning aquaculture and technical measures in the Baltic Sea. Unfortunately, the same cannot be said for the two regulations on long-term management plans. The right formula for management of sardine stocks has always been subject to considerable argument among the committee. I believe that the submission to plenary looks very good and I am pleased that it seems that the Group of the European People’s Party (Christian Democrats) has also now realised this, as it has tabled no more amendments. I assume that you will be voting in favour tomorrow. We have a much more serious problem where the Council is concerned, however. Contrary to the advice of their own legal experts, the majority of the Member States are refusing to accept the European Parliament’s right of codecision – a full year after the entry into force of the Treaty of Lisbon! I consider that outrageous. I have therefore suggested to the chair of our committee that a joint letter be written to the European fisheries ministers. I would be pleased if we could reach agreement in the coming days so that together, we can demonstrate how determined Parliament is. We will not allow ourselves to be fobbed off by the Council so easily. Ulrike Rodust,

 Mr President, Commissioner Damanaki, ladies and gentlemen, I am pleased that we are able to adopt a regulation that represents one more small step towards our shared goal of sustainable fisheries. The regional fisheries organisations are extraordinarily important institutions for good management worldwide. Unfortunately, the negotiations are often difficult and progress much too slow for impatient people such as me. We must therefore do all we can to strengthen the regional fisheries organisations. I will now comment on the specific outcome of the NEAFC report. I believe that the new port state control ruling in the NEAFC and the new measures to prevent illegal fisheries are very much to be welcomed. Nonetheless, we had to conduct intensive negotiations with the Council and Commission on matters that seem extremely technical at first glance, but which are important for our future work. I think we have found a compromise that is acceptable to all parties in the matter of delegated acts. We also succeeded in reaching agreement on how future NEAFC decisions are to be transposed into EU law. It is no secret, however, that the Commission is not very happy with the result achieved here. I can understand that. We cannot allow it to take years for the European Union to implement NEAFC decisions. In this respect, Council and Parliament must together prove that we are able to conclude a codecision procedure quickly where necessary. Finally, I would like to say something about a matter that is very current: the dispute with Iceland over mackerel fishing. We already have the NEAFC, which governs the international waters of the North-East Atlantic. In the case of migratory species such as mackerel, however, we also need an agreement that applies in territorial waters. As you know, that is still a sticking point. I feel it is extremely regrettable that, despite the cooperation working in the main, there is so much dispute over this. How about giving the regional fisheries organisations authority for coastal waters – at least for migratory species? It would be a radical step, of course, but undoubtedly one worth considering.

 Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, we should vote in favour of this report on the animal experiments directive. In its negotiations with the Commission and the Council, Parliament has achieved a great deal: namely replacement, reduction and refinement. It is true that from an animal welfare perspective, we are still doing too little. However, the Council was not prepared to do more and has made it clear that there would be no new directive if we did not accept these results. This does not mean that we cannot continue to make progress in this area in future. Animal welfare and research must be given high priority in our policies. I would be very happy if we were able to stop animal experiments completely today. Unfortunately, we are a long way from achieving this goal and, therefore, we must ensure that we provide animals with as much protection as possible. The compromise that has been negotiated offers a far better foundation for doing this. The only important thing is to make sure that all the Member States implement the new directive consistently. I would like to thank the rapporteur and all the shadow rapporteurs warmly for their hard work. Ulrike Rodust  (S&amp;D

I thank the rapporteur. Many ideas from my group have been worked into the report before us, and now we have a very good result. Our primary goal must be to ensure high-quality food production in Europe. In the discussion on the organisation of agrarian reform, there was frequent talk of compensation of public goods. In my opinion, this debate goes in the right direction. Only if the citizens of the EU are convinced that efforts are really being made and money is not simply being paid out across the board will the common agricultural policy get the recognition that it deserves. The development of rural areas plays an ever greater role. In order to prevent the obliteration and desertification of our agriculture, we must develop further instruments that will stop the rural exodus. Active rural areas are an attractive living environment not just for farmers, but also for people who do not want to live in cities. We should approve the report as it stands with a large majority in plenary in order to send a clear outward signal. Ulrike Rodust  (S&amp;D

 Mr President, Mrs Damanaki, European fisheries policy is facing enormous challenges. Our fishermen have to cope with diminishing stocks and at the same time have to deal with competition on the global market that is not always fair. We urgently need to introduce radical reforms in order to put an end to overfishing in European waters and to ensure the survival of European fisheries. I agree with Commissioner Damanaki that we should not ask too much of our fishermen by on the one hand demanding that they make radical reforms while on the other liberalising trade. Doing both of these things at the same time will place too high a burden on our fishermen. The best way to increase competitiveness is to allow fish stocks to recover. Another way to enable European fisheries to survive would be through better marketing. Under certain circumstances, European consumers are prepared to pay more for European fish if they are better informed about its origin. Ulrike Rodust  (S&amp;D

 Mr President, I have not asked for the floor to raise a point of order, but I would like to ask you, Mr President, and my fellow Members to be aware of the following: there is a problem with the translation here. I have tabled an amendment to the Lyon report, recital Ae: ‘whereas the CAP must be geared to the maintenance and development of multifunctional, sustainable agriculture throughout Europe.’ Unfortunately, the word ‘extensive’ has been used in the translations. However, the word ‘flächendeckend’ in the German translation has a completely different meaning. It means ‘in all of the regions of Europe’. There should be agriculture (‘flächendeckend’ agriculture) even throughout mountainous regions. ‘Extensive’ means something entirely different. Ulrike Rodust  (S&amp;D

Madam President, I would like to thank Mrs Damanaki and Mr Oettinger. Their words give us hope. Although the Gulf of Mexico is a long way away, the disaster may affect our animal life too, fish in particular. If the oil from the Gulf is driven into the open Atlantic, it could affect the spawning grounds of the European eel, for example, which was already threatened with extinction prior to the oil catastrophe. This is not a natural event, but rather an unbelievable disaster triggered by human error. For this reason, we must do all we can to ensure something like this never happens again. We are responsible for the safety of European oil platforms. We need to put our laws to the test because European environmental liability provisions are not enforceable in the event of oil catastrophes on the high seas. There are over 400 oil platforms in the North Sea alone. In view of the fact that the European Union has 320 000 km of maritime coast, it is essential that we should move away from oil and towards a future based on renewable energies. I call on the Commission to propose concrete solutions and to act quickly. Ulrike Rodust  (S&amp;D

 Madam President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, the so-called compromise proposal that will be tabled next week in Agadir is, in my view, completely unacceptable. A resumption of commercial whaling is something that the majority of the European public will not understand. I call on the Commission and the Member States to speak out at the meeting in Morocco against the reintroduction of commercial whaling. Of course, on paper the compromise does not, at first sight, look so bad. Its supporters say that it will permit even fewer whales to be hunted than is currently the case. The compromise proposal provides for the introduction of quotas. Let me tell you something from my own experience of quotas in fisheries policy. Quotas, particularly when they apply worldwide, are systematically circumvented. Just look at bluefin tuna. Here quotas are laid down year after year that are systematically exceeded many times over. There is another reason why the European Union should oppose this compromise. It provides for quotas only for those countries that currently – and I would say ‘semi-legally’ – carry out whaling. That would reward the systematic violation of the rules. We should not accept this under any circumstances. Supporters of whaling are hard-nosed in their methods. Japan has allegedly even collected votes from poorer Member States. That is yet another reason why the European Union needs to be united in its rejection of the reintroduction of commercial whaling.

 Madam President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, firstly, I would like to offer my sincere thanks to my fellow Member Mr Milana, who has managed to produce a first-class report. In view of the dramatic overfishing of our seas and the continually growing demand for fish products, alternatives to wild catches are needed now more than ever. However, aquaculture is only an alternative if ecological interests do not get ignored. For me, ecologically-sound aquaculture means, for example, that efforts need to be made to reduce the proportion of fish meal in the feed. Ultimately, we will help our seas very little if we catch 4 kilograms of wild fish in order to produce 1 kilogram of farmed fish. It is also important to avoid a negative impact on surrounding waters. In this regard, much needs to be done in the area of research. At the same time, we must ensure that fish farming does not degenerate into a form of animal cruelty as a result of high stocking densities. In this regard, I would particularly like to stress the fact that we urgently need to establish a maritime development plan. The coexistence of different interests such as aquaculture, fisheries, tourism and, not least, nature conservation must be organised well. All of this has been admirably expressed in our report. Incidentally, a stronger European aquaculture is also valuable from the point of view of employment policy, as it can create jobs in our often disadvantaged coastal regions. Ulrike Rodust  (S&amp;D

 Mr President, the catch documentation programme adopted by the International Commission for the Conservation of Atlantic Tunas (ICCAT) and confirmed by us today is a step in the right direction, but it comes too late. It must not be the case that we only take drastic measures once stocks of a threatened species are decimated to 6%. Illegal fishing is a particular problem here. I still very much regret the fact that the European Union did not succeed in obtaining a better outcome in the CITES negotiation. The ICCAT and other regional fisheries organisations must act with more foresight in future. It is therefore important that we as the European Parliament get more involved in these bodies to counterbalance the short-sighted national interests. The public interest in the sustainable management of fish stocks is becoming ever greater. It is important to convert this into a responsible policy. Mrs Damanaki, I can assure you that the Group of the Progressive Alliance of Socialists and Democrats in the European Parliament will support you in any activity that helps to maintain bluefin tuna stocks and to safeguard the livelihoods of the fishermen.

 Mr President, Mr Cioloş, I have in front of me an analysis of the economic situation in the German agricultural sector. The analysis involved the evaluation of 19 100 sets of accounts from full-time and part-time farms. The results have been projected on the basis of the distribution of farms from the Farm Structure Survey of 2007. In the financial year 2008-2009, the overall situation deteriorated significantly. The figures for the 18 200 full-time dairy and arable farms fell from EUR 45 400 to EUR 34 400. That represents a reduction of 24%. Particularly large losses occurred in 2008-2009. Operating results fell to EUR 29 300 (minus 45%) and to EUR 43 000 (minus 18%). In contrast, mixed livestock farms … (The President cut off the speaker) Ulrike Rodust  (S&amp;D

 Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, a warm welcome to all the fishermen and -women in the Chamber! Today’s vote represents a milestone for the European Parliament. For the first time since the ratification of the Treaty of Lisbon, we have the opportunity to express our opinions on the reform of the common fisheries policy (CFP). In the next few years, our power and our responsibilities will increase significantly. This report is acceptable and I would like to thank Mrs Patrão Neves and Mrs Andrés Barea for their hard work. We have succeeded in incorporating important social democratic concerns into the report. These include specific support for small-scale fisheries. Those affected will now be included in the decision-making process. Support must be given in particular to small family businesses. Their presence in the coastal regions not only provides jobs, but also increases the attractiveness of many of these regions for tourists. Some parts of this report still need improvement and we have tabled amendments for that purpose. We social democrats want to make it clear that one of the central problems is the outstanding overcapacity. It is a fact that environmental sustainability is a fundamental prerequisite for the economic survival of fishermen. Therefore, the environment must take priority. A third important point concerns the external aspects of the CFP and the partnership agreements with third countries. We move that paragraph 121, which puts undue emphasis on the interests of European fisheries, should be deleted. We should behave outside European waters in just the same way as we do at home. This means promoting sustainability, human rights and democracy throughout the world and ensuring that the income from partnership agreements does not disappear into the coffers of corrupt dictatorships. Finally, I would like to make one more fundamental point. European fisheries policy is a hot potato, because it involves so many powerful national interests. It will come as no surprise that these have led to heated debates within the groups in recent weeks. Fortunately, we have all succeeded in finding effective compromises. However, when it comes to the legislative process, we must focus more closely on this issue than we have today and come up with some common European solutions. We must leave the trivial problems of national greed to the Council. Ulrike Rodust  (S&amp;D

 Madam President, Commissioner, Council, I would like to begin by thanking my fellow Member Mr Capoulas Santos, who has made this resolution possible. Today we are talking about our dairy farmers and whether we are going to leave them in the lurch or deal with them in an honest manner. I do not believe that we should leave them in the lurch, but should be honest in our dealings with them. Yes, short-term measures to overcome the crisis are urgently needed. Yes, intervention is perfectly acceptable for a short period if the price of milk has reached rock bottom, and additional subsidies, loans and funds to combat the crisis are justified. However, what is totally unacceptable is, firstly, to start up discussions about milk quotas again and, secondly, to reintroduce tax-funded export refunds for products supplied to developing countries. We abandoned this one way street in 2003 and I appeal to you to keep it that way for the sake of our dairy farmers.
