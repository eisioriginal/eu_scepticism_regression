 Mr President, I should just like to say that my group agrees to your proposal to vote on the original report paragraph by paragraph. The report is good enough, almost perfect to begin with; these amendments have been tabled for the plenary. I should just like to explain to the House, to anyone who may not have been paying attention, that it is true that 200 amendments come from the Group of the European People’s Party (Christian Democrats) and European Democrats and another 200 from other groups, but altogether 350 amendments come from Forza Italia
 and Alleanza Nazionale
. It is obvious, therefore, that they all come from Mr Berlusconi’s friends. We therefore agree to your proposal, Mr President, and will vote accordingly.

 Mr President, we have finally reached the discussion of Mrs Boogerd-Quaak’s report in this House. It is an excellent report, which stems from her concern – shared by the overwhelming majority in Parliament – for the freedom of information and expression in the European Union. We would, of course, have preferred it if the Commission had put forward a specific proposal for a directive during these five years. The situation is indeed causing ever greater concern in all the countries in the Union as a result of massive concentrations of the media and increasingly blatant attempts by governments to steer, control and use the media in order to maintain and increase their own power. The dreadful example of Italy, however, concerns us most, both because of the damage it has done to freedom of information and because of the example it sets to other European countries. Europe cannot continue to remain silent about the scandal of a Prime Minister who owns the three private television networks, owns the largest company collecting television advertising revenue and controls the three public networks, at the head of which he places all his political sympathisers, and he even publicly announces the dismissal of journalists like Enzo Biagi and Michele Santoro, whom he considers undesirable. In a Europe that is becoming more and more neoliberalistic and antidemocratic, where the power of the media actively contributes to a single way of thinking, to wars and to the dismantling of the welfare state, we have to give a sign that we are changing direction or, at least, rethinking things. The Boogerd-Quaak report on the media is a step in this direction and will therefore gain the votes of our group, the Confederal Group of the European United Left/Nordic Green Left.

Mr President, I do not want to repeat all the things that my fellow Members who spoke before me have already expressed very well. On many occasions, the Commission has said that this is the best agreement that it could extract from the United States Government, but it must be said that, the more debates we have, the worse the situation gets for European citizens. Indeed, today we know that this agreement not only implies a violation of the Treaties, but even the possibility that these data will be transferred to a third country and will be processed by them, which thus made it more difficult to get the debate on the first part of the agreement under way. As has already been said, this Parliament has often said that it is against this agreement. Of course, it has not specifically voted on resorting to the Court of Justice but this, in my opinion, is a necessary consequence. We are therefore calling for Parliament to be able to take the opinion of a third, much respected and authoritative authority, such as the Court of Justice, and thus be able to freely decide whether to say yes or no to this agreement.

 The vote in this Parliament on the Trans-European Networks (TENs) for transport has fortunately brought back the strict obligation to respect the Community directives on the following: strategic environmental impact assessments, consultation of residents, preservation of conservation sites and of protected human settlements. This is an obligation that the initial proposals from the committee and the Commission ignored. The bridge over the Strait of Messina, an addition to the North-South rail route – only proposed at the request of the Italian Government, though never subject to environmental impact assessments, as the former Commissioner Mr Van Miert admitted to the Members of this Parliament – has been crossed off the list of projects of European interest. Indeed, this was an unsustainable project, which had already squandered EUR 80 million on producing incomplete studies on the impact of more than 60 km of road and rail links on a highly urbanised area. The landscapes of the Costa Viola and the Messina region would end up devastated, and the tourist resources and the urban settlements would be destroyed. Fortunately, after the proposal by the Confederal Group of the European United Left/Nordic Green Left, the Group of the Greens/European Free Alliance and the Group of the Party of European Socialists, this project, which came about only as the result of the Italian Prime Minster’s megalomania and lack of respect for the environment, will not uselessly drain Community funds. A battle remains to be fought to ensure that the project is also crossed off the list of Italian works provided for by the Law on Objectives, and that instead employment and development are revitalised in Southern Italy.

 Mr President, Commissioner de Palacio, – both of you fortunately Spanish – on this very important point, the Erika 
in December 1999 and the Prestige
 in November 2002 have already been mentioned as two disasters that were followed by all words and no action, though certainly not from the Commission who – as has already been said – did in fact do a great deal. What we deplore is, instead, that there is still no overall legislation on protection of the environment through criminal law and, in fact, the conflict between the Council and the Commission, with the well-known subsequent appeal to the Court of Justice has crushed hopes, at least for us environmentalists. On the other hand, in the specific area of maritime pollution – this has already been said, and there is no need to repeat it – the proposal for a directive is extremely worthy of praise, as was Mr Pex’s work, which made considerable improvements to it. I believe, however, that this directive will only have an impact if there is the political will to enforce it, especially because recent history teaches us that European Union directives are almost always disregarded by Member States. The real issue is the lack of will on the part of Member States to respect these provisions and the fact that, I am sorry to say, immediate corrective action has to be taken today when there have been terrible disasters. The proposed framework decision is merely a complementary decision to the directive. There is an excellent agreement, and it is, therefore, necessary that both are welcomed by Parliament with all the amendments tabled which are, in my view, excellent, although I have some reservations as regards the European Coastguard, since the sketchy proposal for this body gives us some cause for concern. The substance of this directive does, however, go in the right direction although it must be made clear that this will not be enough unless there is an overall framework to protect the environment in general and without which maritime protection will continue to be granted a lower level of protection. We need to return to overall community legislation on the environment as a whole and I believe that the Council should be reasonable and adopt the proposal for a directive on protection of the environment through criminal law, which, I repeat, was blocked by an appeal to the Court of Justice. This would be an excellent step because we would have adequate maritime protection, which would, however, be within the framework of environmental protection that could be equally protected at a criminal level, since there is no doubt that criminal sanctions are most likely to make workers in the sector adapt to provisions. In my view, this directive goes in the right direction and does some justice to all the workers because it will bring many workers under full control that were hitherto excluded. We know very well that international conventions excluded from liability ship-owners and a whole range of people who were, in actual fact, directly and indirectly responsible, and we saw proof of this with the Prestige
, where the only one to pay was a poor captain of a Greek vessel who, at least, did everything possible to avoid the disaster, whilst others should be charged regarding the Erika 
disaster and its repercussions.
 I therefore agree both with the report on the proposal for a directive and the report on the proposal for a framework decision, and I hope that Parliament will adopt them both.

 Mr President, our parliamentary group is totally in favour of a Members’ Statute. We have always been convinced that we need to establish a Statute that guarantees equal political and financial dignity for the representatives of Europe’s citizens. To this end, we have consistently followed and actively supported all the steps that have led to the current proposal now under discussion in the Council. I would also like to say, quite clearly, that we are opposed to any delaying tactics. The Confederal Group of the European United Left/Nordic Green Left calls for this Statute to be approved as soon as possible. We feel that the principle of equality between MEPs is a necessary element of justice and transparency for our citizens. Obviously, as is the case for all compromise proposals, we are not entirely satisfied with the one under examination, but we will not fail to make a constructive contribution, which will be open to dialogue between all the Parliamentary groups. The issue that is still a matter of disagreement is the age of retirement. The current proposal is to give MEPs a pension at the age of 63, while the Confederal Group of the European United Left believes that the age should be lowered to 60. This proposal does not aim to protect the privileges of MEPs; we are putting forward the proposal because we are convinced that all European citizens should retire at the age of 60, at the very latest. My colleagues and I have always opposed reform of pension schemes based on an increase in the contributions period, which I consider to be unfair. We are convinced that there are sufficient financial resources to enable all European citizens, including MEPs, who are citizens like everyone else, to retire at the age of 60. As regards the principle of the single salary, we are convinced that it represents a principle of democracy and equal treatment. Why should an MEP from Estonia be paid far less than a German? At the same time, however, we realise that, in certain Member States of the European Union, this could give rise to untenable situations, where an MEP receives a salary several times greater than that of their President. This is why we have to be politically flexible. Perhaps we could close the gap between differing remuneration of MEPs by basing it on the monthly salaries of senior State offices in that particular country; but, for us, the principle of the single across-the-board salary is an irrevocable one. Finally, as regards the payment of the travelling expenses of MEPs, we would like to remind you that the Bureau 
of the European Parliament has drawn up a proposal that a majority in my group has asked to see put into practice when the Statute comes into force

Mr President, Amendment No 41, upon which we are about to vote, contains a misunderstanding. It is not the fault of the staff; there is a misunderstanding in the translation, which, as it stands, means that the amendment makes no sense. The final part states: ‘deplores, in particular, the preparation by the EU and the United Kingdom of bilateral agreements with the United States, agreements which authorise the Member States to extradite persons condemned to death to the United States.. Therefore, in order to make sense, the amendment should read as follows: ‘extradite those citizens liable to be punished with the death penalty in the United States’.

 Madam President, the proposal for a directive on the right of European citizens and their families to free movement and residence within the territory of the Member States marks a key point in the creation of a freer, more open Europe, and it endeavours, moreover, to simplify and streamline a veritable spider’s web of provisions on employees and the self-employed, pensioners, students and citizens who simply wish to live in a country other than their own. Then the amendments adopted in the Committee on Citizens’ Freedoms and Rights, Justice and Home Affairs have improved the original text considerably, providing greater legal certainty for workers and protecting them from the dangers of illegal immigration. Of course, European citizens should be protected from these dangers too. Certainly, a great deal remains to be done, as Mrs Karamanou and Mr Medina Ortega have made clear. In addressing the expectations of family members who wish to live outside their own country, we have been working, not least, towards a genuine increase in civil liberties, eliminating discrimination on the basis of gender identity, sexual orientation or form of cohabitation. We are convinced that, just as rights such as the right to divorce or to have an abortion are ingrained in the psyche of the majority of Europeans, so there is also a clear need to make effective the right of those who wish to live in a country other than their own, who wish to live alone or with a same-sex partner or to build a family without being forced to marry. I do not know whether the Council will decide or be able to preserve the political and cultural balance of Parliament’s decisions, whether it will endorse the report in the form adopted by the Committee on Citizens’ Freedoms and Rights, but we are sure that, should it fail to do so, it would be acting against the wishes of the majority of the Union’s citizens, as Mrs Terrón i Cusí has said, with the danger of widening the gap between institutions and people.

 Mr President, three or four days ago, the Italian police handed over an Iraqi family to the liberal democrat government of Syria. The head of the family had been condemned to death 20 years ago for belonging to the organisation known as Muslim Brothers. We fear that the sentence might already have been carried out in Syria. This family was held at Malpensa airport for five days, was not allowed to have any contact with any other people and was then sent back to Syria without being informed of their right to apply for asylum. I call upon the European Parliament and its President to ask for more detailed information from the Italian Government.

 Madam President, Commissioner, in my opinion and in the opinion of the majority of the committee, I would imagine, the two related reports before us this evening have been prepared with undue haste. Their quality is certainly not in keeping with the legal traditions of Europe and its Member States. The two reports focus in particular on the approximation of laws on the confiscation of crime-related proceeds, instrumentalities and property. They specifically concern the possibility of extensive powers of confiscation, in other words the confiscation not so much and not only of the proceeds of the crime itself but also of all the other property in the possession of a person sentenced to a very long prison sentence who cannot prove that the property is of lawful origin. This part of the report, Commissioner Vitorino, was deleted by the committee, and what remains is therefore the possibility of confiscating crime-related proceeds. However, a framework decision is not necessary to achieve this result in the European Community, for the legislation of almost all the European countries provides for the compulsory confiscation of crime-related proceeds or, at least, makes this possible. Precisely in order to overcome the committee’s difficulties in accepting the inversion of the onus of proof – Amendment No 11, amending Article 3(1) – I suggested, by means of an amendment which is very reminiscent of the Italian legislation on the subject, the possibility of confiscating additional property – the property subject precisely to extended powers of confiscation – only where the prosecution has proved that the property possessed is disproportionate to the activity pursued or, in any case, exceeds the person’s income as declared for tax purposes. The person convicted would then have the chance to prove the lawful origin of the property. The provisions were 
therefore toned down but the onus of proof not actually inverted. The committee was disconcerted, surprised, confused by this, and therefore rejected my amendment. I therefore call upon the House to adopt this amendment, for this is the only way to include in the legislation extensive powers of confiscation, which is one of the goals of the proposal and, in my opinion, also a useful tool for combating organised crime. It is based on a dual principle. The prosecution has to prove that the person’s property is disproportionate: in other words, it has to prove that the value of the property exceeds the person’s real 
activities and their income as declared for tax purposes, while the person convicted has the option to prove that this property is of lawful origin. If, however, the report remains in the form adopted by the committee, it will be absolutely useless, for – I stress – the European countries already have similar legislation in place and do not need a European Parliament framework decision.

 Madam President, until a few years ago, any attempt at dialogue with the Council or the Commission over Echelon would be cut short on the pretext that it was just a rumour in the press on which there was no comment to be made. After the work of the Echelon committee, the European Union finally acknowledged this interception system exists, and the subject of this debate – as Mrs Flesch rightly pointed out at the beginning of the debate – is Echelon. Nothing more, nothing less, so let us not beat about the bush. I have nothing more to say, except that, having heard Mr von Boetticher and all the other Members speak, I associate myself with what they have said and agree with them, for they have already given a comprehensive picture of what was not done after that work had been carried out. We poured time and human resources into the issue but we have very little to show for it, for, until today, neither the Commission nor the Council have made any effort to protect the citizens. There is another dimension to the problem: companies and institutions, with all the human and material resources available to them, are quite able to protect themselves, but the real message of the Echelon committee was that the citizens and their privacy need to be protected, that there is a fundamental right to privacy. Well then, thus far, nothing has been done in Europe in this area and I feel that the failure of the institutions and Parliament itself to take any practical steps regarding Echelon and the matter of interception of communications damages their legitimacy. The legitimacy of our institutions is truly diminished by this. If I may be so bold, it is my opinion that the Council and the Commission should, at least, consider drawing up a framework decision protecting the citizens from arbitrary interception of communications and giving them the right to plead their cause before a court, to appeal to a national court for prosecution of these types of interception.

. – We agree fully on the need to fight racism and xenophobia and welcome that the European Commission recognises the need to fight racism and xenophobia. We will, however, not support the Ceyhun report for several reasons. Firstly, the report leaves little if any attention to the political fight against racism and xenophobia, and focuses primarily on the judicial action to be taken. However, racism and xenophobic attacks and discriminations occur in the social and economic spheres and must be countered by measures to abolish such discriminations, which exist also in institutionalised forms. An approach strictly limited to criminal law cannot be considered sufficient in the fight against racism and xenophobia. Secondly, the focus of the report is on legal restrictions on racist and xenophobic beliefs
 and not on the actions
 motivated by racism and xenophobia. Criminalising what people think amounts to attempted censorship and diverts attention from violent criminal attacks on people of colour and foreigners. Instead of a "mind-policing-approach" we would support a hate-crime-legislation approach that considers racist and xenophobic motives for a crime an aggravating circumstance and increases sanctions on these crimes.

 President-in-Office Haarder, I do not think the Council wanted to consider the fact that the PKK has dissolved itself, that it has not committed any more armed actions and that many of its leading members have handed themselves over to the Turks. It is absurd to have included the PKK on the list of terrorists, particularly in view of these recent events that I have mentioned, and this will encourage Turkey to be even more cruel towards the Kurds; it will prevent any further peace agreement and will exacerbate the situation. I must emphasise the fact that the PKK was included on this list at the moment when it had unilaterally started to respect the human rights of the Turkish people far more than Turkey itself. I therefore believe that the Council should reconsider its decision and remove the PKK from the terrorist list, particularly because its members are no longer terrorists.

 We confirm our unreserved commitment to combating all forms of terrorism and voted for the amendments we tabled together with the other groups, because they could – by providing for appeal to the European Court of Justice – provide legal protection for the European citizens. The names of some of the citizens have already been included in the list annexed to the regulation, even though no evidence has been produced of their connection to terrorist movements or involvement in terrorist activities. However, we voted against the regulation, both because of the procedure employed – this is the fourth time we have voted on terrorism with an urgent procedure, without a report and without a debate – and because of the content of the regulation, for we are voting on a list of names given to the UN by the CIA with no evidence and no possibility of our having access to any evidence there may be. The procedures for drawing up the list of natural and legal persons, groups and entities laid down in Article 2 of the regulation clearly violate the sacrosanct rules on the right of defence of EU citizens – also enshrined in the recently proclaimed Charter of Fundamental Rights – introducing a freeze on the financial assets and resources of those concerned without any possibility of democratic and/or judicial monitoring of the evidence on the basis of which they are included on the list. I therefore call upon the Council to take into consideration the amendments adopted by Parliament, at least, and to make the necessary changes to the proposal for a regulation.

 Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, we are all quite familiar with the history of this framework decision. We are being consulted a second time because the framework decision, on which we first expressed our opinion two years ago, has been revised. In the meantime, however, the Commission expressed a general reservation about the framework decision, to the effect that environmental protection is covered by a large number of Community acts, most of which make provisions for administrative penalties, and that the issue should therefore be dealt with by means of a first-pillar instrument. The Commission insists that, given the environmental degradation in the Union, existing penalties are clearly inadequate. The proposal for a directive, which is the subject of Mrs Oomen-Ruijten’s report, must therefore be seen as complementing the draft framework decision. According to the Commission, a first-pillar instrument must be adopted which takes precedence over a third-pillar instrument. That means that, when an area falls within the Community sphere of responsibility, it is legally impossible for the Union to adopt common rules by means of a third-pillar instrument without encroaching on the Community’s powers. I would point out that Parliament agrees with the Commission on this point: in the sitting of 15 November 2001, with a procedure without debate, we adopted a recommendation on criminal penalties and Community acts, point 6 of which, to be precise, called upon the Council not to undertake any action concerning criminal law in the field of the environment before the proposal for a directive on the protection of the environment through criminal law had been adopted. Now then, these two documents – the framework decision and the directive – complement each other and are designed to be used together, so as to avoid inconsistency with two documents saying different things about the same subject. As you will see in the amendments, the framework decision refers precisely to the directive as regards the definitions and penalties, for we are convinced that the directive is the instrument we need, precisely because it is a Community instrument, if we are to protect the environment from destruction. I would like to draw your attention to an additional, very important consideration: whereas the directive appears to be based on the approach of preventive protection of the environment, that is protection which takes place before the environment is completely destroyed, the framework decision proposed by the Council would, in actual fact, only impose criminal sanctions once the environment has already suffered destruction or, at any rate, irreparable damage. Here, we do not, of course, have enough time available, but in committee we have already outlined this difference of approach quite clearly. I therefore stress that we must endorse both the framework decision, which has already been approved in committee, and the directive, for, as they stand, these two documents complement each other. If, however, we were to adopt a decision which was inconclusive as regards the basic approach or, worse still, if we were to adopt Amendment No 28 to Mrs Oomen-Ruijten’s report, which completely rejects the Commission’s proposal, we would cause the two documents to be totally inconsistent. We therefore need to agree on the complementary nature of these two instruments and adopt them both in their current forms.

 Madam President, as the Confederal Group of the European United Left/Nordic Green Left, we are against the extension of the Monday sitting, which will serve only to get the anti-terrorism package approved. This package was presented in the Committee on Citizens’ Freedoms and Rights, Justice and Home Affairs this morning, but we could not proceed to the discussion because of the very tight deadlines, and no report was drawn up. I think it is worrying that Parliament should express an opinion without first having drawn up a report on such an important subject. We are therefore against this shortening of deadlines, because it simply does not allow us to present a reasoned report on such an important subject.

 Mr President, I should just like to speak about the draft extradition agreement between the European Union and the United States. On 7 December 2000, at Nice, we signed, proclaimed and upheld the Charter of European Citizens’ Rights. It is very clearly stated in Article 2, under the heading of dignity, that nobody may be condemned to death or be executed; the Charter thus makes a clear distinction between the two things and states that, for us European citizens, a prohibition on being executed is not enough and a prohibition on being condemned to death is also necessary. Well, we are committing ourselves to cooperation with the United States, which has kept the death penalty, condemns people to death and applies the death penalty, has a justice system that uses military courts, and detains thousands of Arabs without charge and without defence. We are about to vote on a joint resolution with the other groups – we, of course, will vote against it – stating that extradition may be granted provided the United States guarantees that the death penalty will not be applied; that means that the United States courts may issue capital sentences provided they then refrain from applying them, and all that in spite of the Charter of civil, human and fundamental rights that we have been highlighting so much recently. We are opening up an enormous breach in our defences against the death penalty. Friends from the People’s Party, Greens, Socialists, British Liberals, take care! We are saying we can extradite our citizens to be condemned to death in the United States even if that country then undertakes not to apply the sentence! It is a complete break with our tradition; it is a complete break with our commitment! Today, we heard Commissioner Vitorino give a speech full of references to our values and our principles. What, then, are our values and principles? Extradition to a country that will condemn European citizens to death? I appeal to your feelings, but also to your moral integrity. We must vote against this resolution!

 Madam President, there is an ongoing relationship between the constraints on individual and collective freedoms in the United States and those in Europe, just as there is an ongoing connection in the matter of such freedoms that has been maintained by the United Kingdom government, first with the Reagan/Thatcher partnership and now with the Bush/Blair partnership. Many European governments are using the criminal terrorist action of 11 September against the United States as an excuse to issue further legislation curbing freedoms which has nothing to do with combating terrorism. Leaving aside the special military tribunals set up by President Bush, it is enough to reflect upon the recent laws issued or proposed in Italy or in the United Kingdom in order to understand that their objective is to curb and control growing political opposition to a world social and economic order which is unfair and inhuman: the wealth, well-being, growth and development of a fifth of the human race are mirrored by the starvation, lack of resources, ongoing economic decline and underdevelopment of the other four fifths. It is strange that we can never manage to find a legal formula to define this major social massacre as an act of terrorism, while we had no hesitation in labelling as terrorist acts all those demonstrations of social opposition which have taken place recently in Seattle, Genoa and so forth. Article 3 of the proposal for a framework decision on terrorism sends a clear message to all those who, in the future, attempt to show their opposition to the neo-liberal monopoly on thinking and the resulting social system. Women, men, workers, students, the unemployed, pacifists and ecologists will no longer be opposing the system but will be terrorists because – as Hegel, then an old man, wrongly said – ‘the real is rational and the rational real’, and for our legislators nothing is more real than the present social and economic disorder and nothing is more irrational, and therefore terrorist, than the need to overthrow and eliminate it. Lastly, I would like to make it clear that I do support the European arrest warrant and that, as an Italian, I condemn the fact that my country’s government should be the one to oppose a unanimous decision. It is shameful because the intention of the Berlusconi government in adopting this position is to prevent corruption being listed among the offences on the ‘positive’ list.

 Madam President, once again, we declare our condemnation of any form of terrorism, whatever its source. As well as destroying human life, terrorism takes any possibility or capacity for democratic initiative away from the huge numbers of men and women who are fighting to change the unjust social and economic system of this world. Moreover, we condemn any attempt to assert the non-existent superiority of the moral, cultural or political systems of the communities of the European Union over other communities. We believe that, at this moment in history, one of the ways in which the European Union can combat and isolate any form of violence is to make a concerted effort to achieve the objective of giving the peoples of Israel and Palestine two autonomous, sovereign States, as stipulated in all those UN resolutions which Israel has been violating for years. The internal security of the Union must be reinforced – and I agree with much of what Mr Watson said – but always and only in respect for fundamental rights and the constraints of the rule of law. Therefore, any extension of the competences or spheres of operation of bodies such as Europol or Eurojust must go hand in hand with the creation of a system of judicial and, most importantly, democratic controls, with Parliament playing an active role. Any attempt to use the danger represented by terrorism to restrict or eliminate, by any means including Union or national legislative instruments, the huge democratic waves of dissent and opposition to the dominant social and economic system which are now sweeping through Europe and the world, must therefore be rejected, just as those legislative practices also referred to by Mr Barón Crespo such as the Italian laws on international letters rogatory, which are of practical assistance to terrorist and organised crime groups, must be condemned. We hope that the fight against terrorism, which is a crime against humanity, will increasingly be seen as the responsibility of the entire international community, that is of the UN, rather than the responsibility of a small number of wealthy, powerful nations who often use their wealth and power not to combat terrorism and its causes but to consolidate 
their economic and political power. The fact that the majority of the people in the world live in a state of despair, poverty and underdevelopment can never justify terrorism – never. This situation must be fought and eradicated by action, not just formal declarations, if we want our world to be at peace. This is another area in which we must take action if we genuinely want to eliminate terrorism. (Applause)

 Mr President, I was present at the committee’s meeting this morning, and I would therefore like to add to what the Chairman, Mr Watson, has said. There was substantial concern regarding precisely the request for urgency – there were even three votes cast against the motion and three abstentions – because we are being asked to approve an urgent procedure not on the mechanism for identifying money launderers but on a list. It is with regard to this fact that we expressed our opposition.

 Mr President, while stating that our Group is fully in agreement with the Evans report, I should, however, like to highlight two aspects. First, the procedure for examining refugee applications needs to be speeded up. Member States should be aware that many of their problems, but especially many of the immigrant refugees’ problems, would be overcome if these applications were dealt with quickly. A great many refugees – a great many people who have every right to be recognised as such – wait for months or years without receiving aid, deprived of work, gradually sliding towards illegality and often sucked into areas of organised and other crime. It is therefore necessary to shorten these excessively long time periods. Secondly, it is important to understand and establish the fact that the notion of a ‘safe country’ is one that may be overturned by specific evidence of the treatment an individual receives in his or her country. I mean that the notion of a safe country must be a relative assumption, because many refugees flee from a safe country because they are personally persecuted. This notion must not, therefore, be an absolute notion, but the conditions to which the individual refugees have been subjected – in other words, the conditions that have led them to flee to another country – should be examined on a case-by-case basis, and they may lead to the above-mentioned notion of a safe third country being overturned.

 Commissioner, I reiterate that European legislation does exist on this matter and it must be respected, that the specifications of the new tunnel are practically the same as those of the previous tunnel, that 97% of the community of Chamonix have declared that they are against the reopening of the tunnel – which will inevitably damage all the private businesses, polluting all the typical, customary economic activities of these communities now and in future – and that the Italian government is preparing to reduce the night-time toll, thus increasing the pollution. What guarantees does the European legislation protecting the environment offer these communities?

Mr President, Echelon is an interception system which does not differentiate between communications, data and documents. It does exist and represents a considerable step forwards. From now on, the Union’s institutions, particularly the representatives of the Council and the Commission, will no longer be able to say that information reported in the media is inaccurate. There is, however, inconsistency between what has been ascertained and the conclusions of the report, for the system flagrantly infringes the fundamental right to privacy guaranteed by Article 8 of the European Convention on Human Rights and Article 6 of the Treaty on European Union. In fact, because of its technical capabilities, the system nullifies the relationship of proportionality which, precisely within the meaning of Article 8 of the European Convention on Human Rights, has to exist between interference in people’s private lives and the benefits of interception for protection purposes. This is all the more serious in that interception is currently carried out by means of these technical capabilities by a third country on EU territory and to the detriment of the citizens of the countries of the Union, without the possibility of any sort of legal, administrative or parliamentary control. A further problem is that one of the countries managing the Echelon system is the United Kingdom, a Member of the European Union, while other Member States such as Germany have made their territory available for the siting of antennae, listening posts and other equipment. Quite simply, the group of English-speaking countries managing Echelon is doing what it likes with the privacy of European citizens, as is explicitly noted in point 26 of the conclusion, cited by Mrs Flesch moreover, which means that Article 8 of the European Convention on Human Rights is being infringed. However, rather than trusting the United Kingdom not to abuse the information, we should at least have recorded its infringement of this article and noted the fact that its participation in the Echelon system is incompatible with its responsibilities under the European Treaties. Genuine safeguarding of fundamental rights in the USA is essential for the credibility and democratic legitimacy of that country. However, we have, yet again, chosen to 
waste an opportunity, at least for us, to uphold a democratic principle. For others, on the other hand, at a historic moment when great, dark clouds are gathering over the right to dissent in the EU and at world level – as we have learnt from Genoa – it would be unthinkable to abolish or at least attempt to modify and reduce the capabilities of an indiscriminate listening system, one of the most useful systems for social monitoring and, where necessary, crime prevention. Mr President, this report and its failure to draw the appropriate conclusions reduce the fundamental right to privacy, so solemnly enshrined in our Treaties and in the Charter of Fundamental Rights, to a right which only exists on paper, or rather to a right which, tragically, is worth no more than the paper it is written on.

 Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, the mutual recognition of final decisions in criminal matters poses many problems, which we have tried to face and solve in the best way possible, thanks also to the input from the Committee on Legal Affairs and the Internal Market and its draftsman, Mr Joachim Wuermeling. This report has not had any amendments, and this is evidence of the solidarity we felt over the proposal. I hope the solutions proposed may find a broad consensus in Parliament in order to give greater strength to the arguments of all those in the Council and the Commission of the European Union that share them. A common area of justice will only make sense if, within it, the court decisions of one Member State are effective in all the other Member States. In concrete terms the intention is to allow the execution in one Member State of a final decision issued by the competent authority of another Member State. Until today, the recognition of decisions among the various Member States has been achieved through the request mechanism, a slow, complicated process with an even more uncertain outcome. In addition to the obvious aim of legal certainty inherent in the rapid and effective implementation of the law throughout the territory of the Union, mutual recognition seeks to achieve not only the social rehabilitation of those sentenced, who are no longer uprooted from the country in which they have chosen to live, but also the protection of victims’ rights. In order to set up a mutual recognition mechanism, two possible solutions could be put forward: either moving towards harmonisation of the legislative and judicial systems in the Member States, or basing the mechanism on mutual trust in the adequacy of the laws of individual states and the proper implementation of those laws in specific proceedings. We have opted for this latter solution, both because it is more feasible and because we are faced with legal systems which, although diverse, are based on a system of procedural rules that guarantee criminal decisions which are reliable and hence amenable to being enforced throughout the territory of the Union. We are, however, aware that, at least in the short term, it will be difficult to reach an agreement on a procedure for automatic recognition, since no Member State will ever be willing to associate itself with recognition of any final decision that does not respect certain essential common guarantees. The question is, precisely, that of the identification of these essential guarantees, such as respect for the principle of ne bis in idem
, or respect for the right to an effective and not simply a pro forma
 defence, or respect for victims’ rights. It will also be necessary to have common rules on jurisdiction and competence in order, above all, to prevent duplicated proceedings, just as there must be common rules for the application of penalties for re-offending or for the accumulation of penalties. It will, however, be necessary to remove some obstacles that today prevent full recognition of final decisions in criminal matters, and among these obstacles are the requirement of dual criminality, which often allows the competent authority in the enforcing state to re-examine the decision issued by the authority of another Member State in both form and substance. The dual criminality problem must be put into perspective since, in all Member States of the Union, the acts that arouse the greatest social condemnation are subject to criminal sanctions. There is still the option – favoured by many of us – not to apply mutual recognition to a limited number of crimes, such as euthanasia, on which it would be difficult to reach an agreement. This report signals a first step towards the creation of the common area of justice, freedom and security. The course has been traced out; now we need to find the will and the political strength to press on to the end, elevating the guarantee system to the highest possible level.

 Mr President, the European Union is finally realising that there are serious social problems underlying the tragic situation in Columbia, specifically the need for the fair redistribution of wealth and land between the few who have everything and the many who have nothing. Clinton and Pastrana's ‘Plan Columbia’, which reinforces military structures for combating drug trafficking, has the effect of preserving this social imbalance, just as the paramilitaries, loyal allies of the Pastrana army and drug traffickers, preserve it. It is no coincidence that Carlos Castaño is friendly with the government and is head of the drug traffickers and paramilitaries. It is no coincidence, while the paramilitaries are murdering peasant farmers and political and democratic representatives, that, under the pretence of fighting drug trafficking, American spray 
planes 
are destroying the harvests with fumigation and forcing peasant farmers to leave their villages. If the European Union genuinely believes in the provisions of its Treaties and its recent Charter on justice and human rights, it must support the social claims of the Colombian people and oppose ‘Plan Columbia’, for it is a plan for war, not for peace. Ladies and gentlemen of the European Union, if no genuine redistribution of land is carried out in Columbia, even European Union aid will end up lining the pockets of the drug traffickers, of the large land owners and multinationals. This tragedy is about the redistribution of land and fair social justice.

 Mr President, it would be hard to deny that, for some years now, the social policies of the States of the Union have been conditioned by economic and monetary policies, by budgetary concerns, by the Stability Pacts and by the flexible and precarious nature of employment, in homage to the great god of the marketplace and to competition, his inseparable companion. The divide between those who have much and those who have little or nothing is growing ever wider, while, precisely in the name of these sacred principles, those who have much are exacting increasing sacrifices from those who have little or nothing. The Charter of Fundamental Rights, with its constant referral to national laws and practices for the actual implementation of social rights, is liable to render irreversible this subordination, this unfair system of the wealthy few, this model of a liberal free trade 
society which is rising like a phoenix from the ashes of European social democratic ideals with striking speed. This Charter on social rights is a step backwards compared to the laws of many of the Member States and, thanks precisely to the referrals to these laws, it will serve as a tool to alter them or limit their effectiveness. Civil and political rights are empty, formal rights if they are merely listed in a document and not based on actual social rights. It appears that the century which is coming to a close, with all its battles to emancipate the under-privileged social classes, has been in vain and has taught us nothing. We cannot pretend that this Charter is an initial step towards a Union based on increasing solidarity. Rather, it is the bare minimum in terms of future social policies. I only hope that it will not be incorporated into the Treaties and that movements calling for a fairer Europe, in which there is a genuine increase in solidarity, will flourish in civil society, in the trade unions and in political organisations.

 Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, I feel that this Action Plan is a major step forward in the fight against discrimination, partly because, in these so very complex times, in the highly complex societies we live in, discrimination takes many other forms which are ever more unexpected and give ever greater cause for concern I would like to focus on one point of the Action Plan which, as I said in committee, I feel leaves large gaps: the inclusion of Turkey. It is not that Turkey should not be included in this Action Plan, but we are financing a State – which I may define as criminal – without any insistence at all that these funds should be used to eradicate the worst form of discrimination, namely discrimination against the Kurdish-speaking Turkish citizens. Therefore, we are providing funds for Turkey to use as it likes without any obligation to eliminate the worst form of discrimination, which is a combination of all forms of discrimination in that, if there is discrimination against Kurds in general now, discrimination against Kurdish women, people of Kurdish origin with deviant sexual tendencies and disabled people of Kurdish origin will soon follow. There you are. We would have liked to compel or, at any rate, prompt Turkey to eradicate the genuinely widespread discrimination currently practised in that State. We are therefore extremely confused regarding this point, and we call upon the Commission to ensure, when monitoring the ways that the funding is used, that Turkey is not merely pretending to wipe out or combat more minor forms of discrimination without making any effort at all to fight that basic discrimination which, when all is said and done, is at the root of a great many of Europe's misfortunes.

 Mr President, the framework decision put forward by the Council merely reproduces the Council of Europe Convention of 1998 on the 
prevention of environmental crime, a Convention which has not yet been ratified by any of the Member States of the Council of Europe. The sole purpose of this proposal for a framework decision is to speed things up, at least with regard to the 15 Member States.  In almost every country environmental laws are based almost entirely on very small fines, and this encourages those who are destroying the environment to maximise their profits by trying to avoid using all the modern techniques available to protect the environment. And so, in recent years we have witnessed major disasters such as that of the Erika
, which was a rust bucket 
used to transport crude oil by sea, or the pollution of the Danube with cyanide from Romanian mines. And all this because, as I was saying, these big companies are guaranteed impunity, with the aim of maximising profits.  First of all, this framework decision allows European countries to raise fines to make this offence – environmental crime – unprofitable. Indeed, until such time as environmental crime is paid for by the community and not by individuals, there is no hope of protecting the environment.  Another area where this framework decision impacts is that of encouraging European countries to adopt sanctions, or at least a system making environmental crime a punishable offence for legal persons. Few European countries provide for the liability of legal persons in their criminal law, but others are taking steps towards this. Italy too, in revising the new penal code, intends to make legal persons punishable, because today serious environmental crime is not committed by individuals but by large multinationals, which cause huge disasters simply because they do not invest in prevention.  European countries should agree on fairly general regulations soon and, in any case, raise fines so that these offences are not paid for out of the community’s pocket.  Another important aspect is the cooperation that this framework decision will bring about between countries: an information network enabling a rapid exchange of information and an agreement which requires environmental crime to be considered as a crime that may lead to extradition or for example the confiscation of property and profits, and which, in any case, makes these offences unprofitable. I would just like to point out that the committee approved this report almost unanimously, with only one abstention, and all the political groups, from the PPE to the PSE to the Greens, contributed to improving it.  This report therefore expresses the point of view of the Committee on Citizens’ Freedoms, and, we hope, expresses the point of view of the European Parliament, which must ensure that the European countries at last adopt effective legislation on the protection of the environment.

 Mr President, we fully support Mrs Paciotti’s report and its conclusions. The ‘safe harbour’ agreement would mean that we would have to transfer data to American businesses, companies and corporations without the possibility of recourse to an independent authority in the event of improper or illegal use of the data, and that we would therefore not even be protected by those minimal guarantees which exist in the Union. During the hearing held by the Committee on Citizens’ Freedoms and Rights, Justice and Home Affairs, we took on board the concerns of the representatives of American consumers regarding the inadequacy of the American protection system and we also noted the need, expressed by President Clinton, for the United States to introduce an organic law on the protection of personal data. If we adopt this report, we will not only be expressing our political will to succeed in concluding an agreement containing protection clauses which respect European legislation, but we will also be encouraging a large proportion of Congress and of United States’ public opinion to develop personal data protection laws. If such laws are not produced and the changes called for in the Paciotti report are not made, we may as well call the agreement with the United States the ‘dangerous harbour’ agreement.

 Mr President, I would like to thank Mrs Sörensen for her report, which contains many proposals, and for the emphasis placed on the fact that trafficking in women and children is a violation of human rights. The body and the human person are not commodities. Even though many women choose to become prostitutes as an easy way of making a living, I would make no distinction between voluntary and forced prostitution: all prostitution is exploitation.  I would like to stress three points: firstly, trafficking and immigration. A closed border policy prompts immigrants to turn to criminal organisations in order to procure visas or enter the country concerned illegally. The Member States must develop a more united, responsible policy. Thirdly: the victims’ rights. It was proposed that the European Union issue temporary residence permits to victims which would be conditional upon the victims giving evidence against the traffickers, but, as yet, Italy is the only State to issue permits which are not conditional upon the giving of evidence.  I would like to finish by raising the question of clients. Commissioner Vitorino repeatedly stated the need to take into account the demand of this market, that is the clients. But who are the clients? They could be our fathers, our sons or ourselves. It is our duty to do our part to bring about a radical change in the mentality and culture of our society. This means promoting policies which support women.

Mr President, the Convention on Mutual Assistance in Criminal Matters that we are examining today contains the minimum requirements for efficient and rapid cooperation between the various judicial or investigative bodies concerned. It pertains, among other things, to notifications, information exchanges, the temporary transfer of detainees, the restitution of property, testimonies via video conferences, investigative activities and ‘undercover’ activities, and the interception of telephone calls. This is the bare minimum on which an agreement can be reached, and it should immediately be said that if any amendments, such as Amendments Nos 32 or 81, or the revised Amendments Nos 70 or 71, were to be passed, the whole convention would be reduced to an exchange of notifications or information and at this point should simply be scrapped, and we would vote against it. I hope that the common sense of our fellow MEPs in the other groups will lead them to reject these amendments. The fact that the convention has not been turned into a framework agreement also constitutes a defeat for this Parliament. As Commissioner Vitorino will have noted in all the various speeches, the need has emerged to draw up a framework of common rules, which is to say that we cannot continue in this manner, with this disparate agenda, with these piecemeal agreements which relate to diverse sectors such as that of investigation. What is, on the other hand, absolutely necessary is to have a bare minimum of set rules that are valid within the Community, and which clearly provide as many additional safeguards as possible, and will also provide guarantees with a view to enlargement. My thoughts turn to what may become of this Community, of these conventions and judicial relations if, for example, a fascist country such as Turkey became a member of the Union. It would truly perplex me. We need a corpus iuris 
– as everyone has said – and common rules, especially procedural ones, which guarantee the rule of common law throughout the Community. It is clear that this is primarily an issue for the IGC and one that addresses an aspiration to which this Parliament can only make a limited contribution in as much as everything depends on the Council and the Commission. I believe that this first half of the year, in which we have a Commissioner from Portugal and Portuguese Presidency of the Council, provides an excellent opportunity to give an initial spur to this shared aspiration. It is precisely for this reason that we are in favour of adopting Amendments Nos 78 and 79, which already prefigure a minimum of set rules on interceptions and on video conferences. On the one hand, we eagerly await the successful outcome of this vote, precisely so that this convention – which, I repeat, already sets minimum rules – is not stripped of all meaning, while on the other hand we are also looking forward to any form of proposal that may arrive from the Commission with a view to definitively putting into effect this minimum Community law.

 Mr President, we are basically in favour of the resolution that has been tabled, even if we think that this can only be interpreted as an invitation by Parliament to the Council to amend the Treaties, so that effective protection under criminal law of the Union’s financial interests can be guaranteed.  The establishment of a European Public Prosecutor’s Office and the definition of offences common to all countries of the Union is doubtless a good idea, but it is impossible to consider putting this into practice without having first introduced a European legal system. Indeed, we are talking about criminal law, the area where resistance that national States put up to communitisation is, and will be, fierce. Indeed, it is unthinkable that we could put in place substantial and procedural legal regulations solely for one sector – that of the protection of financial interests – without first having created a European legal system. Reading the precise and comprehensive explanations in the Theato report makes you realise just how many problems still need to be resolved and what these problems are. In any case, this idea must be encouraged, and it will doubtless be during this attempt to protect financial interests that we realise that we need to include a Community corpus iuris
 in the Treaties. On behalf of my group, but also personally, I hope that the vital financial spirit of the Union will pave the way for the creation of a European legal system which respects citizens’ rights and guarantees, which is to say a legal system that will raise guarantees to the acceptable levels hitherto unseen in many States. Therefore, on behalf of my group, I would like to say that we support the Theato report; I nevertheless think that this is essentially a subject that should be included on the IGC agenda.

Madam President, I do not believe I am the only one to be disappointed by the results of the Tampere summit. It is true that it could have been worse, much worse, especially for the citizens of third countries who are in Europe or who need to come here, but that does not change the fact that we have missed a good opportunity to actually start constructing an area of freedom, security and justice. The Summit’s conclusions seem to be a summary of the preparatory documents which had already been in circulation in Parliament for some time, without any more detail being added. There was a long list of good intentions with which we cannot disagree, but I am concerned and perplexed by some of the clearer decisions. I will give only one example out of the many I could give – the priority given to cooperation in fighting urban youth crime seems a little odd and out of place, given that, to make any real impact, the States would do better to join forces in order to defeat large-scale organised crime, which increasingly operates on an international basis. We will only be able to find out more from the legislative proposals that will be put forward. In the meantime, we repeat our concern that what we will actually achieve is an area of internal security fitted with an iron lock to stop the outside world getting in.

 Mr President, on the night of 27 June 1980, off the coast of Ustica, 81 innocent European citizens who were flying from Bologna to Palermo, lost their lives in the course of a military operation which involved the civilian airliner in which they were travelling. A few minutes after the disaster, the military and secret service machinery of the countries concerned – with the Italians leading the way – were already putting in place a huge and disgraceful operation to conceal, if not destroy, the evidence to prevent the legal authorities ascertaining what really happened in the skies over Ustica.  The European Union and its Parliament have the institutional duty to protect the interests of the European citizens and not those of individual governments, NATO or the United States. The European citizens, including the 81 European families of the victims of Ustica, have the right to demand all our help in bringing justice to bear. And so it is our duty to ask for the States involved in the disaster to be put under pressure to say all they know. This is also of the greatest interest to us because this is the only way to prevent something similar happening again in European skies, and not only in European skies. Over the next five years, we are committed to creating a common area of freedom, security and justice. Ascertaining the truth on the Ustica disaster would be a major first step along this path.

 Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, we hope that the participants at the Tampere Summit will remember that migratory movements, however relentless, form the basis of the history of humanity and are, in the long-term, the premise for its collective salvation. We also hope that, on this basis, in trying to create a common area of freedom, security and justice, they are inspired by the principles of solidarity and inclusion and are not thinking about creating a European Community that is peaceful and wealthy on the inside but which is impenetrable to those pushing to get in from the outside on account of hunger, war or social difficulties. Internal peace and well-being cannot last long because the nearby countries cannot resign themselves to living with insecurity, need and chaos for long. We would be terrible hypocrites to take up the fight against discrimination, racism, and xenophobia as a founding principle of the European Community and then, in our normal procedure, to implement exclusion policies which heighten the fears of European citizens of being contaminated by people who are different to us. Just how they are different is a consideration we willingly leave to the racists. We would also like the area of freedom, security and justice to aim to increase the guarantees for everyone – be they citizens of the Union or people from other countries – and that it does not stop at declaring formal guarantees but also aims to put substantial guarantees into practice, such as those concerning work, social security, personal freedom, equality between men and women and many others which nowadays are being sacrificed on the altar of competition – global competition – so close to the heart of the Commission and its President. This neoliberalist strategy, a typical exclusion strategy, makes us sceptical even of the Tampere Summit, and we would be naïve to hope that our scepticism will be proved groundless.

 There is no doubt – and it is an obvious thing to say – that the conflicts in the Middle East are becoming more tragic by the day. I truly believe, and I am not just copying what others have said, that we must have the courage to admit that much of the responsibility for these unresolved conflicts lies with the international community and, most of all, with the military policy of President Bush and anyone who has stood up for that policy alongside President Bush. We cannot evade this problem, and I agree with the President-in-Office of the Council and with Commissioner Patten, that the Palestine-Israel question is central and essential to it. I also think we should abandon our conformist position and stop saying that the Palestinians do not recognise the State of Israel: they recognised it in 1988. It is not true that the Palestinian Authority does not want to negotiate: it is continually saying that it is prepared to negotiate. The one who is rejecting negotiation, the one who really is following a different policy is Ariel Sharon. I believe we should assess the matter objectively. There is no doubt that the Palestinian Authority bears responsibility for its own inability to stop terrorist acts, but I also think we should clearly assess to what extent Ariel Sharon’s policy has brought on the growth in terrorism. Mr Patten is right: it does not mean that terrorist acts in themselves, irrespective of the policies that are being implemented, should be condemned and suppressed. Let us stop telling ourselves that they are all birds of a feather. There are differences, and these differences are the ban on and the failure to implement any international rights for the Palestinians. Let us now think about that great plan, rather than a working paper, that the United States has prepared for the G8 Summit in June. In fact it is an arrogant, imperialist project and, although it provides for the development of democracy, democratic processes, preambles, aid and support, it does so without any discussion with anybody. We cannot export democracy – apart from the fact that we should begin to think about our own democracies – since democracy is a continuous process in which we too are inadequate, in which we too sometimes have gaps and differences. As it has been put forward, the Greater Middle East initiative is a plan that will certainly not help the growth of democracy. It will probably help some accomplice or subservient regimes, but it will not contribute to the reconstruction of Arab countries that do in fact need to free themselves from oppressive regimes and really need democracy. Not with arrogance and imperialism, however, please! I think the European Union’s decision to opt for the long term and not to aim for immediate results by cutting the Gordian knot of old is the right one. We therefore need time to reflect and to build relationships. In this sense, the Parliamentary Assembly organised in Athens is important: we have seen the differences and the diversity of the Arab world as well, and not just its weaknesses. I should like to return for a moment to Ariel Sharon’s policy. In 1973, when Winston Churchill’s grandson asked him what was to become of the Palestinians, he answered that there was no need to worry: ‘We’ll make a pastrami sandwich of them.’ He would crush them in a sandwich. That is what he is doing by building the wall and preventing freedom of movement. Sheikh Yassin’s assassination was not the first: there have been 250 extrajudicial executions, and the first victim was Tabet Tabet, an Al Fatah pacifist who was working with Peace Now. Why, though, do we always have to keep repeating and reiterating these things? I sometimes get tired of repeating myself and feeling that everyone bears the same responsibility. There are various types of responsibility, and I think that, with this decision, Ariel Sharon did not just kill a leader, something that – for heaven’s sake – I as a woman regard as the utmost in evil, but his intention was in fact to transform a national conflict into a religious conflict. That is what is so terrible. Four days ago I was in the mountains of Kurdistan and saw demonstrations in Van for Sheikh Yassin. That is the risk we are running; that is what President Bush has done. Finally, I also agree with the proposals put forward by Mr Barón Crespo on Article 2 and the other items.

 I see that the results that have come out of this survey also confirm what I claimed: among them, the fact that whenever foreign citizens travel to Israel to get to Palestine – because the Palestinians do not have any borders that they monitor – they are constantly subject to this procedure, and we ourselves have experienced obstacles to movement. There is another issue, over and above our freedom of movement, that I believe the Council must take into consideration, that is to say Palestinian sovereignty. In the current situation, not only can Palestinians no longer receive voluntary workers, officials or citizens but, in effect, they are also prisoners – partly due to what is currently happening with the Wall – within Palestine. Therefore, the Oslo agreement, which instead provides for autonomous Palestinian areas, is being rendered totally ineffective by Israel when the latter restricts the movement of foreign citizens too. I therefore believe that the Council should consider this aspect too and, above all, take specific action to stop Israel preventing freedom of movement, partly because, as things are, we can also respond in kind. If we have problems entering Israel, then perhaps Israeli citizens could also have problems entering Europe.

 Mr President, I would have liked to have said what Mr Menéndez del Valle said in his analysis but will say something else. Sister Dominique runs the Casa di Nostra Signora dei Dolori in Abu Dis, a village near Jerusalem, cut in two by the segregation and annexation wall, as it is known by Palestinians and peaceful Israelis, or by a security fence, as it is called by the Israeli authorities. This is Sister Dominique’s message: ‘On 11 January the construction of the new separation wall, nine metres high, was begun. It replaces another much lower wall built in August 2002 which people could climb over when they were no longer permitted to go to Jerusalem. Thousands of people have climbed over that first wall: children, students, mothers, old people; many have fallen, one person even died. Two months ago we had to call an ambulance for a 65 year-old man who fell and banged his head. The ambulance arrived much later. On the road the army searched the ambulance, made the injured man’s wife get out and on arrival at the hospital it was too late for him. The things that happen around this wall are intolerable. For months hundreds of people have passed through our property every day to avoid military controls because they do not have the required permits. People round about us live in fear of being arrested, beaten and humiliated, as too often happens. There is constant tension and living conditions are becoming increasingly miserable. Faced with general apathy we feel isolated and helpless. We want to speak out on behalf of those people without a voice who every day, for the last two years, have struggled to reach their place of work and their schools or die through lack of medical treatment. In attempting to carry out our mission, we have also encountered difficulties with soldiers when we have taken people in because the ambulance was forbidden to pass. The same problem arises when somebody dies: the cemetery is on the other side of the wall. Even the shops are on the other side. Many of our patients are alone, their families are no longer able to visit them. We do not know what will happen when the wall is finished. The majority of our old people and employees come from the West Bank. Only three of our eighteen employees have a Jerusalem identity card; for two years they have had to climb over the wall and change their route in order to avoid the checkpoints because, even with a pass, the soldiers would make them turn back. This nine metre high wall will make it necessary for us to sack most of our staff and refuse to accept old people from the West Bank, in other words those who are the poorest. We are worried and more isolated than before as a result of the wall and because the surrounding area has been turned into a military zone. Help us!’ Those are the words of Sister Dominique, but far worse, in fact, is the situation of the inhabitants of Qalqilya who are prevented by the wall even from seeing the sunrise. The sole exit from the city has an iron gate, for 50 000 people, which the Israeli army opens and closes as it pleases. At 5 p.m. it is locked and nobody can enter or leave the city after that time. In addition, what is to be said about the inhabitants of Budrus who have attempted, together with many Israeli pacifists, to use non-violent means to oppose the uprooting of their trees and the destruction of their homes? They have been brutally beaten by soldiers; one Israeli boy is still in hospital. The wall and the barriers under construction are, in fact, forcing the Palestinians to live in ghettoes. It is for security, says Sharon, it is to prevent terrorist activities, not wanting to understand that security cannot be based on the construction of a wall and camps, but on the Palestinians having the possibility of living in freedom in their State in coexistence with the State of Israel. The wall is not merely a prison: it amounts yet again to the confiscation of land, yet again it amounts to annexation. It does not follow the 1967 borders but instead penetrates into and divides Palestinian territory. Meanwhile, the propaganda to have the wall accepted has intensified. Concerned at the negative reaction of the international community, the Israeli authorities are attempting to make the wall appear less monstrous. The proposal published in the Israeli daily newspaper Maariv
, made by the Minister for Foreign Affairs’ team responsible for public relations, stating that, ‘If the wall were painted in bright colours it would be more aesthetic reducing the damage to public relations’ is unfortunately not a joke. Parliament has condemned the construction of the wall calling for building to be halted. Walls, as we saw with the Berlin Wall, destroy freedom. The UN General Assembly has voted for the International Court of Justice in The Hague to deliver an opinion on its legitimacy. The President of the European Council of Ministers has stated, most inopportunely, that he considers the referral of the matter to the International Court of Justice ill-timed. Why is it, where the Israeli authorities are concerned, that international law and human rights violations must always be put to one side in the name of negotiations that do not exist, and the Quartet, instead of applying pressure in favour of the roadmap, allow time to pass by and the dying to continue in Palestine and Israel? This smacks of complicity because this wall is not about security; this wall amounts to territorial annexation, colonial conquest. The European Union cannot throw international law overboard. Let us take diplomatic action, relaunch the roadmap, do our utmost to prevent acts that can kill Israeli civilians, but let us also put economic and political pressure on Israel so that Sharon does not take unilateral action and returns to the negotiating table. As the President-in-Office of the Council said, the international community is heeding and giving its backing to the Geneva initiative, non-violent Palestinian resistance against military occupation, soldiers who refuse to carry out bombardments and be the instruments of repression in the occupied territories, the Palestinian and Israeli parents who have had their loved ones killed by the army, by Israeli settlers or by Palestinian assassins/suicide attackers and who reject the idea of vendetta. All those things prove that coexistence and security are possible whilst affirming the right of all to live in peace with dignity and justice.

Mr President, nine hundred jobs lost may be no more than a statistic, but it amounts to more for the lives of the human beings affected. The plant in Terni is at the very heart of the city’s fabric; 900 jobs: the lives of young and old workers. The steelworks in Terni are the city’s history and pride; they represent the memories of the air raids that took place in the Second World War. When the management of Thyssen Krupp announced the closure of the magnetic steel section, the whole city – as Mr Sacconi said – took to the streets with the workers. Terni is not an isolated operation: in Europe, Arcelor, Lucchini and Thyssen itself are currently preparing to reorganise production; plants in Belgium, the blast furnaces of Servola in Trieste have already received threats of closure, despite trade union action. Massive disinvestment and relocation of valuable products to non-European countries are in fact destroying European production capacity. Community funds, which have been considerable over recent decades, have been used to dismantle State controlled iron and steel works. The subsidies paid to private entrepreneurs such as Riva, Lucchini, Falk and other foreign groups have been used for the remodernisation of production capacity and the specialisation of the Italian iron and steel industry along profit-making lines. The European Social Fund and the structural funds have been used to finance restructuring and retraining programmes and have led to a younger workforce being employed in the sector – in Italy today the average age of iron and steel workers is 30 – but it is precisely this new generation of highly qualified young employees whose existence is under threat. In my view, the absence of a coordinated plan in the European Union to relaunch the iron and steel industry has contributed to individual plants in various countries – albeit at the cutting edge – being transferred elsewhere in order to fit in with the industrial plans of individual entrepreneurs. The Thyssen plant in Terni, which is currently suffering heavy losses in the magnetic steel sector to the benefit of the Russian company Duferco, is cutting back production and preparing to transfer operations to Mexico, Korea, China and India. There is no sign of innovation, new research or competitive challenge: the only thing visible is a dangerous move towards retrenchment which, if not stopped in time, will have repercussions for employment and social cohesion, not just in Italy but throughout Europe. Despite the drastic reduction of employment in the sector in Italy, which has fallen from 100 000 jobs in the 1980s to 40 000 today, the steel sector still has an excellent position in the market because it is the second European producer. In order to maintain that position, however, requires industrial choices to be made by the Italian Government – which do not appear to be forthcoming – and a clear commitment of intent at European level. Steel and electricity are economic indicators of absolute excellence in a country, a measure of economic development. It is therefore essential that the European Union introduce systems for tackling pollution and monitoring the environmental impact, which are priorities if the aims of the Kyoto protocol are to be pursued. On this basis a new steel industry can be launched. We must find solutions in the form of industrial policies geared to protecting quality products, environmental conditions and employment in the iron and steel sector. In this sense, in response to threats to employment and gradual social impoverishment, the Commission should give a commitment to review the rules governing the structural funds. Granting of those funds in future should be made conditional on a binding commitment being given to invest in a given location for at least ten years, subject to an explicit agreement that the subsidies will be reclaimed in the event that production is moved elsewhere. In my view, Directive 98/59 on protection in respect of collective dismissals should also be reviewed so as to consolidate the measures designed to protect employment by making provision not only for information procedures for workers’ representatives, but also requiring a commitment on the part of the social partners to open appropriate and binding negotiations with a view to preventing dismissals or the reorganisation of production to the detriment of employment. The jobs in the steelworks at Terni must be saved, as must the jobs in other Italian and European plants and for this reason I believe that a meeting is required between the governments of the Member States concerned, the social partners and, in this specific case, Thyssen Krupp, to draw up a new industrial plan to relaunch the magnetic and inox sectors at European level.

 We need to give strength and value to the UN and give strength and value to the European Union, strength that should derive from the ability to be a point of reference in terms of political, moral, ethical, economic and social practice. The UN and the European Union emerged from the ashes of the devastation of the Second World War. At the time, it was said ‘never again’, and so rejecting war and eradicating poverty should be the cornerstones of the European Union and the UN. Commissioner Patten is right that what we need is not just peace, but peace combined with justice. I am sorry to say, however, that peace and justice are not such key issues. The European Constitution talks about promoting peace but it does not accept that rejecting war and negotiating solutions to conflicts are fundamental. In recent years, the UN has been devalued, partly at least by the military policy of a fundamentalist president of a country that still practices the death penalty in many of its states and that rejects international organisations, not least the International Criminal Court. War has become legitimate again; militarism is permeating hearts and minds. I do not underestimate the important commitment made by Mr Laschet and all the members of the Committee on Foreign Affairs, Human Rights, Common Security and Defence Policy. Together with the message sent out by awarding the Sakharov prize to Kofi Annan, it is a clear message designed to restore value to the European Union and the United Nations and to once again give them a role. It is, however, essential that security for everyone, the reduction of poverty and the promotion of justice and peace are genuine practices and not just empty promises. The UN and the European Union, together with other countries, must re-establish trust and, above all, respect for international law.

Mr President, at Tel Aviv airport a document was handed over which seeks to prevent movement in the Palestinian occupied territories of the West Bank and the Gaza Strip. Those who want to go to the Palestinian Authority territories must obtain written authorisation and, without such, the Israeli authorities can – and I quote – ‘deport, arrest and prosecute those entering the autonomous areas’. This is, in my view, an extremely serious act and a breach of the sovereignty of the Palestinian Authority. The wall stops Palestinians from moving around: now it is the Israeli authorities that decide who Palestinians can meet or not; in other words, the jailers are granting authorisations to the prisoners. The same document was sent to European Union contractors and officials. I therefore call upon the President, the European Commission and the Council Presidency to intervene and to ask the Israeli authorities why they are restricting people’s movements in this way. I will pass on the document that has been received by various foreign citizens.

In fact, I am referring back to Mr Cushnahan’s and also to Mr Sandbæk’s questions. Among other things, I asked the Commission if it really does provide the Member States with sufficient legal and technical means to identify goods that are entering illegally. I would like to thank the Commissioner for his suggestion for the next question because it would be interesting to discover which countries, for example, instead of requiring observance of the agreements, are endeavouring to ensure that the agreements and the interests of the European citizens are not respected.

 Mr President, I would like to thank Mr Menéndez del Valle very much as well as all of the members of the committee, who worked together to draft this document, which is, indeed, the product of a European culture, but of a European culture that is, perhaps, the rinascimento
 and other things, certainly not the one referred to earlier. I have the impression that the sleep of reason, as Francisco de Goya said, produces monsters, and, sometimes, I also feel that these monsters, which are, in actual fact, the result of the dehumanisation of mankind, are among us. I sense in this House the inability to understand the suffering of others, the inability to understand that time is running out and that, whilst we have been discussing what solutions to adopt for months, for years, people are, in fact, still dying in Palestine and Israel. The inhumanity that I sense here is one that does not understand the daily suffering of living under military occupation, the injustice that children suffer. Of course, there is talk of the pain and suffering of Israeli children that are killed by human bombs but, for Heaven’s sake, we must stop this and start seeing things as they are. There are United Nations resolutions that are not enforced. Let us begin to think about these things and experience them, see the people, go to the places and understand. This is why I said that the sleep of reason produces monsters. I fully agree with the report, which is very important and quite clearly stresses its refusal of violence, but stresses just as clearly the right to live in peace, to build. Time is short and I believe that two initiatives are extremely important. Today, we have had Naomi Kazan and Jamal Zakut here; we are going to have Yossi Beilin and Yasser Abed Rabbo here. These are the courageous ones, the people that have the courage to say: let us build, let us work, let us plan; just as all those Israeli voices are courageous – and they are those that we should listen to – like the pilots that refuse to go and bomb. This is something of great importance. There is an extremely serious problem: the wall. Mr Poettering said this at the last Parliamentary sitting too: the wall is a disgrace. The wall is destructive, but, above all, it is an annexation of territory. One cannot annex territory and colonise and then want peace. There can only be peace where there is mutual respect. We are giving a strong signal with this report and I believe that we must continue in this direction.

 Actually, Mr President, I would rather not have spoken this morning; I would rather have kept silent, just like the Israeli women in black who have been silently saying ‘Stop the Israeli occupation’ ever since 1988. I have too much love and respect, however, for my group’s chairman, Mr Wurtz, who has asked me to speak, and for my colleagues, but, most of all, a symbolic gesture might not work here and so I will have to use words. I must say, Mr Solana, that I feel frustrated, embittered and, above all, highly indignant. Indignation is a political concept, not a state of mind, and I am indignant because, every day, I feel caught up in a spider’s web in which the law, justice, freedom and the truth suffocate and die every day: they perish in the Dance of Death performed by the Sharon government, Hamas and Islamic Jihad. On the one hand – and it is not trite or futile to repeat this – there is an army that is militarily occupying a country; on the other, there is international law, which is constantly being flouted and which we now repeat like a litany. International law should be obeyed, but not a single resolution is being obeyed. I have no hesitation in considering Hamas and Jihad to be enemies, even though, as I am non-violent, I have eliminated the concept of enemy. It is clearly criminal to send young people to kill themselves and others; those who do so are responsible for these deaths and I consider it a crime, but please let us also break out of this inertia, this diplomacy that causes more deaths every day and contributes to this crime. I feel responsible, together with you, all of you, for what is happening in that country, because it is not enough just to call for compliance with international law. Of course, it is a good thing to go there, and I, too, thank Mr Solana and I thank Mr Moratinos very much, although I have to say that, at the time of the Quartet, Marc Otte was, in fact, absent because of Ariel Sharon’s blackmail at the most sensitive moment when they were resuming talks on the Roadmap. We were not there at that moment, because we rightly recognised that Ariel Sharon had been legitimately elected. Yasser Arafat, too, was legitimately elected, and he cannot be accused of representing everything that is evil. He is not my leader – I am an autonomous, free-minded independent – but it must be admitted that Yasser Arafat has been a prisoner for the last three years, and that is no minor matter. Yasser Arafat has been a prisoner for the last three years and he certainly cannot be in military control of the Jenin area, where there are Israeli tanks, bulldozers and soldiers. He cannot. He can do what the government under Abu Mazen and now Abu Ala has been trying to do: to come to a political agreement with all the forces, including Hamas and Jihad, the moderate wing, let us say the wing that accepts peace or accepts a total cease-fire. Every time, however – it is not just a trivial thing to say: it really is true, and that is how it is – every time, some leaders get killed. This is of no small importance, and I am very grateful to Mr Poettering and I would not like him to feel embarrassed because the left likes him so much today or because I usually respond to problems in a cross-party way. I thought Mr Poettering’s speech was marvellous, to the point and perfect, even on the subject of the wall. Commissioner Monti, I think you should go and see the wall. As Mr Poettering said, the wall separates, destroys and kills freedom and the chance to communicate. That is not the state that people want to create for Palestinians and Israelis: we want a state in which Palestinians and Moslems communicate together. That wall is an obscenity, it is clear to everyone, I have seen it, I went to see it last Saturday. In Adudis, it cuts the whole village in half. An article in the Israeli newspaper, Haaretz
, by Gideon Levi, who is an amazing journalist, tells of how, in order to cross the road, children have to squeeze through the gaps in the concrete: their thin bodies get through but their schoolbags do not and they throw them over to the other side. It is an obscenity that must be stopped. Now, I am convinced that there are many things that can be done; I am also convinced that Parliament must take itself more seriously when it drafts and adopts resolutions. I am tired of writing resolutions and building bridges: the resolutions need to be enforced. We have been saying since time immemorial that we need to set up an arms embargo and that we need to verify the applicability of the association agreement; most importantly, we have decided on a high-level delegation (I have nearly finished) from Parliament. I believe we should do this; we should keep following the Roadmap, and there is a hope … I am sorry, Mr Cox; I am sorry, everyone; I have not written out my speech and so I have lost track of time, but I should like to say one more thing. There is a great hope in Palestine and in Israel: it is those thousands of Palestinians who endure every day and who do not agree with the bombs and the attacks, and those hundreds and thousands of Israelis who are fantastic, like the two pilots last week who were ordered to bomb Nablus and refused. They were over Nablus; the young men felt for the people and turned back; obviously they were suspended from duty. This is extremely important: it shows that a sense of humanity is growing, and we must make it grow within ourselves, in others and among Palestinians and Israelis. (Sustained applause)

Mr President, my colleagues have already made many of the points that I wanted to raise in an extremely clear and precise way, and so I will not repeat them. I would, therefore, just like to ask myself – and you – some questions. I wonder, firstly, whether the European Union’s efforts to pursue political dialogue and the participation of the quartet will be strengthened or weakened by the genuine reluctance on the part of the Commission to ensure that the protocol on origin rules and the territorial clause in the EU-Israel Association Agreement are enforced correctly. I am raising this point as I believe that it is fundamental. We have been debating this issue for years and there is no doubt that progress has been made, yet we are, once again, facing a blatant violation of this agreement. There are enormous obstacles to the peace process which, in my opinion, are due, firstly, to the policy of the Israeli Government, which is continuing with its settlements, following a policy of annexation and erecting walls. These obstacles are also, however, the result of the increasing violations of fundamental principles and the rules of international humanitarian law in Israel and Palestine. I believe that we should not give aid that allows agreements concluded not to be enforced. I would also like to consider the reasons why Israel is violating the agreement, Article 2 of which calls upon Israel, and us, to respect it. We are responsible for ensuring that, on the basis of the agreement, our relations are founded on the respect for human rights and not on the violation of international humanitarian law. I believe that a politically appropriate, measured response from the Union to Israel’s persistence in issuing certificates of origin for products from the settlements should ensure that no product can continue to be given preferential treatment as an import into the European Union. If we give due weight to the statements of the Commission regarding preferential treatment of products imported from the settlements, then we see that Israel’s practice of issuing certificates of origin for these products is considered by the Commission to be a violation of the agreement. Nevertheless, this practice still continues. The agreement – the Commission has said so too – is not being enforced resolutely. I would like this issue of relations and legality to be addressed, because we need to end the situation of ‘anything goes’ that exists in Palestine and Israel. Israel needs to learn to enforce the agreements that it signs.

 Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I hope that my report reflects the balance between the various viewpoints in this House, although the key point is of course the fact that trade is not the solution for development. I would like to thank everyone, Members and Secretariat staff alike, because there have been a great many amendments and we managed to achieve an agreed position in committee. We are on the eve of the Fifth World Trade Organisation Ministerial Conference, which is to be held in Cancún. In 1999, in the run up to Seattle, Commissioner Lamy, who will be negotiating on behalf of the 15 EU countries at Cancún, was given a specific mandate. However, the issues up for negotiation were different. I believe that the WTO now has enormous influence and that it has assumed too great a role, so much so that it almost seems to have become the new United Nations. In fact, this is just one of the reasons. I think that a new mandate is desirable, bearing in mind, not least, the objectives and commitments entered into by the European Union in different international forums. Furthermore, the Doha Round, which was called a development round, has not been followed up; in fact, the proportionality relationship between liberalisation and development has not been proven to be correct. Quite the opposite, in fact: indiscriminate liberalisation and deregulation in developing countries have, in practice, proved to be extremely damaging to development objectives. Even where liberalisation has led to an increase in GDP, the distribution of wealth within the countries concerned has very often deteriorated. For this reason the report calls for regional integration between developing countries, and a model of symmetrical market opening, so that the developed countries can dismantle their barriers to trade, including non-tariff barriers, giving the countries of the southern hemisphere the time they need to step up their production, make it more competitive, and expand their markets. I also think it is important to remember, inter alia
, how much we, the countries of the northern hemisphere, have benefited historically from protectionism on the way to our present level of development. Nevertheless, every now and again we are surprised by the fact that the Commission insists, for example, and despite the resolution adopted by this House on 3 July 2003, on embarking on negotiations on the Singapore Issues. I do not have time to list all those issues, but they include public procurement. I do not think it is appropriate to open negotiations on these issues. The reasons for this relate, on the one hand, to the competences and power of the WTO, and on the other hand to the problem that I have already mentioned, namely the developing countries' lack of negotiating capacity. Indeed, these same countries stress in their reports that they are not in a position to support further negotiations. I believe, in fact, that it is vital to tackle other issues and to give the special and differential treatment clause some real substance, by implementing a global system of guaranteed prices to support producers of commodities such as coffee and cotton. The issues that need to be dealt with in terms of development are achieving and promoting fair trade – something that is, in fact, being pioneered in civil society – and the provision of assistance to countries to enable them to diversify their production without creating enclaves in export sectors, by actually promoting the integration of those sectors with the rest of the economy. It is my belief that development objectives should, above all, be related to the well-being of the population. I therefore consider that the Declaration on the TRIPS Agreement, which states that the agreement may and should be interpreted so as to preserve the right of the Member States to protect public health, should be implemented without delay and without resorting to agreements stipulating procedures that are so restrictive and bureaucratic as to be unworkable. This aspect was covered thoroughly in Mr Lannoye's report, and in my own report, I, too, have, for example, stressed that it is important for essential goods such as water not to be left to market forces alone and that the European Union should pursue a policy of public funding not only for water distribution, but also to bring about the democratisation of water management as regards the management of springs, rivers and basins. Any discussion of development should include the issue of debt, which was not, in fact, covered in the Commission document, although I concede that it was not strictly relevant. Highly indebted countries have debt-servicing obligations that can siphon off as much as a quarter of the value of their exports. I believe that the EU should commit itself to cancelling developing countries' debt, whilst providing for mechanisms for monitoring how capital sums resulting from debt cancellation are invested, so as to ensure that the benefits are genuinely felt by the population at large. Another issue is the enactment of a code of conduct comprising ethical, social and environmental clauses intended for European undertakings that make direct investments. With regard to the negotiations to be held in Cancún, it must be pointed out that we need a democratic, transparent system within the WTO and sufficient negotiating capacity for all countries, which do not exist at present. These conditions are therefore virtually indispensable if we are to establish a level playing field. I believe that we have a long road ahead of us. We must act so as to correct the enormous disparities that exist, which means that we need not unrestrained trade but, rather, trade designed to meet the social and economic needs of all the people on this earth.

 Mr President, there is no doubt that the Roadmap is a hope to which we must cling without allowing our political judgment to be clouded or losing our clear vision of the incidents taking place daily in Palestine and Israel. There is no doubt that the European Union as a whole and the resolute, committed work of the special envoy, Mr Moratinos, have played a major part in drawing up the Roadmap and helping the Palestinian Authority to undertake the series of reforms laid down in the Roadmap, which – as we are quite aware – does not resolve all the issues but is certainly important. Egypt too has played an active role. It is essential, however, that the whole Quartet is involved and supports the talks. It would be too great a risk and, in any case, a mistake to leave management to the USA alone. At the same time, it is essential that we support the talks at all stages without recommitting the errors of the Oslo Agreement when, after the great handshakes, the two parties were left alone with very different power relations, with the result that violence and oppression prevailed instead of peace. We are all aware, I regret to say, of the complicity and subordination of some European leaders in the face of the dominance of the US administration and of the tendency shown by the Israeli Government not to value Europe, Russia and the UN as interlocutors, considering them – wrongly – to be biased towards the Palestinians: wrongly in that it is a question not of bias but of not renouncing the law and justice. In other words, the reality is that international law is not binding for some of these countries. In any case, if it were, if the law were being respected, the issue of Palestine and Israel would have been resolved a long time ago, at least when the PLO opted in 1988 at Algiers to coexist peacefully with the State of Israel and to have its own state in the territories occupied in 1977. The imbalance, symmetry and situation of Palestinians and Israelis, of occupied and occupiers, are not trivial considerations. Quite the opposite: it is essential to stress that it is the Israeli army which is occupying: it is not the Palestinian Authority which is building settlements and holding Palestinians prisoner. The utterly despicable terrorist acts against civilians are perpetrated by Palestinian extremists, not by an army duly equipped with weapons, although in saying this I am not absolving the Palestinian Authority of errors and weaknesses which have harmed the cause of a just peace. The Roadmap offering a possibility of peace for both peoples is, once again, a challenge and a source of hope, but if we genuinely want Palestinians and Israelis to live in peace and security, we do, of course, need to call upon the Palestinian Authority to make every endeavour to stop the terrorist acts – and Abu Mazen, with the support of President Arafat, is pursuing the path of dialogue with great determination to stop the violence and prevent a civil war – but we must also call very strongly upon Ariel Sharon to comply with the initial stages of the Roadmap and bring to an end the targeted assassinations which seem to be intended precisely to provoke terrorist reactions. Mr Sharon has said that three and a half million Palestinians cannot be ruled with military occupation. Then let him act upon his words, as Gedeon Levi, a Ha’aretz
 reporter says. Let him remove the checkpoints and stop the hunger and the demolition of houses, let the sick and nursing mothers have access to hospitals, let children no longer see their parents being beaten up or humiliated in the dead of night. This will lend impetus to the peace process. Then there is a monstrosity which Commissioner Patten mentioned too: the wall, the wall of separation, of apartheid, of annexing of territory. It is eight metres high and 364 kilometres long, protected by barbed wire and with electronic controls. The wall represents annexing of territory: 30 water wells seized, 16 Palestinian villages separated from cultivatable land. Ariel Sharon has given orders for construction work on the wall to carry on even during the night, and 374 kilometres are not enough for him – the banks of the Jordan are to be cut off by the wall too. We must exert pressure with the instruments we have to bring about the creation of two peoples and two states. We support Kofi Annan’s call, backed by the French Minister for Foreign Affairs, to send an international peacekeeping force to stop Palestinian and Israeli deaths. It is already long overdue.

 Mr President, too many people have died in this conflict, killed in a war of fratricide and poverty: out of three and a half million inhabitants two and a half have been dispersed, there are rapes, summary executions and enforced conscription of children to the army and military groups. This death and destruction weigh like lead weights on our consciences too. We cannot fail to feel responsible for the neglect, the indifference, the interests of our multinationals who are greedy for this large country’s resources, the colonial heritage, the misdeeds of the international and native communities which are, in reality, mixed, for neither is blameless. We must act. The peace agreements are in jeopardy, and the different parties fighting are to blame for this in a number of ways, particularly where the various countries have failed to withdraw troops. There must be no more massacres like that which claimed hundreds of victims on 3 April 2003. Kofi Annan has reminded us that the perpetrators of criminal acts must answer for their actions to the international community. That is why we too must step up our efforts to create an international criminal court to try the perpetrators of such crimes. In my opinion, it is necessary to support and give effect to the calls of various social groupings and movements for MONUC to be given more power and a higher profile. It must fulfil its mandate by taking practical action, implementing peacekeeping measures in the territory, to ensure that there are no more massacres and to guarantee the security of the people, so that the situation in Ituri, where MONUC did nothing and was unable to act although informed of the potential danger of a massacre, is not repeated. I believe we need the boldness and transparency of a common policy which denies support to regimes which promote war and investigates the allegations made in the UN report against multinational and European firms which are unlawfully exploiting the Congo’s wealth. The report records both unlawful funding of the militia and unlawful exploitation of gold, diamonds, oil and coltan. It is no coincidence that so much gold, more than the country’s mining capacity, is exported from Uganda, as are so many diamonds, which are not mined in Uganda at all. I genuinely believe we need to act as quickly as possible to bring peace and development in Uganda: the people need it. We must therefore launch a policy which is genuinely rigorous and transparent.

 Mr President, considering the suffering, the sacrifices and the dignity of the Vietnamese people in their fight for sovereignty and independence in the face of colonialism and US military intervention, which has destroyed life and nature for future generations with chemical and bacteriological weapons, they do not deserve a government which continues to oppress them and prevents freedom of expression and demonstration. Of course, progress has been made towards political, economic and democratic openness, including the trade agreement with the United States, the release of prisoners, the announcement of free elections and the Internet. However, this facade of renewal conceals the tragic reality. The 20 000 prisoners released were common criminals, while the political prisoners are still being detained. The Internet, as other Members have reiterated, is actually used for control purposes and satellite broadcasting is banned. Freedom of religion, confirmed formally for both Buddhists and Montagnard Christians, is actually far from being implemented: religious leaders have been imprisoned, there are house arrests and the faithful are under strong pressure to forsake their religion. People are not just being oppressed for their religious belief, however: the rule of law is being violated in the name of national security, a concept we are very familiar with by now. With our joint resolution, we call upon the European Union to continue its work and to pressurise the Vietnamese Government to pursue dialogue with the religious groups, to put an end to all oppression, to release prisoners and to allow the practical development of political and humanitarian organisations and NGOs.

 Mr President, we cannot shirk our responsibilities. The war against Iraq, based on the falsehood that weapons of mass destruction were present in the country, US militarisation and the principle of pre-emptive, indefinite war, has endangered the whole human race, forcing us to live in fear of terrorist crimes and the suffering they cause. We cannot fail to mention – it is our duty – that the USA’s imperalist policy is destroying not just life, land, history and culture but the entire system of world relations, the United Nations Pact and international law. We cannot just turn the page and pretend that nothing has happened. We must build and rebuild our relations with the USA, with the countries of the world, with due respect for human and civil rights, pursuing justice and rejecting double standards, as in the case of the Israeli occupation of Palestine. Saddam Hussein has vanished into thin air, and, I, together with the Iraqis, can only rejoice, but the situation is unstable and the occupying forces must be replaced by an Iraqi government which includes women and is coordinated by the United Nations. The European Union must do its part, promoting reconstruction and economic aid, the reestablishment of democracy and the access for Iraq to its own resources. France, Germany, Belgium, the Pope and the crowds of pacifists have given the European Union and Europe credibility in that part of the world. Let us therefore continue to pursue a path leading, as I said, to respect for rights and not oppression and occupation.

 I wonder when it will be our turn, when B52s or lethal cyber war weapons will attack our buildings, or maybe those in France, perhaps with the support of Great Britain and others. A paradox? No. We can expect even this from the fundamentalist culture of Bush’s council. I have seen an Iraqi baby’s lacerated head, lacerated by the weapons of those who call themselves liberators. Those bodies and images are no different from those of the Kurdish baby girl poisoned by Saddam’s chemical weapons, the little Palestinian boy slaughtered by the Israeli army, the little Israeli girl killed by a suicide bomber or the bodies of the Twin Towers victims. With this war, the masks have come off. The USA is not complying with international law: consider Kyoto, the International Criminal Court, the death penalty, star wars, the use of weapons of mass destruction. United States militarism is a danger to the international community; a policy of domination and death is a danse macabre
 between terrorism and this policy. However, it is also from the United States, from its people, that hope and an alternative are emerging: huge groups are saying ‘no’ to the war, ‘no’ to terrorism, ‘no’ to revenge, as they are all over the world. What can and should we do? How can we make the countries waging this war of aggression comply with the agreement ratified in the United Nations after the Second World War? Europe cannot simply say: we will take care of the reconstruction. Our efforts should be channelled into stopping an unlawful war. The present, Mr Simitis, is the past and also the future. This is why we must prevent Iraqi, British and American citizens dying. We say that the UN should be the organisation to act: and so let us convene the Security Council and the United Nations Assembly. Europe must be united, of course, but it must be united in saying ‘no’ and in ending this war. Rabiya, a young Iraqi girl, told me with great intensity: ‘You are killing our dreams too; you are killing our dream that we can free ourselves from Saddam Hussein’s dictatorship’.

 Mr President, there have now been too many years of systematic violation of human rights by the military regime in Burma – the Parliament should be active but it is non-existent – although there have, without a doubt, been improvements in the sectors of political and social life, and progress has been made in the area of individual freedoms, the most important element of which is the release of a remarkable woman who is leading democratic, non-violent resistance with determination and dignity – Aung San Suu Kyi. She is not yet free, however, and cannot move about freely. In reality, however, Burma still continues to be afflicted by the repression of ethnic minorities, rape and violence against women. The elimination of political dissidents and summary executions have not stopped. Torture, detention and forced labour are common practice. Despite the government’s denials, I believe that children are still forced to join the army 
and also, I regret to say, the rebel military forces. There are thousands of people suffering who we do not hear about from the media as we did, I am glad to say, in the case of the 13 years of house arrests imposed on the Nobel Peace Prize-winner. Consider, for example, the tragic child-soldier system. ‘It is a good idea to conscript children because they do the same job as adults but they are difficult for the enemy army to see’, one official had the courage to say. Forced labour is still common practice: recent Amnesty International surveys have shown that approximately 90% of the population of the State of Shan 
are subject to forced labour. These people have no choice: either forced labour or prison. Their work, for which they are not paid, consists of building military infrastructure, roads, buildings and military camps and even performing military duties. They work without a break from morning until night, with no food except a small quantity of toasted rice. Despite the fact that the Burmese penal code has banned forced labour, the situation has not changed. It has not changed despite the presence of the International Labour Organisation. Even the recent endeavours of the Thai Government have been frustrated by the categorical opposition of the Burmese authorities, which have even refused to give members of the political opposition permission to leave the country in order to discuss its economic problems. Worst of all is the continued abuse of power by the Burmese army, the military intelligence services, the police and other security forces. I genuinely believe, as other Members have said too, that the European Union must both continue to use its influence to press for negotiations between the democratic groupings, the ethnic minorities and the State to resume as soon as possible, and put pressure on the Burmese authorities, continuing, that is, with the current trade policy on Burma and, if possible, taking even stronger measures to curb the scourge of forced labour, in particular. It must also undertake to pursue … (The President cut the speaker off)

 Mr President, there are too many resolutions which have not been acted upon, and sometimes we too, as Members of Parliament, are guilty of thinking we have resolved a problem just by producing a resolution. I, however, am a woman, and among my role models are women who, because they had the courage to speak out or the desire to laugh or love, were barbarously tortured and burned alive in the name of God by the cruelty of pious, religious Christians. Nonetheless, religious practices, cultures and traditions can be changed. I come from a country where the crime of honour continued to exist even after the war, a country which only recognised rape as a crime against the individual in the seventies, when the feminist movement was in its heyday. Today, we women are still the victims of discrimination in Europe, our sexuality is commoditised, but our right to exist has been won. However, the suffering and injustice suffered by women and people all over the world seem to scourge our bodies and rend our souls now as never before. Once again, in the name of a God who is presented as all-powerful and merciful, religions, traditions and cultures mutilate bodies, stone people to death, impose arranged marriages and mutilate the bodies of innocent children with infibulation. We must prevent the killing of Amina Lawal, a woman who has dared to love and is condemned to being stoned to death for having a child out of wedlock. We must prevent religion, when it abuses human rights, whether the victim is a man or a woman, being used as a law, even a law which is secondary to the laws of the State. The Federal Republic of Nigeria has ratified the international human rights conventions. These conventions must have more than just theoretical significance: they must be observed and enforced in practice. Nigeria has even adopted a Constitution which guarantees the right to freedom without torture or punishment. On a number of occasions, President Obasanjo has stated that he is opposed to the death penalty being applied on the basis of Sharia law, but he cannot keep up these double standards forever. It is true that the issues are complex, but now, the lives of many men and women are at stake – today, it is the life of Amina Lawal, yesterday, it was the life of Safiya Hussaini. Yet how many other women and how many men are lying in prison or are charged and hanged? The European Union – and we personally – must make a total commitment not just to preventing Amina Lawal’s death but to ensuring that the international agreements are genuinely ratified. We must therefore compel the Nigerian Government to act on its undertaking and provide all possible assistance, prevent Amina’s death and guarantee that a similar sentence is never pronounced again. I genuinely believe that it is extremely important for there not to be double standards. We must start from our basic principle, from the fact that it is essential for us too, here, to respect human rights – with regard to immigrants and many others – and so we must do everything possible to ensure that no more people die.

 Mr President, the political situation in Venezuela warrants the greatest possible interest and attention from the European Union. My group condemns the instigators of the coup
 of 11 April who irresponsibly attempted to overthrow the country’s democratic, legitimate constitutional institutions. Most of all, we condemn the Council of the European Union’s complicity with the instigators of the coup
 at the time. We have not yet forgotten that the Presidency of the Union immediately sent a message of support to the instigators of the coup
, a black day 
for European diplomacy. It is important to respect the Venezuelan Constitution, which was drawn up by a democratically elected assembly and equally democratically ratified by a huge majority by the Venezuelan citizens. Indeed, the anti-governmental action against the government instigated by the part of the opposition known as the Democratic Coordinator lies completely outside the framework of the Venezuelan Constitution and, moreover, only served the economic and commercial interests of forces outside Venezuela which had no hesitation in reducing the entire country to poverty in order to continue to enjoy privileges and pursue specific goals. This does not, of course, mean that we blindly support all the actions of the legitimate Venezuelan Government. We support the moderating action of the Mesa de negociaciones y acuerdos 
working in Venezuela and we support the mediating work of the Carter Foundation, based on respect for the will of the Venezuelan people, which has several times been expressed democratically. It is important to remember that President Chavez has, on a number of occasions, declared that he is willing to respect the provisions of the Venezuelan Constitution and to submit to public consultation half way through his mandate. Respecting the political experiment in Venezuela means respecting the dignity of a people that has decided to take its fate into its own hands. We too have a responsibility to further this process and to ensure that the complexity of the situation in Latin America, not least, does not become such as to constantly jeopardise the autonomy of its people. That is another reason why our group calls for the motion for a resolution we have drawn up together to be adopted without amendments. (Applause)

 Mr President, I am a critical person, and I am very sad to have become afflicted in this period with pessimism regarding the future of our world too. Over and above our high-sounding declarations of principle, human rights are being violated in far too many countries: Chechnya, China, the African countries at war, Israel, the USA with the death penalty and so on and so forth. The blame lies not just with those violating these rights but also with those who see what is happening but do not intervene and genuinely enforce international law. In this sense, governments are often indifferent towards the work of UNHCR and their recommendations go unheeded. Like many of you, I feel indignation when fundamental human rights – the right to life, freedom of thought and movement – are ridden roughshod over in countries professing to be democracies too, and, today, illiberal, death-dealing acts are being carried out in the name of the war against terrorism, although that is not to say that terrorism must not be combated, as in the case of the massacre in Mazar-I-Sharif. I would like a measure to be taken in March which would make Israel, for example, which is a signatory State, respect, if not the UN resolutions requiring an end to military occupation, at least the Geneva Convention. Collective punishments, the demolition of houses, schools, hospitals, factories and shops, the uprooting of trees, arbitrary arrests, torture, extrajudicial assassinations, vandalism and theft perpetrated by Israeli soldiers, which I personally witnessed in Ramallah, are tragic, daily occurrences in Palestine, like the attacks against civilians in Israel. Three hundred and fifty Palestinian children and 80 Israeli children have been killed in the last two years, innocent victims of our failure to act. We have the means to do so but we often use two different sets of checks and balances: it is our alliances, not our values, which carry most weight. Europe is founded on the principles of democracy and the rule of law. If we are not consistent, first and foremost in the context of European Union affairs, employing all the means available to us, including the suspension of the association agreements with countries which have blatantly violated human rights, how can we be credible as promoters of these rights within the United Nations? We need the provision of enough UNHCR financial and human resources to be able to act more effectively. At the March conference, we must take tangible decisions such as sending a peace-keeping force to protect the civilian population in the occupied territories and refusing to allow Israel to obstruct or even fire on humanitarian missions. The resolution on which we are going to vote outlines effective, valuable priorities and commitments – such as the operation of the International Criminal Court, human rights monitoring in Iran and the cooperation of the institutions with associations and NGOs from civil society – which will further education and respect in the field of human rights and democracy.

 Mr President, yesterday the Greek Presidency stated that the priority under its mandate is to put the motto ‘‘Our Europe’’ into effect, and share the future in a community of values. However, values should not just be described; justice, the fight against poverty and peace must be pursued in difficult circumstances. In reality, the more we talk about peace, the more war there is; there is talk of negotiations while troops are being prepared. When will this duplicity end? How much longer will bullets kill Palestinian children, suicide bombers kill Israeli citizens, Russian soldiers kill people in Chechnya and the USA kill wherever it thinks it has an interest, and so on? I shall not give any further examples, since the world is such a big and terrible place. Is this rhetoric or sentimentality? No. I am expressing political and moral outrage, a stern warning against creating a Europe which has a forked tongue, as an American Indian chief once said while his people were being wiped out and moved to reservations. One year on from the Bonn Agreement and clearly many positive steps have been taken. The Commission’s facts and Commissioner Patten’s outstanding analyses, which I shall not dwell on as he read them out very clearly, are impressive. We all know that in a situation where there is devastation such as this, there are no shortcuts to achieving common interests without destroying specific aspects. We need to develop civilian infrastructure, rebuild houses, roads, schools, hospitals, not allow returning refugees to die from starvation and cold and attack the cultivation or sale of opium but give the population an alternative. I have personally seen the progress made this year, especially in Kabul – schools reopened, girls studying journalism – but at the same time, I have seen and heard that key figures such as military leaders and the United States have allowed human rights failures, which are still apparent. I am not just referring to abuse and discrimination against women at work, in the streets, in the media and not just, moreover, in the Herat area – land of the infamous Khan – but all over the country; I am also referring to social discrimination, to favour-based politics and nepotism, applied to everyone, but especially – and the USA is primarily responsible for this – with regard to the supply of arms, aid and political support for military leaders who should be before the International Court. We need to help the central government, the Ministry of Social Affairs – the Minister for Equal Opportunities, Habiba Sarabi, has appealed to us all to increase aid and support for gender policies and women’s policies within the European Commission too – and enable democratic elections to take place in 2004: these are all essential things. Moreover, it is also essential, as Commissioner Patten said, to extend central power to the various areas of the country, above all separate military power from civilian power and encourage the Human Rights Commission, not just the Afghan one – Sima Samar is a courageous woman who bravely continues her work – but also UNAMA. I met UNAMA representatives in Kabul who could not travel round the country for fear not only of warlords, but also of marines, for fear of speaking out and exposing human rights violations, in which we were also complicit. We must therefore carry out investigations for UNAMA. The passage of time does not, however, help democratic forces: Commissioner Patten also said this, just as he said we are arriving late; perhaps we could have done more in 1980. Donor countries should pay greater heed to the government, but above all to women’s organisations which are saying loud and clear that the warlords’ power must be cut off and the country must be reconstructed on the basis of law and democracy, because there can be no democracy if there is torture or massacres such as the one at Mazar-i-Sharif. Europe must continue to do its part; we cannot take a different path: we must give continuity to our work and our commitment.

Mr President, there is no doubt that the EU-Lebanon Association Agreement goes beyond relations with the Lebanese Government and takes on an extraordinary importance within the network of relations based on dialogue and cooperation in the Mediterranean and the Middle East, especially at times like these when the threat of war looms so large and risks undermining the development of cooperation between our peoples and harming the still vulnerable Lebanese Government. There have been many years of war with Syria but also with Israel, with external interference and invasions, which have not yet been definitively settled; also a civil war which has devastated social and family relationships, though the International Community’s neglect has done damage too. Lebanon’s rebirth could lie in that strength which previously was its weakness: the intertwining of cultures and religions, rooted in the country but different from each other. The Lebanese Government should be acknowledged for having managed to maintain a balance between the parties and for wishing to rebuild a sovereign country in a difficult democratic process, because there are still clear violations of freedom of expression, human rights, social inequality and corruption. In particular, I am referring to the situation of the Palestinian refugees, who have been prohibited by law from having any opportunity to work, for healthcare or for travel and it is hypocritical of the Lebanese to assert that this is because the refugees have to return to Palestine. In this connection, when developing relations and projects with Lebanon, we have to persevere and find means to ensure compliance with the agreements and commitments which are made, even if the example of the EU-Israel Agreement and Israel’s blatant violation of Article 2, certainly do not provide a guarantee that this will be respected. I nevertheless consider it extremely important for this step to be taken, in the clear and certain knowledge that it is essential to help rebuild this country; but it is essential that this country is rebuilt on the clear basis of freedom of expression and human rights.

 Madam President, the destruction of their cultural heritage is an open wound which bleeds constantly 
for the Palestinians. Between 1948 and 1952, the Israeli Government destroyed 420 Palestinian villages, as documented by Israeli historians. Some of the Arab districts of Jaffa were destroyed. In 1967, after the occupation of East Jerusalem, the Moroccan quarter of the Old City was destroyed to make room for a large square in front of the Wailing Wall. Throughout these years of military occupation, permission was never granted for restoration of the historic parts of the various cities. After the Oslo agreement and the creation of the Palestinian Authority, a very enthusiastic start was made on restoring the Old Cities of Nablus, Bethlehem and Hebron. In the past two years, with the reoccupation of the autonomous territories, the destruction caused by the Israeli tanks and bombings has been huge. Sixty-six palaces built between the thirteenth and eighteenth centuries have been destroyed, including the caravanserai, the Turkish bath and the old soap factories. Today, it is the turn of the Old City 
of Hebron, where the houses are next to the Tomb of the Patriarchs: Mameluk and Ottoman houses and houses from the British Mandate. This is more than just a question of preserving old buildings however: the Old Cities are inhabited by women, men and children, like those in the refugee camps in Jenin and Rafah who have no roof over their heads. Moreover, their numbers have risen to over 15 000 in the past two years. The official justification given by the Israeli authorities in the military decree providing for the demolition of the houses in Hebron talks of security and military grounds. Nothing could be further from the truth. Ariel Sharon has clearly said that there is a need to build a link between the settlement of Qiriat Arba and the Tomb of the Patriarchs. This is annexing of territory, for the Qiriat Arba settlements are illegal. It is true that the decision was taken to destroy the Old City, the subject of our resolution today, after an armed attack by a Palestinian group killed nine people, army soldiers and armed guards from the settlements. It is true that, in some cases, the houses destroyed in the West Bank belong to families in which a son, brother or cousin has taken the tragic, horrific decision to kill himself and Israeli civilians, but over 2000 houses have been destroyed in the past two years! This does not give the Israelis a licence to violate international law and the Geneva Convention, which clearly bans collective punishment, the destruction of property and the killing of civilians. Over 2000 houses have been demolished in these past 2 years and 20 000 people have been wounded. I am sad to say that there have been many Israeli deaths too – over 600 now. Israel is an occupying country which is violating the obligation laid down by the fourth Geneva Convention to move its people out of the occupied territories – there are over 400 000 settlers now – and should be ensuring the well-being and providing for the needs of the Palestinian people, whereas 72% of Palestinians are unemployed and confined in the villages. The first illegal fact is the military occupation of the West Bank and the Gaza Strip, which has now been in effect since 1967. Israel can no longer be allowed to continue to violate all international legislation, inflicting pain and suffering not just on the Palestinians but on its own people too. We must send out a signal to the Palestinians to give them hope of justice and to enable them to prevent the growth of fundamentalism. We must send out a signal to the Israeli Government so that it knows that it cannot always act outside the law, playing on the threat of anti-Semitism and terrorism. Our only concern is for there not to be two sets of checks and balances: human rights and the right to life are equal for all people. Today’s resolution sets a limit: the demolition must stop. We must act alongside those Israelis who, together with the Palestinians, have appealed against the demolition of the homes in Hebron and are going to demonstrate tomorrow in Hebron, for the cultural heritage of Hebron and Palestine is part of the cultural heritage of mankind and must be preserved, not destroyed.

 Madam President, I believe we should always pay great attention to our behaviour and political actions towards the countries with which we have relations and agreements in matters of cooperation and aid. There are times when our certainties or our model of democracy disregard the historical and political context of European integration and new forms of an old colonialism can appear, creating mistrust and feelings of injured dignity, or even injured sovereignty. We know that democracy is measured not just on election day but on the basis of effective grass-roots participation, civil liberties, equal opportunities, justice and development. Having said that, I do not in the least intend to give up the widely – and internationally – shared view that human rights are universal, which is why no specific context can justify the death penalty, whether in Pakistan or in the United States. I took part in the election mission to Pakistan led by Mr Cushnahan, to whom we must all be grateful – I am, at least – for the rigorous and thorough nature of his work. I agree with the EU report and the criticisms it contains not so much about the day of the elections, which, as far as I could see, were carried out correctly – we were given a very good reception by the people and the electoral representatives, and, moreover, I am talking about Peshawar, an area where the Islamic religious party prevailed – but rather the entire electoral process, with its restrictions and the erroneous decision to allow only those with a degree to stand as candidates. I believe the transition from military domination to democratically elected political representation will be difficult: the path of democracy in Pakistan is difficult and, without a doubt, is hindered by the military. I also think it will be extremely difficult to eradicate corruption and poverty, which goes hand in hand with its defeat, and I say so because I myself come from a country that is not poor but where there is still, in actual fact, a lot of corruption. I believe we must make a major effort in the fields of cooperation and trade and carry out political analysis in the areas of development and education, and I also believe that the human rights of all people should be upheld, even those accused of terrorism. We must therefore call upon the Pakistan Government to comply with the international treaties.

 I have been talking to some of the Members, and they said: ‘We do not agree with Bush but, if we had to choose between Saddam Hussein and George Bush, we would choose George Bush’. I, however, believe that there is a middle way between killing and dying, which we must take. I am not making a philosophical statement: this must be our political strategy, a strategy of living. However, in reality, George Bush’s decision to use war as a deterrent 
takes us back to the Pax Romana
: they called it peace and turned it into a desert. After 1945, we Europeans said ‘No more war, ever’. This is the strategy we must pursue, a strategy of dignity, for our dignity is also diminished by dishonesty such as that we are currently displaying. Of course, Saddam Hussein must be made to change, but his people must change too. We must promote democracy in Iraq, we must ensure that the UN resolutions are complied with, but we also have to ensure compliance with the UN resolutions by Israel as well as by Saddam Hussein, and Israel has failed to comply with hundreds of declarations and resolutions. Commissioner Patten asked when death and suffering for Palestinians and Israelis will come to an end. Yes, when will it end? I believe it will not end until we stop producing statements like those made by the President-in-Office of the Council today. As long as we continue along this path, Palestinians and Israelis will endure death and suffering for, as everyone is aware, Ariel Sharon’s policy is a criminal policy which is destroying both his own and the Palestinian people. Yet it is not just the violence and cruelty which concern me, it is the political decision to colonise a country. Indeed, in recent days, while all our eyes have been fixed on the siege of the Muqata, 
Ariel Sharon has been appropriating land at Rafah and, 
at Kalandria, 
the airport has been reopened as an Israeli airport. What we are witnessing here is a colonial war. It is my genuine belief that, in the interests of peace, it is essential that we follow the example of the Israelis and Palestinians who are stating clearly that it is military occupation that is responsible for the situation. On no account can we continue as we have been doing. I am truly appalled and saddened, for we are all, myself included, responsible for what is happening in the Middle East and for the continuing deaths in the region. (Applause from the left)

 Mr President, I like to think and act to promote mediation and combating poverty and injustice as the means of resolving conflicts, not war and bombing, but I am not a saint: I am completely immersed in the complexity and contradiction of conflicts. I agree with Commissioner Patten: it is not enthusiasm that is needed – although a little would not go amiss – but solutions, and these solutions must not be the Danse macabre
 being performed by Mr Bush and Mr Sharon or Osama Bin Laden and Hamas
, who are destroying people, nature and human and social rights. The conflict between forces of good and evil is reminiscent of the Middle Ages, and it undermines the rule of law. The Taliban have been defeated but their ideology lives on: many of their practices, with which those in power today are not unfamiliar, remain. The refugees are returning home but they are given no support, schools are reopening but schoolgirls have been the victims of a bomb attack, cinemas are reopening but they are banned from showing Indian films because they contain women without veils, women are banned from singing on the radio or television, rape and violence are common occurrences, the lethal, lucrative opium trade continues, and, although reconstruction is taking place – and it is a slow process – Afghanistan is in danger of forfeiting its sovereignty to money and corruption. For this and many other reasons, our economic and social aid must be provided swiftly and effectively to allow the establishment of the structures and infrastructure of a rule of law and to empower that part of civil society – particularly women – which is completely devoted to securing freedom, justice, development and peace for all men and women. The situation in Afghanistan is tragic and we must continue to help the country in the knowledge that there is a universal need for sovereignty and that there must be an end to war in the region.

 Mr President, although the Israeli-Palestinian question was central to the debate at Valencia – it could not be otherwise, given the tragic situation – there is no doubt that progress was made in adopting an agenda developing dialogue and partnership. Moreover, I feel that the decision to establish a Euro-Mediterranean Parliamentary Assembly is not insignificant, and we must work towards this objective with great energy. I have expressed my opinion regarding the resolution of the conflict many times in the past and I am tired of saying the same things over and over again; moreover, I agree with much of what has been said here. I would therefore like to use my time today to read you some of the things said by Palestinian and Israeli women who came to Parliament together to call for a European peace-keeping intervention. They are women from The Jerusalem Link, Israeli and Palestinian women. They are voices preserving a glimmer of hope for the future, the voices of people who really are counting on us to act upon our resolutions. I do thank both Mr Piqué and Mr Solana – who is not here – and Commissioner Patten for both their words and gestures, but I feel that we must implement what we stated in our Parliamentary resolution. This is what the women said: ‘The deliberate killing of innocent civilians, whether Palestinian or Israeli, cannot be condoned. Prolonging the suffering of the Palestinian people, destroying infrastructures and civilian houses and keeping President Arafat segregated will serve only to exacerbate the suffering and insecurity of both peoples and will destroy any possibility of peace. The two peoples cannot enjoy peace and security unless the root cause of this conflict, the true enemy of peace – military occupation – is eliminated. The two peoples are currently trapped in a climate of fear and of obsession with retaliation. We women refuse to be paralysed or divided by these fears. We cannot turn a blind eye to the policies and practices conceived with the aim of humiliating and oppressing the Palestinians and forcing them to submit to the strategic programme of expropriation, settlements and colonisation that Israel has been pursuing throughout 34 years of occupation. We cannot turn a blind eye to the fact that non-violent attempts by Palestinian movements to oppose the denial of their fundamental human rights have, in the past, always been met with violence and repressive measures from Israel and with silence on the part of the international community. If peace and security are to be achieved, we must put an end to the continued denial of the right of the Palestinian people to self-determination and do so in the context of fair, global negotiations. To this end, we call upon the international powers to provide an international presence in the Middle East to protect the civilian people. To this end, we call for the UN resolutions to be implemented. The rule of law, reciprocal recognition and reciprocal respect for individual and collective rights will pave the way to achieving peace.’ This is what those women said, and I feel that we cannot block our ears to these voices which are the voices of Israeli and Palestinian women but also of Palestinian and Israeli men uniting to say ‘That is enough! Stop the military occupation!’ Now we must turn words into tangible actions. The presence today of the European Union, which I hope will have been able to meet with President Arafat, is important, but we must make absolutely sure that Israel understands that we cannot allow it, in its unmitigated defence of its existence, its unmitigated defence against any potential threat to the Jewish people, to continue along its current path. We must use the instruments available to us too. We cannot be racist and suspend the agreement with Zimbabwe while treating Israel indulgently all the time. We must lose no time in taking action, for peace will benefit everybody.

 Mr President, I wept in front of the Israeli soldier who was preventing us attending to a wounded Palestinian. I wept for Ahmed who was lying on the ground, gesturing to us to come and help him. I wept – I have to say – for my powerlessness, our powerlessness. I wept for the Israeli soldier who had lost his humanity. I told him: ‘I am not crying because I am afraid of your machine gun: I am crying for you who are young. I am crying for Hetty Hillesum who, even in the concentration camp where she was interned, wanted to be the thinking heart of the barracks. I am crying because you are stopping me helping a dying man who – as you know – was not firing. I am crying because I saw you throw to the ground Palestinian policemen who had not fired on you and I saw you force them to kneel with their hands up against a wall. You forced them to strip naked and then you blindfolded them and tied their hands. They had all come out of their building – the front door had been knocked down by force – with their hands in the air. With them was an old man whom I have seen year after year in Ramallah. We would always greet one another. ‘Kiffech
’ he would say to me. ‘Mapsuta
’ I would reply. I am crying because, while the tank was firing on the building you forced us to evacuate – men, women and children – a young man was asking us for bread and cigarettes from the window of another house. I am crying because Mohammed Iska’fi, a doctor who had been wounded several times, did not hesitate to help a wounded Israeli soldier. And yet we have been stopped by tanks and by your machine gun. The wounded Israeli has been taken away; Ahmed is still lying in the street: you tore him away from us as soon as we had managed to lie him down on a makeshift stretcher. Are these normal scenes of war? Is there an unfortunate need for military intervention to protect the Israeli State against the wave of suicide bombers threatening to destroy it forever? 
I believe, together with many Israelis with whom we have been working for many years for a fair peace that recognises the right of both sides to their own state, that the only way to save the Israeli State is to end the Israeli military occupation. The spread of the settlements, the seizing of land, the curfews, the Palestinians imprisoned in their own villages, the summary executions, the ambulances prevented from reaching their destinations, the women giving birth at check points, the destruction of the Palestinian Authority: these are not mistakes or accidents. They are clear political policies dictated explicitly by Ariel Sharon, who, together with the parties of his coalition government, is demanding the transfer, in other words the deportation, of the Palestinian people, and not just the people of the occupied territories but the Arab citizens in Israel as well. The reoccupation of land and the destruction are evidence of the Israeli Government’s intention to annex the occupied territories. The policy of using suicide bombers, which, I am sad to say, is tragically no longer limited to Hamas
 or Jihad
 – organisations which, as a woman, I consider not just to be universally destructive but also to injure my rights too – must be stopped. There is neither moral nor political justification for these acts. I understand the Israelis’ fear, but I take courage from the organisation of Israeli and Palestinian relatives of victims who are saying, together: ‘Military occupation kills all people’. I take courage from a Palestinian, Jamal Zakout, who bears the scars of torture on his body, who says: ‘I am totally against attacks on civilians in Israel. Even though civilians are being killed by 
bombing, it is wrong to take the line ‘an eye for a eye, a tooth for a tooth’, it is wrong to say that because our own children and young people are dying every day theirs should die too. We must not lose our humanity. The future of the Palestinian people must not be shaped by the culture of death and revenge.’ The tragedy is two-fold. I wish we were all there, together with those Palestinians and those Israelis who continue to believe that the best form of security for all peoples, for all people, lies in the mutual acknowledgement of the right to exist and live in one’s own land in democracy and freedom. Shulamit Aloni, an Israeli woman, declares, every day: ‘I fought in the Hagannah
 to establish a Jewish state in Palestine and I find we have a colonialist state. I do not support this, I am ashamed of this army, of our governments who are destroying lives and all our human values in the name of security. I apologise to my group for using the common time available to us for such a personal testimony, although it is full of political relevance. We call upon the European Union to take up a firm, clear position in line with international law and the protection of human rights. It must use all the means available to it to compel the Israeli Government to withdraw from the occupied territories. It must recognise the State of Palestine with the 1967 borders. It must call for the immediate deployment of an international force. It must suspend the Association Agreement with Israel for Israel has patently violated Article 2; there is no need for further analysis. Peace is vital for the Palestinians, for the Israelis, for the entire region and for us too. I am not taking sides. I am for peace, we are for peace; there must be no victory on either side. But it needs to be established where the responsibilities lie and we must shoulder our responsibilities fully, so that we can all declare together that we want the reign of death, pain and suffering in Palestine and Israel to come to an end.

 Mr President, I request that the first clause – “calls on Israel to comply with” – be replaced with the clause “calls on the two sides to comply with international conventions”, and that, after the words “arrested and imprisoned”, the words “by Israel” be inserted.

 I too nurture some small hope. In actual fact, there seems to be greater awareness within Parliament of the tragedy taking place and also of where responsibility lies for this situation, not least our own responsibility. As Mr Solana has said on a number of occasions: we have wasted many opportunities. I fear we will waste others too, but I do feel it is important that we have gained this awareness. I find Mr Bush’s support of Ariel Sharon’s policy 
truly irresponsible, opportunist and inhumane, for it is not that the two sides lack confidence in each other: this is a specific policy, a specific decision – Ariel Sharon has made this explicitly clear in his speeches in the Knesset – not to allow a Palestinian State to exist, apart from ‘Bantustan’ territories, and not to give back the Occupied Territories. I do not understand why we do not realise that this is his policy and take appropriate action. At the same time, some responsibility certainly lies with Yasser Arafat, and it is an appalling tragedy for both Palestinians and Israelis that terrorist acts are taking place. However, my hope lies in Commissioner Patten’s words, in Mr Solana’s words, in actions and signs, and I would like to tell you of the great hope that I have in Israeli society. On Saturday, together with 300 Israelis – young people, coloured people, young lads who have refused to serve in the Occupied Territories, women, university professors – we crossed the Kalandia checkpoint, running serious risks for the Israelis who crossed it were told they were not allowed to enter the Occupied Territories. Three hundred of us crossed the Kalandia checkpoint to go to meet Yasser Arafat. The young Israelis said: ‘We want peace. We are the other Israel’. And Mr Arafat embraced them. However, the most important part was in the afternoon when we met the Palestinians and Palestinian organisations, and they too displayed their desire for peace. I therefore feel that it is imperative that we believe in these organisations and act to support them. I too, like Mr Cohn-Bendit, want to issue a challenge. If Mr Arafat leaves the territories, there is a danger that we will not be able to get him back in again. It is important that we work to support this operation, to bring Abu Ala and Avraham Burg here. International protection is vital for the Palestinian people; moreover – and here I agree with Mr Sakellariou – it is vital that we take practical action, even suspending the association agreement, for Israel must respect human rights.

 ‘I keep on seeing dead bodies: our country is a cemetery. We keep on resisting to free ourselves from terrorism and the war lords, and also from the USA, which created Osama Bin Laden and the Taliban and which, in order to fight and kill them, also bomb us.’ Fatima was talking to me on the telephone from Kabul: she is not a refugee but a RAWA leader. She says the streets in Kabul are once again crowded and the markets are full but there is no money and widows still live on charity and children scavenge on rubbish heaps. Everyone is still afraid. A few women have removed or raised their burka
, some men have had a shave, music has started to be played again, but there is fear of punishment and vendettas. That is why, said Fatima – and I agree with her – there should be a United Nations force there, without Russians, Americans or the British but with contingents from other countries: a multi-ethnic and multi-religious force working at disarming the military groups. Everybody is talking about the rights of Afghan women. That is excellent, provided women are not used yet again to justify acts of war. For years, Afghan and also European women have been denouncing the oppression and violence of the Taliban regime to deaf ears in the West. The war is not over; we cannot pretend it is and talk just of the future and reconstruction. Important steps have been taken for women to be included in the formation of the government, but that is not enough and the process is not finished. We must support those democratic women who have a secular view of the Constitution and who rise above ethnic and tribal divisions, but without denying their own identities. Many of us have met them; together – as other Members have mentioned – we have drawn up demands, but we have also put our own responsibilities on the table. The mines that maim were produced in western factories; the cluster bombs, dropped in their thousands in recent days and lying unexploded, are products of our factories; ours are the perverse patents allowing mines to be designed in the shape of butterflies or dolls; ours are the pretty yellow cluster bombs, the same colour as the packets of food dropped from aircraft. A shared road links us to the Afghan women, the road to freedom and justice for everyone, men and women. The resolution we are voting for today and the Fraisse amendment must not remain lifeless words on paper, but must be given practical effect.

 Madam President, I am becoming more and more inclined just to stand back and watch us and watch you in silence. I am tired, so tired of these repeated debates where it is so difficult to make progress: it would, however, be a silence in which you could hear the muffled voices of those who have been killed, who are calling for peace and justice, as Izzat Ghazzawi and Nurit Peled said this morning; it would be a silence which tells the consciences of all men and women that there can only be peace in Palestine and Israel if the Palestinian people is allowed to exercise the right to live in its own State, existing alongside the State of Israel, in mutual security. We must make this peace possible and not just by providing economic aid. We see it every day. What we build and our citizens pay for is destroyed by shells and bulldozers: from the airport to the port; even the anti-terrorism laboratory was destroyed the day before yesterday. I support the positions of Commissioner Patten and the Minister, but there can be no economic development if there is no release from Israeli military occupation. Europe is resolutely taking this line. A decision must be taken, even a unilateral decision, to establish international protection for the civilian population. There is no equality between occupied and occupier. We must take a balanced approach but not be afraid to make political choices. For peace to be achieved we need clear measures, for our benefit and for the benefit of both Israelis and Palestinians.

 Mr President, international trade is fundamental in our system and, in the opinion of those who advocate a different type of globalisation, including myself, international trade must be based on fair, equitable trading bringing development and wealth to the greatest number of people possible. Regrettably, the trade negotiations held under the auspices of GATT and the WTO did not serve to create fair international rules: quite the opposite, they left entire communities with no defence against the greed of multinationals. It therefore follows that these institutions are suffering an unprecedented crisis of legitimacy in respect of vast sections of communities, and are in vital need of thorough reform. The Désir report addresses clearly the limitations and dysfunctional areas of international trade, of unequal participation, and the lack of transparency and democracy and the ensuing consequences, and proposes reforms to remedy these shortcomings. We support the report and will vote for the motion, but we feel that this must only be the start of a process of change. The Commission and the Council must refuse to be influenced by pressure from the rest of the world.

 Mr President, I congratulate Mr Titley on his work and acknowledge his endeavours to include the point of view of civil society on arms exports. I would, however, mention certain negative points: firstly, light weapons. The UN Conference in July was a failure: in my opinion, the EU should commit itself resolutely once more to enforcing a reduction. As regards transparency, I feel that this is still too superficial and that Parliamentary scrutiny should be obligatory for arms exports. Then there is no reference to the OCCAT Agreement which actually protects industrial cooperation and is the basis for laws such as Italy’s which make it possible to export arms without infringing human rights rules. Then there is an arms exports control policy which must be in line with European common foreign policy. In short, I consider the Titley report to be important, but I feel – this is my point of view and is not a criticism of the Titley report – that the European Union should, in these tragic times, set itself the target of disarmament, not rearmament.

 Mr President, there is no cause, not even a just cause, which can justify the killing of innocent civilians. Terror does not pave the way for justice: it is the shortest road to hell. We condemn and deplore this appalling crime; we utterly condemn those who planned and perpetrated it. Our empathy with the suffering victims, with the pain of their families and the pain of the entire American people at difficult times such as this is no less than the expression of our total commitment to preserving the unique nature of the human race. These are not my words but some of the things Palestinian intellectuals, politicians and ministers such as Mr Yaser Abed Rabbo, Mrs Hanan Ashrawi and Mr Mahmoud Darwish have said. They are powerful statements, and they give us hope for they come from people who live and suffer under the Israeli military occupation. At times like these, we must all – people, States and institutions – act with the utmost responsibility and determination to remove terrorism from the face of the earth and put a stop to the globalisation of poverty, injustice and war for ever. ‘Words must replace arms’ as Mr Solana said. Therefore, no words must be allowed to provoke hatred or promote the ‘dead or alive’ cowboy culture: as the women against war say, between killing and death there lies a third way, which is life. No one must be exempt from training in love of peace and respect for the law, especially Heads of State. Today, a glimmer of hope for the future has come from Palestine and Israel with the announcement of a truce. It is a faint chance, I know, but it is vital that we do not let it go. The European Union has contributed to the possibility of dialogue being resumed. The Union’s political role must grow and, if and as this role grows, the Union must uphold the law with increasing determination. Just as we told Mr Arafat that he must be resolute in controlling terrorism, so we must make it quite clear to Mr Sharon that he cannot continue to get away with seizing Palestinian land, building settlements, killing and besieging Palestinians in villages or, as he did yesterday morning, destroying the Gaza port which is still under construction and funded by the countries of the European Union. We must take tangible action, reassuring the Palestinians that they will have a safe State to live in and assuring Israel that nobody is questioning its existence, that it is its colonialist settlement policy, not its existence, which is in question. Yesterday, in the Lebanon, I and an Italian delegation met President Lahoud. He stated quite clearly that he rejected terrorism, but he stressed emphatically that resolution of the Palestinian issue and development of political and economic cooperation with Europe and the Arab world are essential. We must believe in our own ability to bring peace and respect for the law.

 Madam President, I would have preferred not to speak this morning because, in actual fact, words do more damage than the Palestinian stones. I have had enough of words which are not matched by action and I am starting to doubt the power and effectiveness of Parliament and our institutions. Sometimes, I feel like the little girl in the story “The Emperor’s New Clothes”. We all know exactly what is going on. Mr Sharon speaks and acts clearly, and he says when he speaks in parliament that his intention is to bomb and kill, targeting, in particular, the Palestinian leaders, and to raise houses to the ground, not just in order to destroy the houses but as part of a clear plan. When I was in Palestine and Israel between 23 July and 22 August, I saw houses raised to the ground in the settlement areas to gain more territory for Israel; I witnessed the taking of Orient House
 and saw the Israeli flag hoisted immediately – a totally colonialist gesture. Therefore, Mr Sharon is going ahead with his plan, which is to restore only 42% of the territories to the Palestinians, who are forced to live in bantustans
, without a State or borders. He is making himself plain. Why do we not believe the things that Mr Sharon is saying explicitly? Why are occupiers and occupied placed on the same level? Like the President-in-Office of the Council, I am appalled and horrified by this situation, but I am also, on occasion, appalled and outraged at the way we describe the facts; of course, I condemn the throwing of bombs at civilians in Tel Aviv as an appalling, criminal act, but I feel that it must be said that the root of the matter is the need to put an end to the Israeli military occupation. I have met Mr Arafat several times – the last time together with French and American delegations – and he said to us: “We are not asking for much. We are asking for international law to be respected. This is our request and I have accepted everything: the G8, Sharm-el-Sheik and Mitchell.” The Mitchell plan was not rejected by Mr Arafat. It was rejected by Mr Sharon because the Mitchell plan stipulated the end of the settlements and new settlements are still being established today. Behind the fighting and violence, there is, in actual fact, a plan being executed: more destruction of houses and more settlements. This is a fundamental barrier to the possibility of peace. Together with Mr Hanan Ashrawi, Mr Yaser Abed Rabbo, Mr Yossi Beilin and Mrs Galia Golan, I signed the document presented at Ramallah: they demand peace, a fair peace. Just as those courageous Israelis who are defending the rights of all and who, together with me and many others, have been sleeping in the Palestinian houses bombed at Beit Jala demand it. Without a doubt, Europe must act. I would like to thank Commissioner Patten for the things he has said and I support Mr Galeote Quecedo’s proposal to reinforce our political presence in the field. I consider it absolutely essential for international observers to be sent but, once again, it is Israel who has refused to cooperate. Why do we not say so openly? Why do we not make the situation plain? Dialogue is essential for peace but respect for the law and for human rights are just as essential and cannot be treated as separate issues.

 ‘Hand in hand for peace’: that was the theme of the Adep demonstration scheduled to take place on 1 September in Ankara. In actual fact, the demonstrators were unable to hold hands because the police prevented any demonstrating taking place: they entered the headquarters of Adep, which is a democratic party, and arrested hundreds and hundreds of people, going so far as to shut them in the stadium. As we know, stadiums have been the scene of appalling, tragic incidents. I therefore call upon the President to make representations to the Turkish government to ensure that the freedom of movement and speech and the freedom to demonstrate can be exercised by the Kurds and Turks, who simply wanted to be able to march together for peace, and to ensure that the people detained in the stadiums and Turkish prisons are released immediately.

 Madam President, I would like to thank Commissioner Patten and the President-in-Office of the Council, Mrs Lindh, for their speeches. Suffering and tragedy will continue to mark the days and nights in Palestine if Israel and the wider international community do not take action to restore international and human rights. Yesterday was another day of tragedy: more than 200 people, including a French journalist, were wounded at the check points, although the Palestinians had not opened fire; the evening claimed another victim, an Israeli settlement; over 500 Palestinians were killed, 23 000 wounded and hundreds maimed for life; bombings, the houses of the poor demolished by bombs, thousands of trees – the livelihood of the peasant farmers – uprooted, roads blocked, despairing men and women, prisoners in their own villages, going hungry and Palestinian leaders considered to be military targets executed. Pacifists from the Israeli movement, Peace Now, and I myself wept at the murder of Dr Tabet Tabet, an old friend; schools closed, land confiscated to make room for fresh settlements and further suffering: 80 Israelis, including children and adolescents, killed. We must stop the cycle of violence, for every death, whether Palestinian or Israeli, reduces our humanity. I understand the despair, the rage, the humiliation, the collective punishments, the retaliation, the need of the Palestinians forced to live under military occupation for 30 years for freedom; I understand the historical fear of the Israeli people, the persecutions they have suffered, the unique experience of the Shoah, for which we Europeans are responsible; I understand the fear that a bomb might explode under a bus or a shell hit a school, but these fears do not give anyone the right to occupy another people's territory or to violate international human rights. It is our responsibility not to allow any expression of anti-Semitism in Europe, guaranteeing to the Israelis that the safety of Israel is very important to us, just as the safety of the Palestinian people is very important to us. We have been saying for too long that we must stop the cycle of violence. What, then, is our policy? To urge the Israeli government to resume talks without delay and to put an end to the closing-off of the territories and the bombings. International protection for the Palestinians must be guaranteed – this request has been made by over 400 Israeli citizens as well as by the Palestinians – but, above all, the expansion of settlements and roads must stop. The Mitchell Commission also says this. Yesterday, in an article in the newspaper, Ha'aretz
, Daniel Bensimon condemned Mr Sharon's false motives in respect of the natural population expansion of the settlements. He cites sources of American intelligence which state that 20 000 houses have been emptied and that many settlers, even those who are most fanatical, are leaving. He writes that, if the government genuinely had the interests of the country at heart, it would put a freeze on new settlements. This would be a positive message to the Palestinians, the Arabs and the international community. Stopping the escalation of violence: the Palestinian Authority must make every endeavour to prevent extremism from prevailing. There are no military solutions. The European Union – as Parliament has stressed – must play a political role: international law must be applied in real life and not just proclaimed in declarations. In this sense, respect for the agreements signed by Israel must be ensured, including the agreement concluded with the European Union which lays down a ban on the exporting of goods produced in the settlements to Europe. Commissioner Patten has made this very clear, as has Mrs van der Laan. The resolution upon which Parliament is about to vote calls upon the Council and the Commission to consider whether collective punishments and the disproportionate use of force are not in conflict with the principles of the Association Agreement and to take the necessary action: our aim is not to punish, just to obtain respect for the rule of law. There is no time to lose in the struggle for peace: it is necessary for Palestinians and Israelis, for the region, but also for us.

 Mr President, suffering and tragedy will continue to mark the days and nights of the Palestinians and Israelis if the international community and the European Union do not decide to take firm action to restore the international and human rights violated by the Israeli government. The two sides are not equal: on the one hand, there is a State, which has never defined its borders, which is expanding its settlements and has one of the strongest armies in the world; on the other, there is an occupied people and an occupied territory, without either State or army, which is unable even to exercise any control over bean imports, let alone borders: since 29 September, this people has been besieged, bombed, its villages sealed off, with its sick dying at military check points, its doctors and nurses attacked and its parliament unable to meet. There is no European Union diplomat who does not speak openly of the way the Israeli government has contravened international rules. Human rights organisations such as the United Nations and Amnesty International and Israeli organisations such as Betrelem also condemn this. We must do something to restore the possibility of peace and put an end to the cycle of violence. The Palestinian Authority must make every endeavour to stop the terrorism perpetrated by Palestinian extremists but, on the other hand, the Sharon government in Israel is not sending out peace signals: murders outside the Occupied Territories, bombings, expansion of settlements, carte blanche for the settlers, who have bombed architectural structures in Hebron which are part of our human heritage. It is time for the European Union to find something which will convince the Israeli leaders: not sanctions or embargoes, given the disastrous results where that strategy has been adopted, but at least the suspension of the EU-Israel Association Agreement, which would probably suffice, according to Israeli organisations like Rabbis for Peace and others. I feel that this is extremely important: we must speak out for peace, but peace in respect for all ... (The President cut the speaker off)

 Madam President, I came back yesterday from Palestine, from Gaza, where I attended the plenary session of the Palestinian Legislative Council which was able to meet for the first time in six months, albeit under certain conditions: the members of the Palestinian parliament had to enter Gaza using Israeli public transport, they were unable to use their cars, they were subjected to searches and many of them were prevented from reaching their destination because of the territories being sealed off. On 7 March, in the middle of the night, 33 Palestinian villages – between Ramal and Birzeit, where there is a university – were completely sealed off by Israeli soldiers, who went so far as to use tanks and who dug trenches and destroyed 400 metres of paved land; 65 000 people are enclosed in those places. These are actions which, in my opinion, we can in no way endorse. I, therefore, call upon the President to make representations to Mr Solana and to present a protest at the way the University of Birzeit has been completely closed off. The students and teachers of Birzeit had not opened fire, nor had they taken any other hostile initiative: they were there simply to study. The situation has reached dramatic proportions. Israel cannot continue to violate the Geneva International Conventions and collective punishment is wrong. I do not endorse military or terrorist acts carried out by individual Palestinians or organisations, but collective punishment must be opposed because it is a form of tribal vendetta rather than a reaction. I therefore call upon the President to champion a protest to the Israeli government and to ask Mr Solana to authorise an immediate intervention to bring about the reopening of the occupied territories and put an end to the collective punishments inflicted on the Palestinian people, and to bring about the reopening of Birzeit and its university and the restoration of this people's right to education and life.

 Mr President, in Davos, President Arafat reiterated the need for peace and gave an honest account of the shameful, tragic living conditions of the Palestinian people, who are subjected to violations of human rights by the Israeli army. The media interpreted this as greater inflexibility on Arafat's part with regard to peace and criticised Peres for not standing up to him. The truth of the matter is that Peres knows that what Arafat is saying is true. The visit of our parliamentary delegation to the area also served to confirm this. The Palestinian people are forced to live in an open-air prison, the roads leading into and out of the villages are under military occupation and closed off, countless check points on the main roads prevent the Palestinians from reaching their places of work and collective punishments are enforced. This is just one example: Sabrine was born on 24 January at a check point. At the next check point her umbilical cord was cut. The mother had left the village of Antis at 5 p.m. and arrived at Ramallah hospital at 8.30 p.m. The journey should have taken 40 minutes. Her epic ordeal was recorded in the Israeli newspaper Ha’aretz. 
People who are seriously ill are turned back and medical staff beaten up. In Gaza, we saw hundreds of metres of land where enormous palm trees and olive and orange trees had been uprooted and destroyed, and houses demolished. It had become desert land. Was there something wrong with the trees? Only in that they could have served as cover for any Palestinian attacks against the settlers who are overrunning the country and treating it as theirs, destroying Palestinian houses and crops. Meanwhile, the number of settlers and settlements is increasing every day in what ought to be the State of Palestine, the territories which have been occupied since 1967. The Palestinian Legislative Council cannot function properly. The members of the different districts are unable to move about or to meet. Arafat himself said that his movements are hampered. Others have spoken of the tragic stifling of the economy. Imports and exports are blocked, and the European Union is witness to that: every day, the Commission in Jerusalem receives notification of the various violations; 
even 
civil structures and schools provided by the European Union have been bombed. These are economic disasters whose effects will be felt for years to come. All this is well-known, and none of us, particularly those in responsible political positions, can say that they were unaware of the facts. Our diplomats send back clear reports on the Israeli settlement policy and also clear reports – as we told all the Palestinian leaders we met – of the violations performed by the National Palestinian Authority. But they all asked us – from Arafat to the men and women in the refugee camps – why Europe does not intervene in an active, political way. "We have confidence in Europe," they said, "and a political partnership with the Middle and Near East would benefit Europe." This is our view as well: Europe must be able to develop an effective foreign policy which is in line with the fundamental values which we always claim to hold: respect for international laws and human rights. In terms of Palestine, that means upholding the UN Resolutions. There is a pragmatic strain in the Palestinians; we have witnessed it and it was evident at Taba as well: they are pragmatic in implementation but resolute when it comes to principles and rights. We, too, should have realised this, for we are always discussing it. 
Mr Solana is right: Europe is now playing a larger role but it must do much more. The United States has failed: our task is not to replace it but to become equal partners in the negotiations. It is not enough for us to provide economic aid: what we are being asked for – and our responsibility... (The President cut the speaker off)

 Mr President, I would like to thank Mrs Theorin for her excellent report and for the initiatives it proposes. As a feminist and a pacifist who is involved, together with other women, in building relations and bridges of peace in places of conflict, I have found that this report contains the wealth of experience gained from many peace-building projects carried out by women in recent years. Peace is more than the absence of war: it is recognition of economic and social justice. It is true that we women are those who suffer most in war zones but we are more than just victims: we are the bearers of alternatives to war and violence and the builders and protagonists of change. There is the example of the international network of the 'Women in Black' who are against war and violence and have been demonstrating for 12 years in Israel against the military occupation of Palestine, in dialogue and solidarity with Palestinian women. We women Members of Parliament also saw them during our visit to the Middle East at this tragic time. Similarly, during the war in the former Yugoslavia, the 'Women in Black' of Belgrade built up relationships with Croatian and Bosnian women. In various different countries of the world, we have transcended borders, united in the refusal to abide by national allegiance. But these projects and the skills which women have, diplomacy on a practical level, which provides an alternative to State diplomacy, can no longer be disregarded; they must be used in decision-making forums and at all levels of diplomacy. This is why more women must be involved in negotiations, in prevention operations, in management ... (The President cut the speaker off)

 Mr President, reinvigorating the Barcelona Process and giving it direction means not just concerning ourselves with the free market and economic and trade concerns but, in effect, relaunching a policy of cooperation and development and defence of human rights throughout the area. It means bringing about the necessary social reforms, focusing on employment, the need to revitalise the economy in the southern countries and the reduction and cancellation of debt as central issues. It means promoting economic, cultural and political exchange between the southern countries themselves as well as with the northern countries. It means ensuring that civil society plays a greater role. However, we must not ignore the fact that the Barcelona Process has entered a critical stage, caused not only by lack of impetus or a slow down in the European undertaking in respect of the events in the Balkans or enlargement, but also by the conditions of tragic open conflict in the Mediterranean which are holding back reinvigoration. The Palestinian question has once again become central. Commissioner Patten has said that we must not be hostages to the Palestine-Israel situation. That is true, but we cannot avoid it. If we do not tackle very soon the issue of the recognition of a Palestinian State, a State which can coexist with Israel, if military occupation of the West Bank and the Gaza Strip does not cease, the issue cannot be resolved. It must be resolved, first and foremost, of course, in order to put an end to the suffering of the Palestinian people, but also in order to bring more stability to the region. I hope that when the Conference of Ministers of the Union meets in Marseilles, it will be able to adopt a position on this matter which is coherent with what is always pompously stressed, that human rights must not be violated. It is essential to reinvigorate the Process and we must do so, but we must do so in the knowledge that we cannot escape the central issue of the Mediterranean.

 Mr President, even in common parlance the word 'mine' indicates danger, and if an Italian describes someone as 'una mina' they are calling that person a loose canon. The European Union must be united in its action and ensure that the production of landmines is stopped, that all stockpiles are destroyed and that the ground is cleared of mines, and that assistance and means of social and economic inclusion is provided for their victims, who include many children, while safeguarding the development of the community affected. In this sense, there must be a sharp focus on the issue and actions must be undertaken to further raise awareness in order to prevent the matter fading into obscurity. Both the report and the opinions of the Committees, which we are presenting today, stress the driving role played by Parliament and the European Union in the abolition of landmines and in the provision of financial aid to the UN. As Mrs Bonino said, very clearly and explicitly, the Commission's proposal for a regulation is a further step forward. We have tabled several amendments intended to achieve greater clarity and transparency and to consolidate and rationalise the budget lines and our endeavours in the areas of mine clearance and stockpile destruction. These endeavours are carried out in conjunction with many NGOs, to whom all credit is due for convincing people that it is impossible to defer the issue any more. The Union does, however, have a weak point – a number of weak points – namely that we need to put pressure on Finland, which has not yet signed the Ottawa Convention, and on Greece, which has not ratified it, or Europe will lack credibility when it promotes the adherence of all countries to the Convention and raises the question – which we have also raised in the oral question which we are going to put to the Commission – of whether the candidate countries have to sign the Ottawa Convention before they become Members of the Union. The Unmine Monitor
 report for 2000 clearly shows the progress achieved through the Ottawa Convention. There has certainly been a reduction on a world-wide scale in terms of production and trade and stockpiles etc., with a fall in the number of victims, although the figures are still too high. A great many issues remain unresolved, especially since countries such as the United States have not yet signed the Convention and countries such as China and Russia hold enormous stockpiles. Europe must find a way to ensure that these stockpiles are eliminated from history but linger in our memories as a reminder that we must stop killing people with our lethal products.

And so, in this spirit, we invite the women of the European Parliament to be part of this delegation. We will make an appeal on Tuesday and Wednesday and collect the names and signatures of those women who wish to be part of the delegation.

 Madam President, Mohamed was one of the many babies killed by the Israeli army. Eight years on from the signing of the peace agreements, the army still occupies over 80 % of the territories. The settlers have opened fire. How can we describe these new massacres and this Palestinian rebellion. More stone-throwing youths? It is more than that. The Palestinian security forces are also firing. The explosion had been brewing for months: it is difficult to believe in peace when you consider that the number of settlers has grown from 141 000 to over 200 000 since the signing of the peace agreements; when you cannot find work to support your children, which is the case of my friend Talal who works as a builder in the settlements, maybe even on the land which used to belong to his family; it is difficult when the soldiers stop you from moving around. Ariel Sharon was the catalyst but the responsibility also lies with the government which allowed him to visit the holy site and did not stop the soldiers firing on the crowd. While condemning all forms of violence, we cannot make any parallel between the Israeli violence and the Palestinian violence. On the one hand, there is a state and an army occupying a territory in breach of all international laws and, on the other, there is a people who is tired of suffering and humiliation. This is not the work of Hamas: it is the uprising of a people who have had enough of being oppressed and are not being given satisfaction even by their own leaders and decision-makers. It is the revolt of the Palestinians who live in Israel who are not only demonstrating their solidarity with their brothers but demanding to be treated as citizens with full rights and to be allowed to live free from discrimination in Israel. We must play our part in bringing the violence to an end and re-establishing negotiations: the fighting must cease, the Israeli soldiers must be withdrawn, there must be an international inquiry, at which Europe must be present, and the Palestinian people must be protected. It would be enough for the European Union and the UN to make it clear that the UN resolutions, starting with resolutions 338, 242 and 194 on the return of refugees to their homes, apply. This would in itself have a major impact and could change Israel's – by now – firm conviction that it can always do whatever it likes with impunity. The right of the State of Israel to exist and to security is very important to us, as are the Israelis themselves who, together with the Palestinians, are currently demonstrating that they have had enough of occupation and enough of this violence. But the rights of the Palestinian State are no less important. In my opinion, Europe can and must do a great deal in this direction, and it must be clear and resolute. It is true that peace is achieved through dialogue but rights have to be respected, and here rights are not being respected. It is not a question of the Israelis making concessions; we must enforce the law.

 Mr President, I have to confess to a certain nostalgia for the times when the European Parliament – and the various pacifist movements and trade unions – used to call urgently for dedication and action in order to steadily reduce arms manufacturing, and we would discuss ways of converting military production into civilian production. I still feel that this must be our approach, that we must not give in before the inevitability of war and conflict and that the defence policy must not provide for large-scale arms production, but that Europe must adopt an defence policy of intervention where it is not weapons that count but the ability to intervene peacefully in order to find non-violent solutions to disputes. That said, since I am a dreamer whose feet are firmly on the ground, I will hold onto my dreams and work towards their realisation. I feel that it is important, as stated in the opinion of the Committee on Industry, External Trade, Research and Energy itself, which is attached to the report, that the code of conduct – and we can deduce this from the annual report which we examined – has led to steps forward in the area of controlling and rationalising arms exports from the European Union. In this sense, the Titley report is particularly efficient and highlights not only the merits but also the omissions, the innate limitations of the Council's report and of the feasibility of implementing the code of conduct. I would like to emphasise certain points which appear to be particularly important: making the code of conduct legally binding, actively working towards drawing up an international code of conduct on the transfer of arms, making implementation of the code of conduct more transparent – in order to better assess its effectiveness – for example, providing information relating to the number and type of weapons for which licences have been granted and to the identity of exporting countries and countries of destination, conducting checks on intermediaries and brokers, putting an end to the current practice of selling European Union arms in areas of war or where human rights are blatantly violated. Another major point is the ban on exporting, promoting and selling equipment and expertise which is, in practice, to be used for the purposes of torture. There are a great many other important points, but I would just like to end by saying that transparency dictates a greater involvement of national parliaments at decision-making level and the participation of NGOs.

 Mr President, I arrived back yesterday from Palestine and Israel, where over a thousand Italians – representatives of district, provincial and regional councils – have been spending a week building peace bridges between Palestinians and Israelis and setting up projects for cooperation with the Palestinian people. Jerusalem is at the centre of the conflict, and it is one of the key factors in the peace process. For the Palestinians it is a town to be shared with East Jerusalem as the capital of the Palestinian State and West Jerusalem as the capital of the State of Israel. For the Israelis, before Camp David, no part of Jerusalem could be touched. Now the taboo has been broken. Yet the Israeli negotiators are still extremely uncompromising, for the problem is not that the Palestinians do not want to make concessions but that they have the right to the return of the territories occupied in 1967 which is enshrined in the UN resolutions. Since 1993, Jerusalem has been a closed city for the Palestinians. As Commissioner Patten said, the Israeli Government has many times failed in its obligations following the Oslo negotiations: they have not adhered to the timetable laid down in the agreements for the withdrawal of troops from the occupied territories. For the Palestinians, the divided territories are a nightmare. There is no free movement and over a thousand prisoners arrested before 1993 have been held in prison as if they were hostages. Their imprisonment is a constant threat to the peace process. However, a genuine tragedy for the peace process and the future of the Palestinian State is the continued increase in Israeli settlements: under the Barak Government, over 41 000 settlers moved into in the occupied territories. And I, together with the thousand Italians, saw these settlements expanding all over the place. This is a genuine crime against peace, but also against the environment and nature: just one example is the mountain of Jellab Edumin, a green hill outside Jerusalem which has been destroyed by bulldozers. Another key factor are the refugees: they are not merchandise but human beings who want to realise their right or their dream to live in their own land or see it once again. It is makes no sense for them not to be able to go back: Palestinians, who were born there, are not even allowed to visit it. Peace is necessary. It is on everyone's lips, but peace can only be achieved if each person is allowed to exercise his right of citizenship in his own free State. As Europeans, we must make every possible endeavour – over and above the economic efforts which we are already making, we must increase our political role – to ensure that the law prevails and that the Palestinians are able to live in their democratic State, which we must recognise as we recognise the Israeli State, so that Jerusalem becomes an open city, a city of the world, the capital city of two peoples and two States.

 Mr President, too many tragedies have taken place, both inside and outside stadiums: incidents which are evidence of the imbalance and social unease of individuals, a culture where strength is what matters and violence prevails over reason.  The resolution reiterates Parliament's concern over the spread of hooliganism, and calls for preventive measures which I support. However, it is crucial that in this, of all situations, the difficulty of their task does not make the forces of the law lose their heads as well. At this point, I would like to protest at the behaviour of the Dutch police towards some Italian journalists who were filming the humiliating treatment of a group of disabled people who were being carried up the steps because there were not enough free seats for them. The journalists were prevented from doing their job and were beaten up, thrown to the ground and arrested. The film shown this morning here in Parliament contained pictures which leave no doubt as to the express intention of the police to suppress the freedom of the press. Different interpretations have been given of the event, and so we call upon the Dutch authorities to hold an inquiry in order to find out who was responsible, and we demand that this sort of incident is never repeated.

 Mr President, I am convinced that any type of embargo apart from an arms embargo is a violation of human rights and ineffective in combating authoritarian regimes. My visit to Iraq made me even more intolerant of the fact that, in the name of the defence of democracy and the rights of the Iraqi people, oppressed by Saddam Hussein, we are killing a people and destroying a country. This is intellectual genocide. The head of the World Aid Program has said so. We have seen the victims in the hospitals: children with their mothers who look at you with staring eyes and haunt your sleep; doctors who watch the agony, powerless to do anything.  The Oil for Food programme stipulates that any imported goods must be screened by the exemption committee; million dollar contracts are delayed for years for fear that the goods may have a dual use: medicines, spare parts, medical equipment and graphite-tipped pencils are all prevented from entering the country. There are no airlines offering flights to Baghdad, although there are no UN resolutions banning such flights either, because the USA and the United Kingdom have declared a no-fly zone. I call upon Europe to stop vacillating and suspend the embargo, with the exception of the arms embargo, unilaterally, reinstating civilian aircraft flights. We must trust the Iraqi people to bring about democracy in Iraq! One young girl from the Iraqi opposition, Rabye, said to me, while the bombs were falling on her village, 'You are even destroying our dream of building our own democracy ourselves'.

 Mr President, there have been deaths which weigh like heavy stones on our hearts and our consciences, deaths which call for a European reception policy, a policy of rights and duties for migrants, a policy which says: in Europe, nobody is a foreigner and nobody is illegal.  Since 1993, 2063 victims – men, women and children – have died in the struggle to be allowed to live: the earth’s rejects, suffocating in containers, drowning in our seas and committing suicide in detention centres. The responsibility lies with the traffickers who now form an international network, and the Union will be forced to employ every means and exploit all possible cooperation between countries in order to break these criminal networks; the responsibility lies with a policy which meets the needs of migrant communities with closed borders; an emergency and security policy which induces fear of invasion. Yet immigration from regions near and far is part and parcel of the history of Europe. We will overcome illegal trafficking when we tackle the causes of the gap between rich and poor countries, when we practise a policy of cooperation and development which allows everyone to live as a citizen of the world.

 Mr President, one year on from the end of the NATO bombing of Yugoslavia, the situation is unstable and the opposing forces in Serbia are giving increasing cause for concern. The daily news is witness to the oppressive actions of the Yugoslavian government. Opposition is struck down and intimidated in the ways traditionally adopted by governments who feel insecure: newspapers and radio stations are closed down, equipment confiscated, various groups and non-governmental organisations intimidated and there are random arrests and trials with unjustified sentences such as the case of Flora Brovina. Many of the men, women and students who are victims of oppression today are the same people who have courageously spoken up in these past years, calling for peace, freedom and respect for human rights, and who have, in reality, been abandoned even by Europe. However, the situation in Kosovo is equally worrying, where the oppressed have become the oppressors, and this has been said by Kofi Annan, Solana and Kouchner. In the space of a year, 240 000 Serbs, Roma, 
Gorancs and Jews have fled from Kosovo in terror. And those who have remained are regularly attacked and, in many cases, killed. The most recent UNHCR/OSCE report states clearly that, in Kosovo, minorities have no access to education, health and public services and no freedom of movement. And it is not only the minorities who are in this situation: even the Albanian Kosovars who are openly against the vendettas or for democracy in Kosovo live under threat and in fear of their lives.  Leaders such as Rugova are familiar with the situation, but even more in touch are those women who, together with Serbian, Bosnian and European women – the ‘Women in Black’ against war – have in recent years managed to maintain relations and build peaceful bridges. Some of them have had to leave Kosovo and others have been forced to remain silent. In Serbia, the centre of the ‘Women in Black’ 
is currently under threat of closure.  In my opinion, Europe, and, in particular, the 19 NATO countries, should undertake a large-scale self-appraisal operation and revise its policies. The crimes and unlawful acts committed by NATO against civilians are now universally acknowledged. In the interests of the protection of human rights, we must not violate international regulations and we must start by observing the Geneva Convention. At this point, let us mention fundamental freedoms: for these freedoms to be established the embargo policy must be abolished. We must not treat civilians in this way, and the democratic Serbian opposition which is still today at the mercy of Milosevic is calling for us to change our policy. It may be that we should be the ones to give them strong support in Serbia and Kosovo. We owe it to ourselves, but, most of all, we owe it to a wonderful little boy from Kosovo called Felt who said to me while we were eating an ice-cream one day: ‘This war has turned us all into nastier people’.

 Mr President, the Beijing +5 Conference has not actually made any significant progress in achieving the aims defined in the Beijing 1995 action programme. The women’s march for equal opportunities and the affirmation of differences still has a long way to go and is effectively full of dangerous paths. This became clear in New York when Islamic fundamentalists attacked what, in recent years, has characterised women’s demands: an end to domestic rape and violence, an end to the right for men to commit crimes passionnelles
 and an end to female circumcision. However, it must, of course, be appreciated – as Commissioner Patten said, moreover – that the Conference as a whole confirmed and consolidated women’s rights as human rights.  However, similar positions on sexual rights, sexual health and the self-determination of women have caused an unholy alliance – evident at Beijing – to be formed between Christian and Islamic fundamentalists, including the Vatican, Poland, Nicaragua and a number of Islamic countries.  Furthermore, I feel that mainstreaming and empowerment were consolidated in this Conference, and also the fight against poverty and trafficking in human beings, but that there was an absence of tangible, verifiable objectives such as the need for a greater representation of women in the institutions and also for projects to fight poverty. I welcome the positive contribution made by Europe to forging closer relationships with other countries and the NGOs.

 I abstained from the vote on the joint resolution on poor countries’ debt because I feel that it is wishy-washy and ambiguous in the face of the financial mechanisms known to us all which plunge the greater part of humanity into the most abject poverty. Today, even the multilateral organisations such as the World Bank and the IMF are talking of reducing the debt, for the mechanisms stifling the economies no longer make sense, even from a neoliberal perspective. At the June 1999 G7 Summit, the United States, the United Kingdom and other countries talked of reducing the poor countries’ debt to 90%. If we look closely at these proposals, we see that they would not really be a solution, for if these measures were to be applied, they would only affect 8% or, at most, 10% of the debt of the 41 countries involved, which is, at the outside, 1% of the total Third World debt.  But these same measures are given minimal application, which has tragic consequences for the indebted countries, but which benefits the creditors themselves in terms of export loans, financial bodies and multinationals, for example. First of all, we must acknowledge that the Third World debt is illegal. Therefore, the European Union should promote an international, bilateral and multilateral action cancelling the Third World debt with no conditions attached. The Member States must cancel the debts of the poor countries in practical terms and urge the international bodies which represent them to take similar steps. We must ensure that the cancellation of debts is not conditional upon cooperation, as is often the case, or linked to any sort of structural adjustment measure. We have to influence the financial mechanisms which caused this debt and the structural adjustment policies which continue to contribute to it, spreading poverty throughout these countries.

 I am quite aware of the inconsistencies in the common organisation of the market in bananas and associated relations with the WTO. It is difficult to take into account the various requirements and follow a policy which will favour the weakest parties and supply a high-quality product at affordable prices. Having said that, it is not that I do not think it is possible, as put forward in the Commission proposal, to adopt, as of 2006, a system which does not impose quota restrictions or tariffs on ACP countries or any other countries. Postponing this until 2010 would not make much difference, although that would undoubtedly give us more time to find less damaging solutions.  The Commission’s proposal is too similar to the proposal of the Council of Ministers, which does not consider it necessary to allocate part of the budget to a policy of cooperation and protection of the Community’s primary producers in accordance with WTO negotiations. Rather than adapting to the WTO system, we should endeavour to reform it without giving in to blackmail by US multinationals which make a profit out of exploiting poor countries. We are all aware of the illiberal acts of these multinationals, which are destroying and corrupting both people and the environment. The challenge should be to reform the WTO. The Seattle Summit and the huge public demonstrations made the need plain. We must reform the WTO, without adversely affecting development and protection policies for poor countries, small producers and craftsmen, but, as per the Dary report on facilitating access to the market for fair-trade organisations in order to invest in environmentally-friendly and socially viable farming practices. This should be the European Union’s policy.

 Mr President, during these last few days, Parliament has been watching an extraordinarily powerful documentary on the effects of the sanctions on Iraq, and I would like to thank Patricia McKenna for this. Civilians, men, women and children are dying because of the sanctions. I will not repeat the figures, for we are all aware of them and they have been quoted many times in this Chamber. But what a contradiction. What a tragedy. In the name of the protection of human rights, the rich, powerful countries of the West are killing communities and starving them to death. During the war in Yugoslavia, American aircraft continuously bombarded towns, killing civilians. It is better to tell the truth and admit that the interests of the United States take precedence over those of communities.  Today, we are going to vote on a motion, a very important motion for a resolution calling for an end to the sanctions, an end to the embargo. I feel that we must then act in order to give practical effect to our resolution. There is no doubt about the fact that it is important for Iraq to change its policy and that the existing arms must be monitored and decommissioned, but, in this regard, there is abundant documented evidence that the nuclear and chemical weapons have already been decommissioned. And that is essential. However, I also feel that a clear policy must be developed for the decommissioning of nuclear weapons where they exist in the Middle East. For example, Israel is full of nuclear weapons and no one is asking Israel to decommission. Unfortunately, even the resolution called for by Egypt was not supported by the European Parliament in Cairo. We must do everything possible to free this world from the nuclear threat.  Today, I would also like to pay tribute to Dennis Halliday – mentioned by Ms McKenna as well – who was responsible for the oil-for-food deal. In a world of hypocrites and careerists, Dennis Halliday had the courage to speak out over the implications of the sanctions on the Iraqi people and to condemn the lies of the United States departments. Saddam Hussein is certainly responsible and guilty, but we are also incurring a great deal of responsibility and guilt in continuing with a policy which maintains the population of a country in extreme poverty, a population such as the Iraqi people, with a rich history and culture, a population made up of people, women, children, who want to live. I hope that when the embargo imposed on Iraq is lifted, this will be the end of all embargoes everywhere throughout the world. This is important for all of us.

 Mr President, once again we protest and call upon the Turkish Government to release a prisoner who is guilty of the desire to live in a country where democracy, rights and freedom are truly respected. Akin Birdal is not a Kurd. He is a Turk, a man of peace, condemned for speaking out about the Kurdish issue and calling for an end to this dirty war. His imprisonment is the product of an illiberal legal system, the abolition of which Turkish democrats are fighting for, a legal system which has made hundreds and hundreds of citizens suffer. No one who has met him could forget his smile and gentle nature. And yet he has had to endure great suffering.  This is not the first time he has been arrested and an armed attack has been made on his life; he escaped with his life, but he was unable to leave the country and was rearrested. Leyla Azan is still in prison, and so are thousands of Kurds. When will this end? There is no justification for the behaviour of the Turkish Government. The KWP has stopped fighting and its leader, Mr Öçalan, is calling from jail for peace, reconciliation and recognition of the cultural identity of his people. The European Union has accepted Turkey’s candidacy and now the Turkish Government must respect our agreements and conventions. We must explore every possible avenue, save military interventions and embargoes, starting with a refusal to sell Turkey any more arms, so that, at last, democracy and freedom can be established in Turkey.  (Applause)

 Madam President, I call upon you, our President, but also upon the Council and the Commission to clarify certain questions, raised by the events of the last few days, with the Turkish government. Firstly, the existence of a blacklist of Members of Parliament and representatives of NGOs whom the Turkish government deems undesirable. Secondly, the arrest, which took place at the very time when a delegation from the European Parliament was visiting Turkey, of Akin Birdal, a human rights campaigner who, apart from anything else, was in a very poor state of health when he was taken back into custody. In addition to this, there has been a marked return to suppression of journalistic activities, which has been documented in a report by other sources as well.  We feel that these actions taken by Turkey against Members of Parliament are cause for very serious concern. I would like the Turkish government to be asked to clarify whether blacklists also exist for European countries other than Italy.

 Mr President, the Confederal Group of the European United Left are extremely concerned at the stagnation of the Mediterranean partnership and we see can no justification for the Commission and the Council’s reluctance to reopen the debate. And yet two of the fundamental causes of the breakdown in the debate have now been eliminated: a new Commission is installed in Brussels which numbers the creation of a Euro-Mediterranean area of peace and stability among one of its priorities, and peace negotiations between Israel, Palestine, Syria and the Lebanon are once again in progress.  It is time for Europe to send a political signal to reopen negotiations with non-member countries of the Mediterranean, and this is why we welcome the idea from the future French presidency of the Council of organising another Euro-Mediterranean Conference. However, the agenda must tackle the central issues and not skirt around them, as it currently threatens to do. We are also concerned at the total lack of interest shown by the Commission in reopening the debate. And yet much remains to be done in order to relaunch the three cooperation chapters decided upon in Barcelona. A large workshop needs to be opened on promoting the protection of human rights in the area of justice, in a framework of mutual respect, for we cannot make concessions for anybody on human rights issues, not even civil Europe.  For a long time now, Parliament has been proposing to create a Euro-Mediterranean Court of Human Rights modelled on the Court in Strasbourg, and also to set up mutual consultation mechanisms to facilitate applications for peaceful solutions to conflicts and the fight against organised crime. Political dialogue must be structured and take the form of regular consultations. To this end, we propose that Summits of the Heads of State and Government of the Mediterranean countries of the European Union should be held regularly, and that the role of the special envoy for the Middle East should be consolidated, so that we do not relinquish the political role we desire to the United States. There is now no reason to exclude Libya from the debate, and it should therefore take part in the next Euro-Mediterranean Conference.  With regard to economic and financial cooperation, the Commission has the duty to relaunch negotiations for the signing of trade contracts which are socially sustainable. This is extremely important, for the mutual benefits are very great. At the same time, however, I would stress that the bilateral approach hitherto adopted by the Commission does not seem adequate to meet the numerous challenges presented by the Mediterranean. Economic cooperation must include multilateral/bilateral approaches facilitating the promotion of trade among Mediterranean countries and south-south trade. This multilateral approach must also be mirrored in the fields of cultural and social cooperation. The promotion of a culture of diversity, of individual freedoms applicable to all members of a multi-cultural society, of peaceful coexistence and of dialogue across religious divides with respect for universal human rights, and the affirmation of women’s rights and freedom, hinges on multilateral cooperation programmes, which must include a number of countries. In this sense, it is essential, in addition to being the Union’s responsibility, to support democratic organisations from the civil society of Mediterranean countries and parliamentary dialogue modelled on the Euro-Mediterranean Forum.  Mr President, Commissioner, Mr President-in-Office of the Council, the need to create a Euro-Mediterranean area of peace, economic justice, citizenship and stability is common to both sides of the Mediterranean. It is a major challenge, a foreign policy which the Community institutions must undertake to pursue in order to provide the Union with a political and cultural project which will bring about peaceful coexistence and growth in the face of different territorial and cultural conditions, and, putting aside the myths and legends of days gone by, make the Mediterranean a genuinely peaceful area, and not one of conflict or of abuse of power or where impoverished immigrants lose their lives attempting to reach Europe.

 I would like to thank the rapporteur, Mrs Ferrer, for the recommendation on the implementation of certain articles of the EC-Mexico Interim Agreement on trade. The report is thorough, but I am afraid that I do not agree with the choices and recommendations it makes, although we do welcome some of the criticisms mentioned. However, these criticisms are decisive, and have led us to oppose the motion. I refer, for example, to the insufficient democratic transparency displayed leading up to the agreement, and we, along with all the other Members I imagine, have received a great deal of criticism on this point from both Mexican and European civil organisations, as Mr Kreissl-Dörfler said.  We are particularly concerned by the fact that the rapporteur is satisfied with the progress made by Mexico in the area of human rights and democracy since the application of the global agreement. We now have conflicting evidence revealing an increase in violations of human rights, supplied not only by civil society but also by UN representatives and officials, by Mary Robinson herself, by the Inter-American Commission on Human Rights and by many other sources. The most serious violations include the systematic use of torture, illegal arrests, disappearances, executions by paramilitary death squads, the arrest of trade unionists, bans on strikes and allegations of enforced sterilisation in the State of Guererro. At the same time, the Saint Andrés agreements and the rights of the indigenous peasants are not being observed. All this is common knowledge and I need say no more.  We believe, along with the German and Belgian Governments, that we should enforce observance of Article 1 of the Treaty, which contains the fundamental principle, and adopt instruments and set in place practical controls to ensure its implementation.  There are many other aspects of this agreement which, we feel, require correction: I will give just one example – it reveals a European Union economic policy which does not take into consideration the social and economic situation in Mexico or its human development. The EU-Mexico Agreement could have negative implications if it does not take into account the need for balanced development, and not uncontrolled liberalisation, which could lead to greater poverty and inequality.

 The people of the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia are still living in terrible conditions, battered by their own government’s policy of homicide and suicide, NATO shelling and the embargoes of the international community. Any democratic opposition is difficult, not only because of suppression by the Serbian authorities but also because of the deprivation suffered by the whole of the population, for which the international community is partly responsible. The result is yet more conflict and violence. Today, we want to express our solidarity with the journalists and democrats whose rights have been violated and declare our commitment to fighting the Milosevic Government’s suppression of the freedom of the press and the freedom of speech. The Serbian authorities are suppressing newspapers, independent radio stations and any radio stations which acknowledge opposition groups or parties. I would just like to mention the example of the Studio B operators who, in addition to being pressurised by heavy fines from the authorities, saw their equipment destroyed by hired masked vandals.  In this regard, an appeal has been made to the Serbian authorities, calling upon them to bring their criminal inquiries to a close in order to punish those guilty of crimes, to put an end to the increasing suppression and to amend the recent law limiting the freedom of the media. We call for economic support from the European Union for the independent press, but also an economic aid programme for Serbia, to assist the entire afflicted population and to help make it possible for the people of Serbia to at last live in peace and to elect a democratic government.

 A heartfelt thank you to the rapporteurs for their work. More and more, we need to follow our words with actions. Disrespect for human rights, racism, xenophobia and antisemitism are not confined to other continents, but are also present here, within ourselves, our lives and our institutions. Even in this Parliament, fascist and xenophobic opinions are expressed. We must start with ourselves if we want to build a world where everyone helps each other. We will be able to intervene more effectively in countries which deny the existence of human and social rights – whether these are the rights of Kurds, Palestinians, Chechens or the rights of Afghan women – if we avoid hypocrisy.  Europe is full of Haiders. We are Haiders when, to give the minor example of an incident which took place in Rome last week, Bosnian Roma refugees are deported with the approval of the mayor and sent back without aid to places of conflict; children and mothers, brothers and sisters separated, without even the time to gather together any belongings to take with them; children born in Italy snatched away from their schools where they have become integrated and made good friends with the other pupils. We are Haiders when, in Rome, parties of the right-wing opposition and the new centre incite the people to hatred and prevent the authorities from accommodating the Roma safely in places with running water and electricity. And this does not mean that I do not condemn the unlawful behaviour of many Roma and other immigrants.  I would like to be able to share with everyone my conviction that, in our countries, no one is a stranger. For this reason I give my full support to the proposals contained in the resolutions which promote and lend support to all those elements which contribute to a culture of peaceful coexistence and all-embracing citizenship.

 What we are about to discuss is really very simple: the respect, application and monitoring of the agreements subscribed to by the European Union, and compliance with the Treaties and international standards to which it adheres. It is very simple, but in this world the simplest things are very often the hardest things to achieve. The goal of my colleagues who joined me in tabling this question to the Commission is this: the correct application of the EC-Israel trade agreement, which – we not only have reason to believe but, together with several Member States, have concrete proof – is being blatantly violated by Israel. At the same time, we also have reason to believe that the Commission is failing to attend to one of its primary functions: guardianship of the Community Treaties. I refer to Article 38 of the territorial requirement which restricts the scope to the territory of the State of Israel and thus does not grant special customs arrangements for products coming from the territories which were occupied by Israeli armed forces in June 1967 and upon which, in breach of all the international rules, from the fourth Geneva Convention onwards, the different Israeli governments have built settlements, confiscating Palestinian land and water and installing their own people.  This is not the first time that the Commission and Parliament have tackled this issue: I will only cite here the Commission’s report to the Council and Parliament, published in May 1998, which did not accept Israel’s refusal to apply the protocol of the rules of origin as laid down in Article 38. In spite of this, the Commission was not able to induce Israel to respect these agreements, and only gave vague responses to parliamentary questions, maintaining that it was difficult to obtain reliable proof of the provenance of products, although it has consistently, and quite rightly, made the legal obligations imposed by the agreement clear to Israel. In order to make it easier for the Commission and the Member States to get hold of reliable evidence, an Israeli peace movement published a list of companies established in the settlements, and a Palestinian NGO prepared and presented the customs services of the various Member States with unequivocal proof attesting to the State of origin of a range of products coming from the occupied territories and traded on domestic Community markets. I will mention but a few, which are produced in the Golan Heights and the occupied territories: wine and other products. This is a time of peace in Palestine and Israel: right now the credibility and observance of the legal effect of treaties and agreements is important if the European Union and Parliament want to play an active political role. Israel can be certain that Europe is in favour of its security and stability, but it cannot ask us to be party to such grave violations. The Palestinians know that the European Union is in favour of the consolidation of their State and their rights, but they have no proof of this. Peace cannot be founded on the violation of rights – Israelis such as the soldier Igal Moshe, who refused to go to the Lebanon four days ago and who is now in prison, are proof of this; Palestinians who still want peace, despite the fact that their houses have been levelled and that, 50 years on, they are still refugees, are proof of this; above all, respect for ourselves and for the democratic principles which we have laid down for ourselves demand it. Allow me to say, however, on a more practical level, that, for the same Member States and the Union, this also concerns the loss of economic resources taken from European citizens in violation of human and economic rights.

The government is talking to trade union and Goodyear delegates in Italy as well, in an endeavour to find a solution to the closure policy unilaterally adopted by the North American multinational in Cisterna di Latina, an area of Central Italy which has already been affected by other restructuring operations. The closure means the direct or indirect loss of more than a thousand jobs and hundreds of families being abandoned to insecurity and sudden poverty. The Goodyear workers are putting up a magnificent fight, in the knowledge that they are defending not only their own interests but the interests of the Goodyear workers in the different European countries as well, and there are many of them: France, Germany, the United Kingdom, Poland, Luxembourg and Slovenia.  Today, a small delegation of workers is here with us in the gallery, anxious to find out what their future will be, what solidarity the European Union will offer them and what policy it will adopt to prevent the multinationals acting solely and exclusively in the interest of their own market and profits. The European Union, in all of its aspects, must use all of its powers to resolve this and other disputes.

 All who are in contact with real life in Kosovo share the same opinion: it is a tragic, desperate situation where there is a democratic void and no possibility of the different ethnic groups living peacefully side by side. Mitrovica is a tragic example of this. Before military intervention by NATO, Milosevic’s policy for Kosovo was certainly to be condemned, and the demands of the non-violent forces of the Rugovo era for the Kosovar regions to be autonomous were justified. But NATO’s decision for military intervention and the KLA’s support for the armed forces had a devastating effect and have reduced Kosovo to a colony, as well as destroying civil infrastructures in Serbia. Today, Kosovo has no adequate strategy for protecting minority groups, and these include not only Serbs and Roma, but also moderate Albanians who still believe in the possibility of peaceful coexistence and are persecuted by the extremists in power. It is useless to talk of the Roma houses which have been burnt down and the thousands upon thousands of new refugees and the refugees from Krajina, who are now living, barricaded in, in Kosovo, abandoned by the UNHCR, which itself has been abandoned by the donors, while the emergency is still of dramatic proportions. In the joint resolution, we ask the Council and the Member States to double their efforts to ensure respect for minority groups and to work towards the creation of democratic structures, giving a voice to all those forces which still believe in peaceful coexistence. In this sense, I am in agreement with Mr Sakellariou’s proposals. Another subject being discussed is the release of the Albanians held in prisons, particularly Flora Brovina, a woman of extraordinary humanity whom I met, together with the Women in Black of Belgrade, during joint attempts to build bridges between women from different ethnic groups. Flora defended herself, and asked Serbs and Albanians to shake hands. Flora Brovina’s husband is the guest of Serbian women in Belgrade. This is a sign of hope, the hope that it possible to act differently even in Serbia. It is not true that Flora Brovina has been abandoned. She might well have been abandoned by the large institutions, but we, who worked in Kosovo and Serbia for many years, are doing our utmost to campaign for her release.  I believe that the European Union must do likewise. The embargo on Serbia must be lifted and Serbia must, in turn, release its political prisoners.

 Mr President, I would like to thank Commissioner Patten very much for the awareness he has demonstrated of the difficulties inherent in the peace process and the challenge that the European Union is taking on to bring it to completion.  It is high time there was peace in the Middle East. It is time to end the era which began with the Balfour declaration in 1917 and the Arab-Israeli war of 1948. It is time there were secure borders and political, social and economic rights in every country in this region, and that human rights were recognised and upheld in Syria, Palestine, Israel and everywhere else. This is an exercise in sovereignty, and in democracy for each population and every individual, but to this end it is vital for all parties in the conflict to have the courage to strive for peace and rights, and to recognise the other as its partner and not as its subject to whom concessions must be given. I refer principally to the Palestine-Israel question, but the same also applies to the territories which have been occupied in the Golan since 1967 and in southern Lebanon since 1982. Israel has to accept its responsibilities, withdraw from the occupied territories and share its water resources but, at the same time, it has to be sure that it will be safe and able to live in peace in terms of economic and political relations with all the countries in the area. However, Israel is not the only country concerned with security. The same goes for the other countries, especially for the Palestinians, who are still living under military occupation and whose land even today is still confiscated in areas B and C, despite the Oslo Agreement and subsequent agreements. Between the period when the Oslo Agreement was signed and 17 October 1999, 174 000 dunams of land were confiscated, 8 462 of which have been taken under Mr Barak’s Government. Trees have been uprooted, houses are still being demolished and, above all, water supplies have been reduced or refused, especially in East Jerusalem, while the settlements continue and are growing constantly. Nevertheless, there is no doubt that with the election of the new government, positive steps have been taken: negotiations, at least, have resumed. But in the Middle East, there can be no stable and lasting peace if the Palestinians do not have their own state, if they cannot move freely within their own territory. All the international community has to do is implement 
Resolutions 332, 248, 245 and 194.  We are concerned by the deferment of the building of relations with Syria, as well as Mr Barak’s decision to postpone the withdrawal of the Israeli army and the Sharm el­-Sheikh agreements. We feel it is extremely important for the European Union to play a political role in negotiations which matches its economic aid. We cannot be content with a role backstage. We must be leading protagonists while staying off a collision course with the United States, as Minister Gama said.

 Mr President, an extraordinary 21 year-old Afghan girl, who miraculously escaped from Taliban inhumanity and is now a refugee, together with hundreds of other women, told me when I was in Islamabad: "Now you are at the European Parliament, talk about us! Here, take this, it is my burka
. Show it to them, show the world this symbol and the reality of our denied existence, our imprisonment, our violated, dead and stoned bodies.” This is why today, speaking in this Parliament, I will wear this burka
 just for a moment. This is a gesture on behalf of all the women who have been killed, raped and denied their rights in Afghanistan and the world.  (Applause)
 The rights of women in Afghanistan are continually being violated. Women in Afghanistan and their cause 
need our solidarity and commitment. So we are asking Parliament, the Council, the Commission and the United Nations not to recognise the Taliban regime and to promote an action plan on behalf of the NGOs working in Afghanistan for the fundamental rights of Afghan women and their economic and social emancipation, and on behalf of the NGOs which help female Afghan refugees. However, there is something else we must do together: grant the right to asylum and aid to women who are forced to flee from Afghanistan.  (Applause)

 Commissioner, thank you for your reply. I also very much appreciate your statement on funding a plan to support Colombia, provided that the commitments that were made are met. Unfortunately, according to Human Rights Watch, some high-level military representatives, who are recognisable, whose names are known and who are responsible for military training and have been involved in various massacres, have still not been removed from their posts, while the terrible collusion 
between the military and paramilitary groups continues. I therefore think what Commissioner Patten said is important: these things must not be allowed to go unpunished and they must not be shrouded in silence. I am also very pleased to learn – and I confess my lack of knowledge on the subject – that there are plans, even important ones, regarding evacuees, humanitarian aid and committees on human rights. I wonder whether, in view of the peace talks, the Commission can massively increase the aid given to social movements in Colombia and to associations for human rights.

 Today, President Prodi told us that, so as not to sour Turkey’s attitude, its application to join the Union will be legitimised at Helsinki. This is a major step forwards, but it is a shame that Turkey has not taken any such positive steps. We are all indignant at the confirmation of the death sentence on President Öçalan, we are all united in asking for a gesture from the Turkish Government, and then there is the moratorium on capital punishment: it is likely that the sentence will be suspended, despite the government’s grave decision not to respond to the request from the Court in Strasbourg. Of course, this is not without importance, but is it enough to convince us that Turkey has its house in order so it can join the Union? No. Every day in Turkey human rights are violated: there are thousands of political prisoners, and union and religious freedoms, freedom of opinion and minorities’ freedoms are repressed. In the light of the extraordinary event and unilateral actions for peace, whereby the PKK chose to abandon the armed struggle and implement a ceasefire, and in the light of numerous leaders of the PKK choosing to turn themselves in to the Turkish authorities in order to reaffirm their choice of wishing to negotiate for peace, the Turkish Government gave only negative and scornful responses. Some young Kurdish refugees visiting the European Parliament asked us: will you help us return to our villages? They have been destroyed – will you help us rebuild them? As much as I welcome and am grateful for the content of the Morillon report, I think that we must send out a strong signal by postponing this decision until the Turkish Government confirms the stay of execution and begins talks to find a solution to the Kurdish question. There can be no double standards when it comes to the right to live.

 Mr President, we are all aware that in Seattle the stakes are high and of exceptional importance for the lives of the world’s citizens. It is not a question of technical matters that might concern groups of specialists from ministries of foreign trade. This is also evident from the fervour of the debate underway in Parliament, although it is still weak in decision-making power, but there have been new events in recent years that are taking supremacy away from the specialists. In Seattle, at the same time as the governmental meeting, thousands of NGOs will meet, thousands of men and women from civil society who are calling urgently for the WTO not to become one of the seats of that global government, based on the growth and supremacy of the most unbridled free trade, which does not take into account the growing poverty of the population of the least industrialised and weakest countries, the destruction of the environment, the protection of natural and human resources or the differences and diversities within each country, all in the name of globalisation, which is continuing to create wealth for a few and poverty for many.  It is an exceptional fact of democracy that thousands of men and women have debated together and demonstrated in favour of a different kind of economy, directly linked to daily life and democracy, because the fact that 134 governments are members of the WTO does not in itself guarantee transparency or democracy in decision-making processes because, over and above formal statutes, what really exists is the contractual power exercised by the strongest governments and multinationals. Because of these fundamental considerations, we do not agree with the Schwaiger report, although we acknowledge his thoroughness. We would like the European Parliament to adopt a clear, firm stand to the effect that the right to dignity, health, a home, freedom and the elimination of poverty is more important than free trade and profits. With regard to the United States’ frantic rush to defend its own interests, we of course recognise that Europe is maintaining a position concerned with the defence of more human traditions, but we do not feel this is enough: it is not enough to state high-sounding principles – we must put them into practice.  Many things in the Schwaiger report are positive: the defence of our agriculture, cultural diversity and more besides, but I will limit myself, because of time restrictions, to only mentioning some of the fundamental issues. The issue of agreements on intellectual property rights is very important. We agree with the NGOs and many countries which have suffered through these agreements that there should be a moratorium to renegotiate them. Just think of India, whose legislation does not provide for copyright on medicines or foodstuffs; yet India produces herbs that are used by multinationals and ourselves to treat illnesses; or Mandela’s South Africa, where, in retaliation for his attempt to make treatment for AIDS victims more accessible, the WTO imposed a withdrawal of cheaper medicines. We support the south African countries’ request not to negotiate whether plants and animals or human cells can be genetically modified and patented, which would take money from the weak and make multinationals bigger.  We also consider the precautionary principle and the principle of food safety fundamental, because we do not want to be overrun with genetically modified food, and we therefore think it necessary to reverse the burden of proof and we consider that the experts must really be independent of the interests of governments or multinationals. We want to safeguard workers’ rights, the right to strike, and apply codes of conduct that this Parliament… (The President cut the speaker off)

 Mr President, in voting against the Test Ban Treaty the American Senate has been irresponsible, and at the same time has become responsible for putting the world at serious risk of a nuclear holocaust. Senator Jesse James pompously said that the Treaty is dead and buried. He is known for his fundamentalism, but he did not realise, or perhaps he realised full well, that the signing of the Treaty was the first step towards the concrete realisation of the hope that what the United States did with the nuclear holocausts of Hiroshima and Nagasaki would never be repeated. What a sad prospect for our century! In fact, in the country which wishes to set itself up as a moral and strategic leader, groups seem to prevail which, for the sake of profits and military and nuclear supremacy, are not afraid of destroying themselves too. Actually, maybe we should not be surprised. These groups are the same ones which continue to inflict the death penalty and not pay the amounts due to the United Nations, thereby contributing to the loss of legitimacy and functionality of a structure which was founded on the principle of peoples’ right to be free from war.  What the Senate has done is sheer madness and, as Commissioner Patten was saying, it may not even have been done for strategic reasons but because of internal struggles, which makes the matter worse and even more shameful. Above all, as we have seen, this is encouraging other countries which already have nuclear capabilities, not to ratify the Treaty, and inciting even more countries to arm themselves with nuclear weapons. We have seen that Russia did not waste any time, and the day before yesterday it tested a Steel RS 18 intercontinental ballistic missile. What the Japanese Minister is doing is also worrying. And China, which has carried out 45 nuclear tests, had assured us it wanted ratification to be accelerated. Now all of these things are certainly in doubt.  Several times, Parliament has come out in favour of an end to nuclear weapons. We must work hard to ensure that those countries which have not yet ratified the Treaty do so as soon as possible. Here are just a few examples – China, Russia, India and Israel, which is still holding Mr Mordekaivanour as a conscientious objector in prison. We must also put a stop to Nuclear Sharing, as laid down in articles 1 and 2 of the Non-Proliferation Treaty, which states that no State in possession of nuclear weapons can, directly or indirectly, transfer weapons to another country. On the contrary, we have seen that large quantities of nuclear weapons have been brought to NATO bases, against the wishes of the local population who have chosen to live in nuclear-free areas. The European Union is certainly active in consolidating the path to the non-proliferation of nuclear weapons. I do not want to lose confidence that it is possible to make this world more rational, and that it will stop producing what could destroy it. I am convinced that peace movements against nuclear weapons, which achieved so much in the seventies and eighties, could take up their activities again in cooperation with us and our Parliament, so that we can truly live in a nuclear-free world.

Mr President, I am convinced that we must make the most of every opening and every chance of building peace through the assertion of the human, social and political rights of each individual or people. The situation in the Middle East is still a long way from this, but without doubt, the election of Ehud Barak as Prime Minister of Israel and the Palestinian’s peaceful choice have given peace a chance. This was shown by recent developments in the reworking of the Oslo Accord at Sharm el­Sheikh. But for peace, or at least possible justice to materialise, the Israeli authorities need to take more steps – some colleagues have already said this – not only because of the Palestinian-Israeli question, but also because of the Lebanese and Syrian question. The occupation of southern Lebanon must end and Syria’s land must be returned, as laid down in various UN resolutions. Of course, this is all in the interests of the security of the Israeli State. However, the security issue cannot hide the illegality of the military occupation or bombings of civilians, which happen in southern Lebanon, or the existence of prisons like those in Qian. But the Palestinian question is still at the heart of the matter.  In March 1999 in Berlin, the European Union reaffirmed the Palestinians’ right to a sovereign, democratic State that will peacefully co-exist with the Israeli State. In Sharm el­Sheikh, the conflicting parties undertook to lay down the final State by 2000. To achieve this, it is imperative that Israel realises that for the Palestinians, a sovereign state is not a generous concession but a right. Above all, Israel must not take any action that will change the territorial and demographic order of the occupied territories, including East Jerusalem. Still today, we hear news of Palestinian houses that have been demolished, confiscated land and the growth of colonial settlements. On 25 September, the military administration gave the go-ahead for the confiscation of Palestinian land belonging to 79 villages, in the Green Line area of cultivated and inhabited lands. The same happened in the village adjacent to Hebron. In East Jerusalem, men and women’s identity cards are confiscated to reduce their numbers in an operation that the centre for Israeli human rights has called ‘silent deportation’. Moreover, there is still the Palestinian refugees tragedy. Well, the UN resolution must be implemented. Of course, the opening of the corridor between Gaza and the West Bank is extremely positive, but Israeli checks make it difficult for men, women and goods to pass through. The European Union has a large part to play here. The European Union has played a positive and important role in the peace process in everything it has done and I think that it should continue to do so. In this sense, our role, the role that the European organisations are also performing, is essential.

 – Mr President, the era of peace and prosperity, to which Mr Arafat and Israeli leaders have referred to since 1993 following the Oslo Accord, is still not here. The revival of the peace process after the fall of Mr Netanyahu’s government, the election of Mr Barak and the new Accord signed in Sharm el-Sheikh undoubtedly mark a step forwards in respect to a dark past, after the assassination of Prime Minister Rabin. But there are still difficulties to overcome before stable and lasting peace can be achieved and before the Palestinians can live in a Palestinian State, as sanctioned in the UN Resolutions, that I hope will be democratic and will peacefully co-exist with the Israeli State. There are a lot of on-going problems. 70% of the West Bank and Gaza territory is still occupied by the army, the status of Jerusalem has not been established, there is the question of the Israeli settlements and the confiscation of land and water, more than 2,200 political prisoners are still incarcerated and there is the issue of the Palestinian refugees from the first exodus in 1948 and 1967 who amount to around four million. Without a positive response to these problems, peace will always be at risk. The European Union and, in particular, the European Parliament have always expressed their unconditional support for the attempts to help the Middle East peace process and to assist the Middle East. In the Resolution of March 1999 on the peace process and future aid for the Middle East, the European Parliament stressed with good reason that if the Wye Plantation Accords are confirmed – as they have been – the main problems must still be resolved, including in particular the status of the refugees. The Commission voted for the need for a steady and rigorous commitment to the refugees and accepted the tenth EC-UNRWA Convention which refers to 1999-2001. This has been submitted to the European Parliament and represents an important contribution. The proposed Convention, like the other nine signed after 1972, sets the EC’s contribution to the budget of the normal programmes of the Agency for the next three years, 1999 – 2001, and provides for annual talks on the EC’s contribution to the food aid budget. Naturally, the amount of food aid will be the subject of separate talks. UNRWA is asking for an overall contribution of EUR 120.82 million for the period up to 2001. Part of this contribution will be used for UNRWA’s educational programmes. Within the health programme, the majority will go towards the education programme. UNRWA’s regular programme aims to help 3,500,000 Palestinians in Jordan, Syria, Lebanon, the West Bank and the Gaza Strip. And as I said before, it provides aid to essential social sectors.  In order to take into account the development of the political situation in the region, Article 6 of the Convention lays down that, at the end of 2000, developments regarding refugees will be re-examined and possible UNRWA programmes concerning the Palestinian authorities gaining more power over their own affairs will also be evaluated. However, since the Palestinian authorities only control their own territory in the West Bank and Gaza, we must pay careful attention to UNRWA’s actions regarding the refugees who are still in Syria, Lebanon and Jordan and in all the countries where Palestinian refugees can be found. In these circumstances, I would like to emphasise once again that the refugee question is not only still unresolved but is now becoming worse, as I learnt from my recent visit to the Palestinian refugee camps in Lebanon, Jordan and Syria, from the various UNRWA reports and also from our colleague, Mr Menéndez del Valle, the European Union’s representative for humanitarian aid in Jordan. However, it is essential for this EC-UNRWA Convention to be adopted and implemented as soon as possible. This is particularly important, especially in view of the current crisis in which we are discussing UNRWA’s budget. Austerity measures have been introduced which suppress various appropriations for teachers, hospitals and medical equipment which has provoked, amongst other things, strong protests in the Palestinian refugee camps. One last matter – while underlining the need to continue providing humanitarian aid through UNRWA, I think that the European Parliament is particularly interested in finding a fair and balanced political solution to the Palestinian refugee problem. This solution must be in accordance with UN Resolution 194. In this respect, I think that the greatest efforts must be made to invite the authorities concerned in the region, especially the Israeli and Palestinian authorities, to contribute to this solution. Just two more points: the Committee on Budgetary Control has proposed two amendments on greater transparency, which we subscribe to, and finally, there is a legal question of the way in which our vote is requested by the Commission, and this is something which we will have to examine.

– First of all, I apologise to the President for not having stood up sooner, but I did not realise. I will not do it again. I certainly do not want to show disrespect to the House. However, I am afraid I have made another mistake, by speaking too quickly. So I apologise to the people who work so hard for us, the interpreters, because one of my colleagues told me that I was speaking too quickly. I was emotional but I think that as I am a woman and emotion and reason go hand in hand, next time I will use reason more. However, I would simply like to say that I am extremely pleased with the interventions that my colleagues have made because something has emerged very clearly. Despite the need to carry out this programme quickly, the important point is for the European Union and the European Parliament to play a stronger, more active role so that in the Middle East, stable and lasting peace will come about, especially between Palestine and Israel. This will allow us to find a solution to the refugee question and enable a Palestinian State to live peacefully with the Israeli State too.

 Mr President, between the devil of Milosevic and the deep blue sea of NATO: this is the feeling of most of the Serbian democratic opposition to Milosevic. Between the violence of Serbian paramilitary forces, the intimidation and violence of the KLA and NATO bombs falling from the sky: this is the sentiment of those Kosovo Albanian troops who chose to fight for their rights without resorting to violence. Against the NATO bombings and against nationalism and the homicidal and suicidal politics of Milosevic: this is the feeling of millions and millions of European men and women who hold the respect of human rights to be fundamental, wherever they have been violated: in Kosovo, Kurdistan, Palestine or Iran. These are the democratic, peaceful forces which should have been supported by the international community. Obviously, Milosevic had and has to be stopped, as the KLA had and has to be stopped, each responsible in different ways. Now, after NATO has destroyed and laid waste in the name of the defence of human rights, we must rebuild. We hope and wish to act in this Parliament so that construction takes place in such a way that human resources and the dignity of each side involved in the conflict are respected and valued during the process, and that colonisation by Europe or the United States World Bank is avoided. Kosovo must be reconstructed with its present and past inhabitants – both Albanian and Serbian – as protagonists. At the same time, Serbia and Montenegro and the infrastructures laid to waste and destroyed by air raids, must be rebuilt, and the damage to the environment investigated and remedied. The reconstruction of Kosovo must focus not only on the economy and trade, but also on the social, civil and democratic fabric. To achieve this, reconstruction must be carried out through the involvement of local communities, with exchanges between municipalities, universities, men and women of the European Union, Kosovo and the Republic of Yugoslavia. For the war to be truly erased from the picture, we must bring about reconciliation, create societies and build democracy. This is our challenge.
