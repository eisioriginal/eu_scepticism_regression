 Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I consider that Italy has no wish whatsoever to abide by what are European laws. This is borne out by the fact that it was the only country whose government, with a green environment minister, abstained from the approval in Council of the common position on the recent waste directive. I should like to ask a question, because over and above the disaster of a green minister who is utterly irresponsible and lacks any certainty about his actions, there has also been little interest in monitoring by the European Commission, because we received funds in 2000-2006 and the Regional Operational Programmes in Campania have obviously been implemented without the monitoring committee carrying out its tasks in full, otherwise it would have blocked funds which had had no effective impact in the area. Perhaps it is unnecessary to point out who was President of the European Commission at that time and who is now Prime Minister of Italy, with a green minister?

 Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, I gave a definite ‘no’ to a document further impaired by the adoption of various amendments which have made it worse, and in particular because of the introduction of sugaring which we had managed to stave off for years, taking the view that sugaring is no more than a way of making up for nature. The majority of this House rejected must aid which, even though it is no more than a financial measure, would nevertheless have mitigated the damage brought about by allowing sugaring. This is a victory for the countries of the North and a defeat for the countries of the Mediterranean area which have been unable to defend the highly vocational nature of their territories. This CMO is detrimental to the quality and the typical and genuine nature of products, and damaging for wine growers, producers and consumers.

 Madam President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, strengthening the neighbourhood policy with the South must be a strategic priority. The Barcelona process has marked a significant stage in our relations with the Mediterranean countries and it continues to do so. Pessimists will tell us that the results have not come up to expectations, that South-South economic cooperation is still only incipient, and that we are still a long way from achieving any substantial results on the joint management of immigration front. We could of course have done a lot more, but we certainly would not have achieved what we have achieved without the Barcelona conference and without the process that came after it. What was achieved was in-depth political dialogue between the two sides on a broad range of subjects. This is demonstrated by the frequent Euro-Mediterranean Councils of Ministers and the conclusion of a series of bilateral association agreements between the European Union and its partners, which may be seen as a basis for developing more comprehensive economic integration. The new neighbourhood policy provides instruments for closer cooperation in the Mediterranean region. The action plans enable us to make our actions more specific and to tailor them more to each partner's needs. These plans, however, must not be an alternative to the Barcelona process, but additional instruments that should make it possible to implement and achieve the Barcelona objectives more effectively. These are common issues that change over time and as new needs arise, and they require a common approach in the interests of all the stakeholders in the region. They include the prospect of gradually integrating the Euro-Mediterranean energy markets in order to carry out joint energy programmes and to develop sustainable sources of energy, within a framework of active cooperation that is also aimed at ensuring the security of energy supplies, the diversification of these energy sources, the promotion of energy efficiency, the development of new technologies, research programmes, and the development of joint projects in this field. One result of all that has been deeper mutual understanding, which should lead to broader, more open contact and a chance to correct any mistakes that have been made, so that stability, peace, democracy and progress may be the outcome for us all to share.

Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, on the eve of the vote on the report concerning the labelling of foods, I am pleased to inform the House that, following intense negotiations, we have arrived at a common text that I hope will enable us to avoid the conciliation procedure. Before going into detail, I should like to thank the shadow rapporteurs from the other groups, Mrs Sommer, Mrs Corbey, Mr Maaten, Mrs Evans, Mrs Breyer, Mrs Liotard and Mr Blokland, for their decisive contributions and for their willingness to negotiate, even in the most trying times. In a state of deadlock, in which the Council did not seem willing to grant us anything further, we succeeded in putting a compromise package together: a final text that, bolstered by the support of all the parliamentary groups, prompted the Council to accept the proposals on the table. All that remains is for tomorrow’s vote to put the seal on matters and, in that regard, I call on all of my fellow Members to support the compromise with the aim of reaching the qualified majority that we need to amend the common position. I believe that, overall, this is a balanced text that effectively pursues the objective of guaranteeing consumers accurate, clear and understandable information, so as to enable them to make a balanced and informed choice about their diet. Everyone in this House agrees on the need to promote a healthy and balanced diet for Europeans, and to prevent a situation in which a tempting label promising extraordinary benefits for a person’s figure or, worse still, for his or her health, in reality disguises a high-calorie foodstuff, without the consumer having the opportunity to identify it as such. In a Europe in which, according to the WHO, one in five children is obese, and in the light of the recent studies demonstrating the link between advertising and junk food consumption, this regulatory measure can no longer be postponed. I believe that the primary objective of consumer protection has been fully achieved in the text resulting from the compromise. I should like to add that, through Parliament’s intervention, we have succeeded in following up and responding to the requests for clarity and definite timescales that were worrying the food industry. This compromise has not been easy, partly because the Council’s position on some points remained very inflexible – practically rigid – until the end of the negotiations. That is precisely why I regard it as a great success that we have won concessions on these very points: I refer, in particular, to Article 4 and to the measures relating to alcohol that we will address later on. I should, however, like to point out straight away that the agreement with the Council relates to a package that must be supported in toto.
 I therefore call on you straight away to reject Amendments 90 and 49, which fall outside the package agreed on with the other European institutions. As for the placing on the market of so-called 'health' labels, the Council has agreed to introduce a simplified and faster procedure that will guarantee our businesses more certainty. Ever since we cast our unanimous vote in the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Food Safety, it has been clear that shortening the timescale should not mean sacrificing a thorough scientific assessment of the authenticity of the claims made on labels. The European Food Safety Authority (EFSA) should have exactly the same amount of time to assess claims under both procedures. The Council has supported us in this proposal and the final outcome is that Parliament has succeeded in ensuring that health labels presenting no particular problems will be able to receive a definitive marketing authorisation in eight months. On the other hand, the simplified procedure will not apply to some labels that are particularly dangerous insofar as they are very appealing, such as those that boast of being effective in reducing health risks and those that refer to children’s development. Those labels will instead have to be subject to the full authorisation procedure that will guarantee greater control, not only in scientific terms on the part of EFSA and the Commission, but also on the part of the Member States in the context of the comitology procedure. As regards the controversial subject of nutrient profiles, or the notorious Article 4, I should like to point out that, until last Wednesday, the Council was against any derogation from the text. In essence, the common position stipulated that no type of labelling – neither nutrition nor health labelling – could be used on a product that did not comply with the nutrient profiles established by EFSA. For example, a sweet with a high sugar content could never bear a health or nutrition claim. The compromise text accepted by all of the groups and the Council now provides for the option to affix labels containing nutritional information even when a substance exceeds the nutrient profile, provided that a statement is added on the same side of the packaging to warn the consumer of the high levels of the substance exceeding the nutrient profiles. In that way, the consumer is guaranteed accurate information, which can be seen at a glance on the same side of the packaging, while, at the same time, the food industry is given the opportunity to use this type of claim. I regard this text as a victory for Parliament on a point that the Council had initially thought untouchable. In relation to brands, we have succeeded in ensuring that existing brands can continue to be used for 15 years without any further requirements. Once that period has expired, they may continue to be used provided that they are accompanied by a corresponding claim that complies with the provisions of the present regulation. I believe that this is a sufficiently long transitional period for the industry, enough, at any rate, to enable it to adapt to the Community regulations. Furthermore, we have safeguarded the use of generic names that traditionally accompany food products such as ‘aperitif’, ‘digestive’ and ‘cough sweets’: those terms will be granted special exemptions and may be readily used. I would also point out to the House that all the systems of negative labelling, the so-called ‘traffic light’ or ‘red stamp’ systems, which are already in use in some countries, remain outside the scope of the regulation and will therefore be regulated at national level. In our role as Parliament, we have won some important victories in the negotiations concerning the protection of SMEs. What we had initially been told was impossible on technical grounds has instead been granted to us. Two recitals highlight the importance of making it easier for SMEs to use the labels, insofar as they represent ‘important added value for the European food industry’. Under the new Article 15, the Commission will have to commit itself to making instruments and guidelines available to SMEs in order to make it easier, in particular, to apply the present regulation. Furthermore, by reducing the data protection period to five years, compared with the seven planned initially, we have shortened the waiting times for claims to be used by those small and medium-sized enterprises that do not have the financial resources needed to fund their own research into labels. Thanks to Parliament’s amendment, SMEs will soon be able to use all of the labels that have already been authorised and that are available in the list provided for in Article 13. They can be used free of charge and without any formalities. Those who do not have the financial means to fund research into a claim will therefore also be able to use it easily and at no extra cost. As regards the protection of children – a matter of great importance in this House – we have succeeded in ensuring that all labels that refer to children’s development or improved health are assessed under the full authorisation procedure, so as to ensure that thorough checks are carried out, including by the Member States, on whether the label is scientifically valid and whether it can be understood by the consumer. Claims made by medical, dieticians’ and nutritionists’ associations will be accepted, but not those made by individual doctors. As regards alcohol, nutrition labels had already been accepted in the common position. Beverages containing more than 1.2% by volume of alcohol were authorised to bear labels marked ‘reduced alcohol content’ or ‘fewer calories’. As a further, albeit final, offer, the Council has also allowed the use of the wording 'low alcohol content'. We have also obtained significant recognition of the importance of safeguarding the variety of culinary traditions, as well as the possibility for those who sell foods loose to receive special conditions. To conclude, I call on you all to support the amendments forming part of the compromise signed by all of the groups, and those amendments alone, so that the legislative process for this report – which has been so controversial that it has remained before this House for more than three years – may be brought to a successful conclusion. I should like to express my heartfelt thanks to everyone, including my colleagues from the groups and the support staff.

Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, I would like first of all to thank the rapporteur for her hard work on this report, and also the Commissioner, for the words of hope she offered on this tormented area of the Mediterranean. In 1995, an irreversible process was begun in Barcelona, which aimed at closer cooperation between countries in the Mediterranean area. Pessimists will tell us that the results have been below expectations, that economic progress in southern Mediterranean countries has been insufficient, that political dialogue has been difficult and fragmented, that Europe has not been able to make itself heard properly with regard to human rights and democracy, that South-South economic cooperation is still in its infancy, and that results have not been satisfactory in terms of joint management of immigration. The international geopolitical landscape of today’s Mediterranean has certainly changed, and the ambitious project of the Barcelona Process must therefore be modified and adapted to this new international context if the Euro-Mediterranean Partnership is to meet the current challenges. Let us begin, however, with what has been done. We have set up joint inter-ministerial cooperation mechanisms – which will receive no further debate – for the common resolution of problems in that particular area. We have established a Euro-Mediterranean Parliamentary Assembly to supplement governmental cooperation, in which we work together under parliamentary rules. We have initiated a support programme worth EUR 700 million a year – MEDA – in order to channel resources and development between north and south, which today has achieved some quite attractive rates of implementation. We have set in motion the democratic process, which has started anyway, in coastal countries such as Lebanon, Egypt and, to a certain extent, Palestine. Association agreements have been signed between the European Union and all the southern Mediterranean countries, and there have of course been plenty of examples of cooperation, seemingly minor but very effective on a cultural level, which were all initiated within the wider framework of the Barcelona Agreement. All that has allowed us to understand one another better, whilst opening the door with a certain optimism to a second decade, when we must consolidate the positive aspects of the process, make more concrete our objectives and current planning, and correct any mistakes made, so that stability, peace, democracy and socio-economic progress may be results shared by an ever greater number of countries and citizens in the Mediterranean area. One final point I wish to raise is the issue of culture, which is not only about education and training, but also about cultural heritage. If we safeguard our cultural heritage we can understand and respect each another better within the context of our own identities and diversity.

Mr President, although I have not requested to speak, I should like to point out to Members the possible reintroduction of Article 4, which reinstates the nutrient profiles that the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Food Safety in contrast decided to scrap. I strongly recommend the approval of this amendment insofar as it serves to restore meaning to the regulation as a whole.

Madam President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, the Commission’s proposal on nutrition and health claims has arisen from the possibility of building on the consumer’s growing interest in receiving clear information on the nutritional and health value of foods, and from the need for the food industry to respond to this urgent request with clear, accurate and significant information, which is substantiated scientifically. All of this should take place within a framework of harmonised market regulations, in order to enable food business operators to be competitive according to fair and equitable regulatory criteria. Healthy food and good health go hand in hand as benchmarks for the behaviour of consumers, who have a much greater awareness of their diet these days and who are increasingly concerned to know what they are eating and to understand how food products impact on their health. This is the behaviour of the average consumer, and the food industry has attempted to respond to this behaviour by means of more detailed nutritional labelling, providing claims on the positive benefits, or alleged benefits, of some foods. It is a fact that the two basic EU directives in force – Directives 2000/13 and 90/496, relating to the labelling and nutrition labelling of foodstuffs respectively – are not only inadequately enforced in the majority of cases, but they also respond poorly to the present–
day demands of consumers, since they do not allow any data to be given on the alleged health benefits, and they do not clearly define the conditions of use of the nutrition claims. The absence of specific provisions at European level has given rise, moreover, to a real proliferation of claims on the labels of food products – claims varying in number and type. The Member States have adopted independent provisions and standards to regulate the use of the various claims. This results in a regulatory mess, with different approaches to the same subject–
matter, which has given rise to a state of confusion that leads to neither the effective running of the internal market, nor the safeguarding of public health and consumer health. Faced with such legal uncertainty, there is a need to harmonise the regulations relating to foodstuffs at Community level and, therefore, a need for a regulation which, without banning any foods, will clearly set out the fundamental conditions to ensure that the claims on foodstuffs are completely accurate for consumers. That is one further step forwards in implementing the nutrition policy included in the objectives proposed by the Commission in 1999 with the White Paper on food safety. In this White Paper it is expressly stated that the Union’s food policy should be built around strict food safety standards that protect and promote the health of the consumer. To these objectives must be added that of increasing the free movement of food products, in that the creation of a regulation will enable food business operators to be competitive on a fair and equal footing throughout the Member States. With the document that we are studying, the Commission has proposed the introduction of a new regulatory framework for nutrition and health claims, authorising the use of nutrition claims provided that they comply with the provisions set out in the annex, 
which contains a list of nutrition claims and specific conditions for the use thereof: 
the use of health claims will be subject to an authorisation or notification procedure (if the Commission’s text were to remain unchanged). Through the procedures laid down by Article 93(2), the Commission proposes to draw up specific nutrient profiles for foods or categories of foods within a period of 18 months, which could rise to as much as 30 months, and, subject to consultation of the Food Safety Agency, specific nutrient profiles for foods or categories of foods, and the adoption of a Community list of health claims which describe the generally accepted role of a nutrient or other substances on the basis of proposals submitted by the Member States. In setting the nutrient profiles, the Commission will consult both food business operators and consumer groups, in addition to the Agency, which will see its role strengthened as a result of its involvement in the various stages and procedures. It must be acknowledged, at this stage, that the two years that have passed since the presentation have not been in vain, since all the interested parties – the Commission itself, the Council, Parliament, industry, consumers and the Economic and Social Committee – have recorded significant progress. The Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Food Safety has made many amendments to the Commission’s text, however, in particular by removing Article 4, which, in my opinion, is an extremely important article because it sets out the nutrient profiles. The coherence and complexity of the regulation would, moreover, be of truly little significance if this article were not reintroduced. It is an article that I hope my fellow Members will wish to reintroduce.

 Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, ten years ago in Barcelona, the European Union and its neighbours in the Mediterranean region launched an ambitious programme which sought to create an area of stability, peace and economic progress in the region by means of closer, mutual understanding. We have not managed to achieve everything and must relaunch the whole process more effectively. This year, 2005, could be our opportunity. Above all, we wanted an area of lasting peace, and these ten years have unfortunately been more difficult than the previous ones in terms of relations between the Palestinians and the Israelis, whose conflict has in some ways affected the stability of the Euro-Mediterranean area. Today, however, tangible facts appear to show that it is possible to overcome misunderstandings and tensions and resolve the ten-year-long conflict in that area. On the other hand, we must mention a positive accomplishment: the launch of the Anna Lindh Foundation, based in Alexandria in Egypt. We expect it to play a major part in boosting cultural exchanges between all countries in the Euro-Mediterranean area, and in the growth of a dynamic civil society which is as pluralist as possible in those countries which are still lagging behind. The Commission could and should consider links between the Foundation and other more minor Euro-Mediterranean satellite cultural centres located throughout the area, which can equally spread the same messages of friendship, mutual understanding and peace among the peoples of the Euro-Mediterranean region, and which serve as cultural, research and training centres, including for the many immigrants in that area. In short, we wish to obtain the necessary impetus from the ups and downs of these first ten years in order to look ahead with renewed confidence.

 Mr President, representatives of the Commission and the Council, ladies and gentlemen, today all the concerns already raised during the parliamentary debate in January 2004 are being voiced again, but above all the emphasis is on the inadequacy of the measures recommended by the Prodi Commission with regard to the crisis in the textile and clothing sector, which have already been weighing down industry in this sector for some years, causing the loss of thousands of jobs. We only have to cast our minds back to the unwillingness to address the issue with specific programmes. We hope that there will now be other guidelines. The High Level Group and the Commission have proposed seven actions to help the textile industry boost competitiveness in the sector: they are all important, but I would give particular emphasis to one of these. In Europe we have labour legislation with especially strong worker protection which vastly inflates the cost of goods. We cannot tolerate unfair competition from certain non-EU countries based precisely on extremely low labour costs and in particular, the exploitation of child labour. Along with the call to tighten corporate social responsibility, we will have to make the public more aware of ethical purchases, through special campaigns. To this end, labelling which allows consumers to easily identify goods manufactured in accordance with the fundamental labour rights specified by the International Labour Organisation is vital in order for buyers to take responsibility too. Together with actions in the fight against counterfeiting, I would highlight the suggestion to take action to support traditional textiles with focused programmes, not least so that we can avoid further official approval of textile goods, which is certainly of little use in the context of celebrating regional identities.

Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, in congratulating Mr Wiersma on the quality and comprehensive nature of his report, I wish to emphasise on behalf of the Union for Europe of the Nations Group the importance that this European Union military peacekeeping mission assumes in the extremely sensitive area of Bosnia-Herzegovina. This is a first for the Union; apart from the symbolic fact that it will allow the 7 000 soldiers already serving under the aegis of NATO now to wear the 12-star symbol on the sleeves of their uniforms, the mission does, in any event, mean a greater European presence and hence greater visibility for the Union in the Balkans. In the nineties, when bloody ethnic conflicts broke out one after the other in the region, people used to wonder where Europe was, and it was distressing that we were so absent. Today, however, we are witnessing a presence and attention on the part of our institutions that befits the circumstances. The 7 000 soldiers will arrive in Bosnia in a strong position, and their strength derives not so much from their weapons as from their expertise, their humanity, and their willingness towards the local population. The people are mindful of the need for a military presence on their territory in this delicate phase of stabilising their country, and are therefore ready to welcome them warmly. These soldiers are not arriving alone in unknown territory. With them in Bosnia there are the institutions, the Commission, the High Representative of the Union, who for two and a half years has been working as a truly enlightened governor in Bosnia, in a far-from-easy attempt to ensure the establishment of the rule of law within a renewed framework of peaceful co-existence between the three major ethnic groups in the country. Parliament, through its delegation led by its indefatigable chairman, Mrs Pack, closely follows events in Bosnia, as shown, among other things, by the recent visit to that country. This visit brought home to members of the Bosnia-Herzegovina Parliament the principles and routes through which they could have a closer relationship with the European Union. Today the perspective is that of a stabilisation and association agreement and tomorrow, at a time we cannot yet foresee, the prospect of future accession. We should not allow ourselves to be deceived by all this, however. Important steps have been taken in Bosnia on the path to stabilisation. The desire for normalisation is palpable in many areas of the country and the wish to forget the past and to think of the future is shared by all its inhabitants. Of the sixteen points set out in the feasibility study, many have already been translated into law. It is fitting and heartening to note this, but there is still much to do. The military peacekeeping mission under the aegis of the Union from 2 December is there for this purpose.

Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, my compliments to President Florenz. In calling him president, I do so out of esteem and consideration for the commitment he has always shown to our Parliament. In adopting the climate and energy package, the European Union has equipped itself with a legislative framework that gives it the right credentials to take a leading role. The recent open-mindedness shown by the new US administration gives us cause to hope for a future shared commitment with the United States to halt the consequences of climate change. However, the full success of the initiative will be determined by the involvement of the economies of all the developing countries, such as China and India. As the Chinese environment minister made clear when he met with the delegation from the Temporary Committee on Climate Change, this will only be possible with firm support from the richer countries in the form of adequate financial resources to encourage sustainable development. Progress has been made in this area with the Poznań conference and the decision to put the adjustment fund into operation, as well as the EUR 50 million for research and technological development allocated to developing countries to support the evolution of green technologies at global level. We must ensure that Copenhagen marks a turning point in terms of practical joint commitment by stronger economies to create a fund that will guarantee a continual flow of funding for sustainable development in emerging countries. Only through commitments agreed at international level with the involvement of emerging countries will we succeed in safeguarding the environment from irreversible effects, while at the same time protecting the competitiveness of European businesses from the effects and socio-economic costs of environmental dumping on the world market.

 Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I would like to thank the rapporteur, Mr Sacconi, for his excellent work on the compromise, which was reached with decision, determination and, indeed, endurance. The report on the reduction of CO2
 emissions from light vehicles has added an important detail: the fight against climate change. For the first time, in fact, we have regulated CO2
 emissions from passenger vehicles by imposing an ambitious and binding long-term target of 95 grams of CO2
 per kilometre by 2020, at a time when the serious financial crisis and the subsidies given to the motor industry in non-EU countries are, together, severely testing our own industry. We have successfully fought to include a reduction in the penalties for slight deviations from the set targets. We believe that the method the Commission has chosen to determine the reduction targets, based on the kerb weight of the average car, is questionable and unjustified from an environmental point of view. Indeed, a provision of this kind leads to a paradoxical situation in which vehicles that are lighter and smaller, and therefore less polluting, are in fact penalised. Nonetheless I believe and hope that, once appropriately balanced, the text will be able to give great impetus to a targeted effort. For these reasons I see the report on the reduction of vehicle CO2
 emissions as a significant result and I am therefore in favour of its adoption.

 Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, the new 20/20/20 formula used to sum up Europe’s targets to combat climate change, is an ambitious commitment which would make Europe the undeniable leader in this global battle. To be honest, I should highlight the difference between the universal nature of this target and the unilateral approach of Europe’s obligations. In my opinion, we should be bold enough to admit that this demonstration of our ability could prove to be, at the same time, of no use for the environment and crippling for our industry, if it is not considered in multilateral negotiations. Obviously, we all support the aim of protecting the environment, but in order to do this, we have to identify the most effective instruments, which enjoy broad support. It is essential that these two conditions be combined, as having one without the other would frustrate all our efforts and could even have irreparable consequences for our industry. A cost-benefits analysis is, therefore, fundamental. I would stress that an approach of this kind in no way means gauging or questioning the importance of safeguarding the planet; I simply believe that the instruments which comprise the climate and energy package, first and foremost revision of the ETS directive, must be carefully evaluated, including in terms of the economic or bureaucratic burdens on our businesses and the public purse, as well as in terms of the competitiveness of European manufacturing, with special emphasis on small and medium-sized enterprises. This line of reasoning is legitimate, especially at a time when the global economy is hostage to a poor economic climate, calling for a fresh analysis of the philosophy of the package: I am referring to a review of the criteria used to calculate the national targets. Above all, it is imperative to take full advantage of the so-called flexibility mechanisms and only then can we hope to remain competitive at global level. I will conclude by stressing that, at this time, it is more vital than ever to avoid attempts to exploit divisions between defenders of industry and champions of the environment.

 Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I would like to express my support for this report, which is perfectly in line with the commitment to better regulation that Europe has stood for for many years. The new system of marketing authorisations for medicinal products will considerably simplify the procedure in the case of minor changes or new scientific discoveries and will signify a substantial easing of the technical and administrative burden on businesses. All of this is fully in keeping with the goals set out in the Lisbon strategy launched by the European institutions at the dawn of the new millennium. It identifies better regulation as one of the pillars underpinning the growth of the economy and jobs in Europe. It cannot be denied that the competitiveness of our businesses is suffering under the excessive legislative and bureaucratic conditions on manufacturing that have accumulated in recent decades, and that the impact of this is becoming ever more burdensome and unsustainable in the case of small and medium-sized enterprises that form the backbone of the national production system in many Member States. More to the point, at this precise moment in time, when the international crisis is threatening to suffocate our economy, we cannot allow ourselves to put our businesses at a further disadvantage with wasted costs and administrative delays. The will to streamline the legislative framework must be perceived as a duty and an unbreakable commitment. I am pleased that the Council, too, has accepted the European Parliament’s request to protect small and medium-sized enterprises by excluding from the scope authorisations for pharmaceuticals issued by Member States up to 1998. This has prevented small and medium-sized enterprises from having to make further efforts in order to comply with current legislation.

 Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, before opening the debate about the report on which we will be voting tomorrow, I should like to take this opportunity to say some words of thanks. I would begin by thanking my colleague Adriana Poli Bortone, now a senator of the Italian Republic, from whom I inherited the draft report and an already detailed, meticulous study of the topic; next my staff, who have supported me enthusiastically and conscientiously in furthering my exploration and analysis of the phenomenon; and finally the shadow rapporteurs, whose commitment undoubtedly contributed to the adoption of the text in the Committee on the Environment, with a virtually unanimous cross-party consensus. Ladies and gentlemen, when this draft text was entrusted to me, I asked myself what my aim should be as rapporteur in carrying forward a study of this kind. I found an answer in the strategic nature of the document, which showed me the two pillars on which I came to base my work: firstly completeness, so as not to leave any gaps or underestimate the importance of any of the numerous aspects of the subject in hand; and practicality, so as to be able to draw up a genuinely future-oriented document identifying effective instruments and solutions. In adopting this approach I relied on the data, statistics and percentages already widely available on the topic. The percentages are discomfiting once we look into them since, according to the World Health Organisation, more than 1 billion people are overweight and over 300 million are obese. Child obesity is growing rapidly, and we should bear in mind that diseases related to obesity and overweight absorb up to 6% of national health expenditure in certain Member States. In seeking possible solutions we took care not to demonise certain types of food as being solely responsible for the problem of obesity. The problem will not be solved by eliminating such foods from our diet, but rather by educating consumers, and especially young people and children, to eat sensibly. Fats are an essential part of a correct nutritional intake, but in the right quantities and at the right times of the day. Lessons on diet, on which I lay great emphasis, are not about the ability to distinguish good foods from bad; nothing is harmful in absolute terms, and nothing needs to be excluded from the diet of healthy people not suffering from an eating disorder. Another issue to which I would draw your attention is that obesity certainly does constitute a disease. It is a disease whose causes are not only physical but often social or psychological, but it nevertheless remains a disease which costs our national health systems huge sums of money every year. It is a disease which, as such, must be tackled by means of practical, multi-layered solutions. During these months of study, however, I have realised that all too often this aspect is underestimated by public opinion, which indulges in wholly justified alarmism and awareness-raising campaigns about anorexia but also takes an equally un
justified consolatory approach towards overweight, with slogans such as ‘big is beautiful’, and so on. This is misguided; it sends out the wrong message. We are not discussing aesthetics or appearance; we are talking about health. Therefore, just as the scourge of anorexia needs to be fought energetically, we wish to try and combat obesity in the same manner, working on the various fronts set out in this report, which calls for parallel and consistent efforts. Efforts are required from educators, health professionals, the food industry and the media, especially television. All of them must exercise the strong sense of responsibility deriving from their potential to guide public opinion. Public authorities, especially local ones, must play their part too. I wish to close, ladies and gentlemen, with a news item which has made waves in the past few days: namely, one of the two candidates in the race for the White House has stated that it would be useful, right and proper to tax obese citizens as well as alcoholics and smokers. This, in my opinion, is absurd as a principle, but I do believe that this serious problem must be addressed in an appropriate manner, because only by tackling it head-on will positive results be achieved.

 Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I should like to emphasise one aspect of the Commissioner’s statement which I consider very important. Close attention should be paid to an issue that deserves serious consideration while we endeavour at the same time to create new opportunities. This subject is, I believe, one that concerns many of us, since several well-focused speeches have explored it and sought to spur the Commission into action. Above all, however, the report itself aims to make clear that we are dealing with a highly critical condition: obesity. As far as health problems are concerned, obesity is now becoming an extremely complex problem that has to be solved. Help must be provided and we must produce a report which helps us to achieve our objectives. Commissioner, the Commission has indeed underscored the role of the World Health Organisation, but let us not forget that the WHO itself is calling for the trend of rising child obesity to be reversed by 2015. Another important date will be 2010, which is when we will be in a position to judge the outcome of this strategy. I should therefore like to thank all those who have spoken in the debate and the shadow rapporteurs. I am grateful for all the suggestions made and believe that we must be very alert and careful to draw up a significant report which will really enable us to think in terms of prevention and well-balanced healthy eating, for the sake not only of the body but also the mind and soul. I believe that we certainly can attain this goal thanks to everyone’s cooperation. Once again, my thanks go to all those who have spoken in favour of this report. Thank you, Commissioner.

 Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, I would like to congratulate the rapporteur, Mrs Sartori, together with her shadow rapporteurs and the Council and the Commission for reaching an agreement on the GHS package at first reading. We have managed to achieve the target that had been set for us, which was to get the new system up and running quickly and in line with the REACH Regulation, while at the same time ensuring a high level of protection of human health and the environment, as well as meeting the commercial needs of firms, which can now target foreign markets more easily. Once the GHS is in operation, firms will be able to operate based on a single classification system for substances, harmonised at international level, and which, among other things, will allow easier access to legislation on substances via the European Chemicals Agency. With this regulation, which applies international criteria for the classification and labelling of hazardous substances and mixtures in the European Union, we will ensure that our firms are ready to open up to the global market. There will also undoubtedly be benefits for the consumer, who will be able to recognise hazardous substances such as toxic and corrosive substances and irritants more easily. The GHS labelling system, with its uniform pictograms, that are easy to understand, will help identify the risks of substances contained in everyday products such as detergents and soaps. In addition, the GHS, which for many substances requires special safety devices to seal packaging, will help protect our children from dangerous accidents in the home due to the accidental ingestion of toxic or corrosive substances. Of course, the GHS will require a certain amount of effort from firms, particularly small and medium-sized enterprises, which should have confidence in the new system. The system will in fact introduce seven new risk categories and a new classification for the transport system. This is why we are particularly pleased with the agreement reached with the Council, which also took into account the support, information and running-in requirements, particularly for SMEs. The agreement also took account of the consensus of all parliamentary groups on the need to minimise animal testing and any duplication of these tests as far as possible. For all of these reasons, my group will be voting in favour of the package tabled.

 Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I should like to thank Mrs Ferreira for her excellent work. Taking global responsibility to combat climate change is a crucial task that has to be achieved at various levels: not just in the world of enterprises and institutions, but among individuals as well. As European citizens, we can substantially reduce our ecological footprint and achieve major results simply by means of small measures, including our purchasing choices, that can have a global and significant impact. The Member States can encourage, or make it easier for, people to choose ecological products through market-based instruments. As well as promoting research into new technologies it is important to ensure that these technologies are made available to consumers and disseminated widely enough to bring about environmental benefits for the community. It is a pity that 16 countries representing the planet’s largest economies, meeting in Paris on 16 and 18 April, did not manage to reach agreement on a joint resolution aiming to cut global greenhouse gas emissions by 50% by 2050. However, we are hopeful that the subsequent negotiations in Kobe and Hokkaido will lead to more success in this area, especially as I believe that climate change has to be combated at a global level; otherwise, it will merely place a heavy burden on European enterprises causing them to become less competitive than their rivals from outside Europe without achieving the aim of an environmental improvement at global level. We have to use market-based instruments as economic levers if we are to move towards environmentally friendly production systems that are sustainable in the long term; in that respect, I welcome the Commission’s Green Paper. The European Union has to foster the dissemination in the Member States of market-based instruments that make it possible to internalise the environmental costs of products and to promote energy efficiency and the thermal insulation of buildings. I consider that it is essential for the European Union to achieve the goal of 20% of consumption from renewable sources by 2020.

Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, the Commission has changed tack on two counts as concerns the energy and climate package, which unfortunately we know little about: keeping to the Kyoto pledges, and improving Europe's energy mix and supply. We particularly welcome the commitments to promoting the spread of renewable energies, greater flexibility in the authorisation of State aid for environmental actions, and the development of clean sources and technologies to curb emissions. However, the package contains some sensitive issues relating to the competitiveness of our firms. Mr Barroso himself has estimated the cost at some €60 billion. We will have to look at the impact of this burden. The plan for a system of auctioning quotas, estimated to cost around €39 per tonne of CO2, and for its extension to the transport and building sectors, is causing industry quite some concern and will probably affect final consumers. Given these gloomy forecasts, the Commission and especially the Member States will have to do their utmost to reduce the economic and social impact of the measures. I would stress that Europe's role as world leader in the struggle against climate change is unquestioned and unquestionable. We must bear in mind, however, that our international competitors in many cutting-edge sectors of the economy take the opposite view. To conclude, I agree with what President Barroso has said. We certainly must work hard to determine commitments and outcomes and give greater weight to the package presented to us. The package must not remain virtual but must be fair.

Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, it is very satisfying to see the culmination and conclusion of such an important report. I should like to offer my warmest thanks to colleagues, the shadow rapporteurs, the groups and the officials who have made this outcome possible. Reducing harmful alcohol consumption has in recent years become one of the priorities of health and social policies throughout the world, and the European Union is playing its part here too. The European Commission gave us a text that contained a great deal of food for thought, which we have tried to build on and supplement. Examination of the harm caused by alcohol abuse gave an extremely bleak and worrying picture: very high mortality among young people, in particular as a result of road accidents, ill-treatment in the family, growing numbers of cases of foetal alcohol syndrome, increasingly widespread liver disease and alcohol dependence, among young people as well, in all the Member States. The costs of health treatment amount in Europe to EUR 17 billion, alongside the EUR 5 billion spent on treatment and prevention. It should be stressed that it is alcohol abuse that is the problem; alcohol consumption cannot be demonised per se since it is part of the culture, history and traditions of many Member States and the quality of some alcohol products in many cases makes them the jewel in the crown of the producer countries. The employment aspect should not be forgotten either. It is estimated that alcohol production and processing provides jobs for over a million people in Europe. The European Commission, which I thank, presented a communication focusing on a number of priorities which we have taken up while attempting to extend their scope through various key points: in-depth examination of the problem of consumption by young people, comprehensive provision of information, assistance and prevention, better public information campaigns making the community aware of the risks that they run when they consume alcohol irresponsibly, and examination of the problems of violence, especially domestic, connected with alcohol consumption. In particular, measures to counter the harm resulting from abuse include: awareness-raising and risk education campaigns in schools, targeted on parents as well, making more public transport available as an alternative to private transport for people leaving night-time venues and support for initiatives by individual States focusing on the ‘don’t drink and drive’ principle, a European prize for the best information campaign run in schools, financial support for the dissemination of instruments enabling people themselves to monitor their blood alcohol content, and strict action against ‘alcopops’. Another of the innovative points of the report, which has been welcomed by the Commission, is the idea of using the so-called brief intervention to disseminate a responsible and informed approach to alcohol consumption. General practitioners, through the daily and direct relationship that they have with patients, could be a valuable resource for identifying alcohol-related problems even before patients themselves become aware of them: a simple questionnaire, known as an audit, which is already being tried out in some European cities, could supplement such personal action. Other measures in particular include the promotion of measures to reduce the road accidents caused by alcohol abuse, for instance by stepping up checks on drink-driving, disseminating tests enabling people themselves to monitor their blood alcohol content, offering incentives for ‘designated-driver’ programmes, lowering admissible blood alcohol contents and introducing harsher penalties for drink-drivers. The report proposes, and here it seems to have the support of all the European Parliament’s groups, a blood alcohol content limit which is as close as possible to 0 for new drivers, in order to provide a concrete foundation for the strategy which goes beyond the simple statement of principle and the caution shown by the Commission in its text, even though many of the measures that could be adopted to counter alcohol abuse come within the competence of the individual States, especially measures in the health and safety field. The European Union can try to stimulate, offer incentives for, promote and suggest the adoption of some of these measures. One of the issues on which consensus was lacking was undoubtedly the question of labelling to highlight the risks and dangers of excessive alcohol consumption. On a personal level, I feel that I should ask the Commission for a detailed study from which the various systems of information and communication, including labelling, can be drawn up. In conclusion, the strategy, as amended by Parliament, could provide substantial added value over individual national policies, especially as it would be possible to direct the work of the Member States towards common objectives. In the text of the report, I have tried above all to tackle this issue in a balanced and common-sense way, avoiding any demonisation of moderate alcohol consumption in order to take account of the centuries-old tradition of responsible drinking, and by trying to suggest measures likely to counter the problems which are unfortunately now so common in Europe and throughout the world. I should like to thank everyone for their support and cooperation.

 Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, economic theory based on sustainable development abandons the approach grounded only in an analysis of GDP and employment in favour of an interpretation of a country’s cyclical position. Work is natural capital, the capital produced by people. The European sustainable development strategy and the Lisbon Agenda must integrate the economic dimension with the social and environmental dimensions in order to guarantee long-term development. For this strategy to be successful, it is essential to act at all levels of governance, from the largest international and national organisations to the local Agenda 21, which in Italy too is at last becoming one of the most important forces driving the spread of a sustainable management model. Acting at a local level is the key principle that makes it possible to pursue major objectives like preserving what natural capital is left, reducing human pressure on the world around us, and improving the efficiency of the end uses of products, for instance by promoting energy-efficient buildings and environmentally friendly urban transport systems. The extension of Commission support to the system of so-called ‘green’ public works contracts is producing good results. Nevertheless, in common with Members in other groups – and I am glad to have heard the speaker before me – I must highlight a number of aspects that I consider very important. The Commission ought to be more specific and to stick to definite and therefore verifiable objectives. That is the only way that all the actors in the sustainable economy will be encouraged to adopt an ecologically and socially compatible model. There is still a great deal to do in Europe to ensure that our energy supplies are based on renewable sources, in order to protect the environment from pollution and from the excessive, irreversible exploitation of natural resources. In this context I consider it essential for sustainable development indicators to be developed and improved: they need to be easily understood and accessible to the general public. It is important to try to monitor all the outcomes.

Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I should like simply to highlight some formal and substantive errors with regard to the translation of the Italian text. For example, in the fourth line of paragraph 3, the Italian text reads ‘clearly recognise the State of Israel’, whereas the English text refers to the ‘State of Israel’s right to exist’. I therefore call for this correction to be made, as I believe it is crucial. The same goes for paragraph 10, in which ‘concrete and positive recommendations’ are mentioned, whereas the English text only mentions ‘concrete’, and not positive, recommendations.

Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, thank you for kindly allowing me to take the floor. It seemed almost impossible to speak in this fine Chamber during the debate on the highly important REACH provision. The Union for Europe of the Nations Group has decided to vote in favour, because we are satisfied as regards the registration procedure and we wholly agree with the content of the regulation in connection with the OSOR principle. We do, however, have some concerns with regard to the procedure for authorisation. Nevertheless, we are generally in agreement regarding this project, and I should to thank the rapporteur, Mr Sacconi, for his commitment and for the work he has done.
 Alessandro Foglietta (UEN
). –  
(IT) 
Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I should like to take my cue from Mr Sacconi’s reflections: he spent last Sunday thinking over this measure, which is certainly a compromise but which also entails considerable responsibility. In my view, however, Mr Sacconi has made some fundamental mistakes, especially in terms of relations with others. Thus to reach a compromise he should have shared his reflections with the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Food Safety: otherwise his position is a purely personal one, not one shared by the committee. That is why, Mr Sacconi, I think you have taken the wrong route in deciding not to seek a solution of the most general application possible. In this connection I should like to make some observations concerning the OSOR (one substance, one registration) system. I think that we ought to try to find a solution that separates the OSOR system from the REACH package, because as things stand, as has been emphasised several times, small and medium-sized enterprises are not protected. It would furthermore be useful to speak about tonnage in cases where costs become too high. I nevertheless believe that in the case of hazardous products, the costs of tonnage should be duly taken into account without ever losing sight of the danger aspect. Moreover, I do not agree with the decision to split the list of products into two parts, since this would discriminate against some hazardous products and some firms.

 Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, in managing the risk of a pandemic, we need to monitor the current situation, coordinate the response and, above all, avoid creating panic, while ensuring that antiviral drugs are distributed widely and fairly. That is why we have proposed some amendments designed to promote monitoring, using all resources available. The European Union must have an active role in managing the possible risk of the H5N1 virus spreading among animals. We therefore need to act in advance with preventive measures. We also need to give priority to reassuring consumers and thereby avoiding a pointless panic, which would be harmful both to the population itself and to the poultry industry. Our proposal to introduce the compulsory labelling of white meat, as already applies in the case of beef, aims at achieving precisely that objective. We also consider that a timely campaign of information would be useful, advising consumers of the true risks, the possibility of prevention and the availability of drugs. Finally, we need to ensure there is a strategy to enable all Member States to produce antiviral drugs in sufficient quantities, with the direct involvement of pharmaceutical companies, and to devote our available resources also to that end.

 Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I congratulate the rapporteur on the work she has done, which above all has the merit of bringing the intent of our legislation closer to the criteria that we promised to fulfil at Kyoto. Even in the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Food Safety, I felt it necessary to distance myself from certain positions that appear only to favour sectional objectives and are likely to produce a much more disastrous outcome both for the environment and for many Member States’ economies. First of all, on the issue of the legal basis, the shift to Article 175 may result in a distortion of the single market concept, since it allows individual Member States to introduce more restrictive requirements and measures. Choosing Article 175 as the legal basis might lead to a paradox whereby some countries may decide to prohibit the use of SF6 but then resort to current alternatives that are more polluting and less safe than fluorinated gases. We must not forget that the purpose of the regulation is to contain fluorinated gas emissions and not to ban them. Any ban – I am referring to Articles 7 and 8 in particular – should be preceded by a study assessing both the economic impact and the environmental benefit. I must emphasise that it is pointless to cause serious economic damage to countries that base part of their economies on the responsible use of those gases when there is no likelihood of gaining appreciable environmental benefits, while even causing greater harm in some cases. It is pointless to resort to bans that cannot offer any feasible scientific alternatives, when at the moment it would be enough to reduce emissions. It is pointless to hinder harmonisation, when this move puts even safety at work at risk. Fluorinated gases have high energy efficiency, are non-flammable and non-toxic, and can be handled and managed by workers in total safety. Statistics show that the alternative solutions have caused many deaths in the workplace. An approach based on responsible use, with the same rules for all the Member States, has the clear advantage of being a win-win solution. It provides a reduction in the energy costs associated with a guaranteed high degree of safety, and the environment benefits as greenhouse gas emissions are cut to the absolute minimum.

 Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, the forthcoming European Council will be particularly significant because, as the representatives of both institutions have indicated, it will certainly have to deal with particularly important subjects, such as the enlargement of the Union to include Bulgaria and Romania, the possible start of negotiations with Croatia and Turkey, a review of progress in the fight against terrorism and, in particular, the addition of information capacity within the General Secretariat of the Council and the preparation of the financial framework for the period 2007-2013. We have often said that Bulgaria and Romania ought to join the Union, though we are particularly concerned about the areas in which there is still a wide gap between the current situation in those two countries and the European average. In that respect we would point to their legislation on human rights, social protection for workers and economic development, which should reach significant levels by the end of the decade. Although in principle we are in favour of starting negotiations with Turkey – which, I stress, is a very different thing from accession – we must not forget the need for its acknowledgement of the Armenian genocide and for a lasting solution to the Cyprus question. To somebody with any common sense, it is incomprehensible that a country that aspires to join the Union should be militarily occupying part of another country that is already a member. We are not at all worried about the voting system that we should use. I believe in the freedom of all Members to make their own decisions, regardless of whether the vote is open or in secret. I think this is just a formality and certainly not a question of any substance. The fight against terrorism is closely linked to the development of the Middle East peace process and the situation in certain countries where conflicts are not yet over. I believe, however, that the Union should maintain an ever stronger presence through its policies and aid in those parts of the world that surround it and in which there are ongoing, sometimes tragic situations of conflict. By doing so it can exert a stabilising influence to support those sections of society that accept the values which characterise our democracy.

Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, I would like to thank the Czech Presidency, the Commission, Mrs Niebler, as the Chairman of the Committee on Industry, Research and Energy, my fellow rapporteurs on this energy package, the shadow rapporteurs and the committee’s secretariat, including all its officials, for their cooperation and for the skill they have displayed in working on this issue. We all can and should be proud of the result we have achieved; I certainly am, thinking about the work I did when I inherited the directive on the internal market in gas, with problems that had no easy solutions. I am happy that this, my second term of office as an MEP, has coincided with the concluding stage of this package, which I believe to be one of the most important matters dealt with in this term of office, and one which will benefit our electorate, the citizens of Europe. The Gas Directive that will enter into force from 2011 brings in significant innovations in the sector: one important result that should be emphasised is that the ITO option has been achieved. This will open up the markets and ensure that real progress is made towards a system that will genuinely allow the European Union to speak with one voice on energy issues. The ITO system is the true innovation in this package and it is the area where the European Parliament can be said to have achieved the best outcome. The new Gas Directive attributes much importance to the gas authorities and to the agency. The directive gives legitimacy to the authorities in their role, particularly in those countries where they are to start their activities from scratch. It is therefore a matter of fundamental importance that we have designated the role and responsibilities of these bodies, and have given them broad powers, since the authorities have the difficult task of controlling the common energy market. Another detail, which was added in at the trialogue stage, is the exemption from the common rules for so-called ‘closed’ systems, such as airports, hospitals, stations, industrial sites, and so on, which because of their specific individual features are subject to a more favourable system. This is an example of the attention paid by the new directive to the needs of European citizens. In my view, it is, in fact, European citizens that will really benefit from this directive, since with the use of smart meters they will have access to all the information relating to their bills and will be able to assess the best offer on the market and to choose their supplier on the basis of the best price, because while it is true that it will take some years to see the effects of this liberalisation, nonetheless it cannot be denied that the entry of new operators onto the market will lead to a fall in prices and to more favourable market conditions for EU citizens. Another important element is the recognition of European transmission network systems that will provide gas supply security to European citizens. All this also hinges on the strengthening and creation of new infrastructure such as regasification facilities and storage facilities, which will be the driving force behind the third package. What is required, therefore, is the opening up of a competitive market, ensuring long-term investment and contracts from firms in the sector, particularly in the new Member States, where the creation of new infrastructure would also make it possible to resolve long-standing problems relating to energy dependence. The protection of more vulnerable consumers has been taken into account, by giving the national and regional authorities the option to guarantee their gas supplies at the most critical times. The successful outcome on this Gas Directive and the energy package as a whole once more highlights the role of Europe and its institutions in acting for European citizens.
 Antonio Mussa,  
rapporteur. 
− (IT) 
Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, a very strong feeling has emerged from this joint debate: great satisfaction at having created, in the shape of this third package from the Committee on Industry, Research and Energy, a package that is important for European citizens. It will naturally not be the last package, because – as you know – there is a huge impetus towards the use of alternative sources of energy, such as renewables and nuclear energy. Over the next 10, 15 or 20 years, however, it will certainly provide for the demand and need for energy and will provide for, and of course protect, consumers, particularly the most vulnerable ones. I believe that Mrs Morgan, myself and all the other Members involved have played a significant role in the protection of vulnerable consumers, giving considerable powers to both the national and regional authorities, which can, at times of crisis, make changes – I am not saying that they can give energy for free – but they will certainly be able to make changes and permit a continuous supply of energy. The other fundamental point is this: that Europe’s population is unaware of all that we have done at the Commission, the Council and in Parliament on this package, which is of crucial importance for energy consumers – you saw what happened last winter. I think there is nothing worse than not letting those who benefit from a major project know about it. I think that the task that should fall to the Commission, the Council and Parliament, even before we concern ourselves with the application of this package, is to let consumers know that the package exists, let them know what has been done for them, on their behalf and, once again, for them.

Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, the car crisis is one of the most serious in the global manufacturing industry because, aside from having grave economic and employment-related repercussions for European factories and allied companies, it is hitting third countries, to which production has increasingly been shifted over the past few decades. Moreover, if the Union is to bring the industry’s profits at least back up to what they were in 2007, it cannot sustain the social cost of around 350 000 job cuts. We should therefore welcome what is at least harmonised assistance for the sector, provided that it is in addition to job protection. The key words for European businesses must be cutting-edge research and development. It is clear that, as the market develops, recourse to mergers or strategic agreements is another possible route, but this must not be at the cost of Europe’s car-making tradition, which is the jewel in the crown of the Community manufacturing industry.

I greatly valued Mrs Laperrouze’s work and have therefore voted in favour of its adoption. I only hope that the ideas and indications she has supplied in her report will be adequately appraised by the Commission and interpreted in the most positive and wide-ranging way possible. I therefore hope that no obstacles will be put in the way of the quickest possible definition of projects regarding infrastructures and that they will be appraised in accordance with priorities that relate solely to development times, financial structure, available supplies and the relationship between public support and private commitment. In this connection, the presentation of the Commission’s proposals for the European Recovery Plan, with a plan for financial support for certain projects, neglects the Mediterranean area by excluding the Algeria­Sardinia­Italy natural gas pipeline (including the section within Italy) from the highest priority European projects. I still hope that within the ambit of diversification of sources and supply routes, we can make gradual progress, making use of new opportunities to start on infrastructure where it is lacking. I hope that the mechanisms of solidarity will not permit market distortions or give rise to excessively onerous procedures. I hope that the Energy Charter will be able to play a fundamental role together with the enlargement of the Energy Community, in particular, in relation to transit countries, including in the field of renewable energy sources.
 Antonio Mussa,

 Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I would like to offer my sincere thanks to Mrs Laperrouze for her work, with which I agree to a large extent. I am, however, confused with regard to certain aspects, perhaps due to excessive reliance on the Commission’s assessments. Firstly, I feel that the predicted trend in gas demand is restrictive. If that is the case, I fear it will have a negative impact on sources of financing for projects. With regard to infrastructure, the relevant projects are at different stages of development. Rather than redefining their order of priority in an abstract way, while seriously overlooking the Mediterranean area, it would be advisable, instead, to reassess them in terms of development times, financial structure, available supplies and the link between public support and private commitment. Mrs Laperrouze next recommended diversifying the sources and routes of supply. One example is the Southern Corridor. With regard to these issues, I feel a programmed approach is required, divided into phases. Indeed, in the case of the Caspian, only gas from Azerbaijan will be available in the first phase. Access to other countries will occur in the second phase, therefore making the market more complicated in political, regulatory and infrastructure terms. The Commission’s proposal for a Caspian Development Cooperation can overcome these problems, if it will be tasked with, among other things, facilitating the development of missing infrastructure. The penultimate aspect is that solidarity mechanisms are undoubtedly fundamental for the Union’s energy policies, as well as in relation to the Treaty of Lisbon. It would be advisable, however, for the feasibility of these measures to avoid, in addition to potential distortions, excessively cumbersome procedures. Finally, I would like to turn to external relations. Apart from the role of the Energy Charter, enlarging the Energy Committee, particularly to include transit countries as well as the field of renewable energy, is an important objective

Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, the Committee on Regional Development has been called on by the Committee on Agriculture and Rural Development to give an opinion on the proposal for a Council regulation on support for rural development by the European Agricultural Fund for Rural Development (EAFRD), which has now reached the Chamber for debate within the context of the more general EUR 5 billion package. The measure in question can be seen as a timely response by the Commission to the needs underpinning the decision, adopted by the Council on 11 and 12 December 2008, to approve a European economic recovery plan containing specific measures in many sectors of Community and national competence to tackle the economic and financial crisis that has involved the European markets since 2007. In the rural development sector, the Commission measure proposes the introduction of appropriate updates to Council Regulation No 1698/2005 that are designed to implement the guidelines of the said European plan. Taken as a whole, the Commission’s proposal – which provides for a budget of EUR 1.5 billion to be made available to all the Member States through the European Fund for Rural Development, to develop access to broadband Internet in rural areas and to confront the new challenges identified in the medium-term common agricultural policy reform assessment, concluded in November 2008 – has the full support of the Committee on Regional Development, which feels that the suggested measures, if implemented quickly and in full, will certainly be able to help pick up the national economies and make consumers trust in the system again, while also effectively pursuing objectives of territorial and social convergence in regions of the Union. All of this is particularly true if the measures are combined with the need, expressed by the Council, to maximise spending opportunities during the early years. In expressing its opinion, the committee did not limit itself to a simple evaluation of the measures proposed by the European Commission but decided to make its own proposal by including certain amendments in the text submitted to it. The main aspect that the Committee on Regional Development wished to highlight is that which refers to the need to increase transparency and information on results obtained during the period 2009­2011 and to provide appropriate instruments for coordinating actions funded by the EAFRD and the Structural Funds in relation to broadband Internet infrastructure. It did this by asking the Commission to insert a section specifically devoted to the verification of the results obtained in relation to this activity within the annual monitoring report required for the European Agricultural Fund for Rural Development, in the form of a specific amendment introduced in the text of the proposed measure.

 Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I too would like to thank the Community institutions for the support they have shown for Italy and the people hit by the earthquake. These have been difficult days, further aggravated by the weather conditions of the last 48 hours. But after the grief and destruction comes the time for practical proposals and reconstruction, the time to restore a future for the Abruzzo region. We are asking the European institutions to do their bit; in fact the Commission has already given its guarantee through Vice-President Tajani, who was very prompt to assure us of his commitment in the immediate aftermath of the disaster. As the Commission itself today confirmed, first of all we must verify all available financial resources, guarantee the swift activation of the European Solidarity Fund for natural disasters, and then look at the possibility of making full use of and reprogramming the European Social Fund and other Community programmes to support employment and businesses. However, we are calling in particular for the possibility of introducing extraordinary legislative measures, tax breaks, incentives and aid possibly as an exception to current de minimis 
provisions. These would be measures authorised by the European Union and valid for two or three years, that is to say for the time needed until the end of the emergency and reconstruction. On these subjects and on these objectives, as today’s debate has also shown, we are all in agreement, there are no divisions. I too would like to conclude with heartfelt thoughts for the victims, their families and the people affected, but I am especially proud, as an Italian woman from that area, to extend special thanks once more for the efforts made by the institutions, all the political parties and above all the rescue teams, civil protection and the Red Cross. I also thank all the voluntary organisations and individual citizens who did what they could and made a personal contribution or gave money to express their solidarity and provide real help; they are a truly outstanding example of efficiency and humanity.

 Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, first of all I would like to congratulate the rapporteur on the excellent work he has accomplished. Copyright protection currently lasts for a maximum of 50 years, and in my opinion this period is not sufficient to give fair remuneration to artists for their creative work and performance. Indeed, it is important to improve the social situation of artists through greater protection, provided by the institutions. It is for this reason that we are in favour of extending the copyright protection period to 95 years, and we are requesting that the additional earnings generated by this extension be given exclusively to the artists and that, in particular, for the additional 45 years, the latter should be released from the contractual obligation requiring them to transfer part of the revenue to third parties. This measure should in fact be exclusively aimed at providing a genuine advantage for authors and performers. On the other hand, it would also be desirable for the Commission to assess the impact of and need to widen the scope of this extension to include the audiovisual sector.

Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, having consulted the political groups and the heads of the Italian delegations, on behalf of my group, I am asking you to agree to add a debate on the earthquake in Abruzzo to tomorrow’s agenda. I believe that the people who have been affected appreciate the solidarity shown by the European institutions and by you in person, with the condolences expressed and the minute of silence, and they will also appreciate any financial and legislative support for reconstruction. For these reasons, a debate in the presence of the European Commission could provide national and local institutions with a lot of useful information about how much the European Union will be able to do.

 Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, first of all I would like to congratulate the rapporteur on the excellent job he has done. I am certain one of thing: this will give additional impetus to the spread of Ecolabel products in Europe. At a time when the environment is the burning issue and the demand for green products is rising, even in non-European countries such as the United States and China, the Ecolabel will be one of the tools that makes European products increasingly competitive on the international market. In fact the Ecolabel is more than just a mark of environmental quality: through ongoing upward adjustment of product environmental excellence requirements, the Ecolabel will become an incentive for continuous improvement and innovation. This report will allow a greater spread of Ecolabel products, promoting awareness of them without in any way reducing consumer health protection guarantees. To conclude, my country, Italy, is ranked among the leading countries in Europe for the number of licences granted, and a large number of these were taken out by the tourism sector, which can derive benefit from this European environmental quality certification label that is both appreciated and guaranteed by the European public.

Mr President, on the admissibility of Mrs Vălean’s amendment: Mrs Vălean was quite right to go back and correct the text, removing the vague and misleading reference to third and fourth wives, which led to doubts over the legitimacy of polygamy. We should nevertheless clarify that, unfortunately, the questionnaire sent to the Member States contained this incorrect terminology. In other words, Member States were asked for their opinion on the right to free movement of second, third and fourth wives. (The President cut off the speaker)

 Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, other Members have already said this, but I would like to reiterate that the Internet should not be criminalised or censored because it provides opportunities for communication, socialisation, information and knowledge, but there is nonetheless a need to develop a global strategy to combat cybercrime. In particular, we must protect children and educate and inform parents and teachers about the new potential dangers of the web. These are objectives on which Europe must be able to act effectively and I would like to congratulate the rapporteur on a good job well done. However, despite the penalties and fairly high level of protection afforded by Member States’ legislation against online abuse and sexual exploitation of children and child pornography, the standard of child protection must be raised further, not least because of the ongoing development of new technologies, especially the Internet, and the use of new forms of online grooming of children by paedophiles. It was for precisely this reason that I chose to table an amendment to the report, explicitly calling on Member States to update their legislation on the use of the Internet by minors, in particular by introducing the offence of grooming, as defined by the Council of Europe Convention on the Protection of Children against Sexual Exploitation and Sexual Abuse, of October 2007.

Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, the car industry is one of the key industries of the European economy and one that has a great deal at risk with the current crisis. Therefore now is not the time to repeat that we should be against protectionism and unfair competition. All that is terribly superfluous. Now is the time also to offer strategic, clear and courageous certainties to European producers and workers with – I wish to stress this point – a support plan that gives the same opportunities to all the Member States. The objectives include, of course, guaranteeing better use of the European funds, including the Globalisation Adjustment Fund, but above all simplifying and increasing financial support for the sector through the EIB and the ECB, so that it can apply for low-interest loans, and also simplifying the administrative procedures. To conclude, I would say that more generally, the aim is to keep the sector competitive and to ensure that all European initiatives, in addition to tackling the current crisis, can help to launch a positive phase of restructuring and transformation of the car industry.

 Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, the European cosmetics industry is a very important sector in terms of the economy and employment. As has been said, it represents a turnover of more than EUR 35 billion and more than 350 000 jobs among sales, distribution and transport. It is a high-innovation sector, but I too would emphasise that a high level of protection for human health and a high standard of consumer information must be guaranteed. It is on precisely these grounds that I congratulate the rapporteur on her excellent work, and I would like to highlight certain points I believe to be of particular importance. It is right to subject products to a safety assessment that also gives distributors a responsibility for completing the necessary checks before marketing the goods. The ban imposed by the new regulation on more than 1 000 substances used in cosmetics that have been classified as carcinogenic or toxic is also a good thing. Another important aspect is the list of permitted colourants, preservatives and solar filters, and greater clarity in labelling on the function of the cosmetic, its shelf life, specific warnings for its use and a list of ingredients in descending order by weight is also essential. Most importantly, the label must feature words, marks or images that attribute realistic characteristics and functions to the product and not characteristics or functions that it does not possess. It will therefore be necessary to guarantee product traceability, not least because we must prevent the worrying phenomenon of the counterfeiting of cosmetics and so-called ‘parallel imports’. I will finish, Mr President, by pointing out that in Italy alone, EUR 120 million of cosmetic products, including perfumes and toothpaste, in fact come from the parallel market, with potential serious effects on health.

 Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, dialogue and political and commercial collaboration with Brazil is an important goal for Europe; a goal to be developed and strengthened, beginning with the fight against poverty, particularly among children, and moving towards strong commercial agreements to build up trade and investment. However, this strategic partnership cannot avoid certain immovable points. Firstly, the need for greater cooperation in the fight against corruption, organised crime, cross-border crime, drug trafficking, money laundering and international terrorism. Secondly, the need for close collaboration in legal matters, notably with regard to collaboration in extradition procedures and the mutual recognition of judicial rulings.

 Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, this Parliament cannot allow the recent cry of pain from the Dalai Lama to go unheard. Only a few months ago we listened to him speak in Brussels; we all know him to be a gentle man, a peace-maker, a spokesman for Tibetan culture, that is to say the culture of harmony and fraternity par excellence
. It is in the name of these values, speaking of his ‘Chinese brothers’, that the Dalai Lama has asked – forcefully, however – for legitimate and tangible autonomy for Tibet, recalling the torture and terrible suffering of his people and his land. This is a request that Parliament should be proud to support. It is our political and institutional duty, in the name of democracy, human rights and the values of freedom. The Tibetans look to Europe, perhaps, as their only hope; we really must not disappoint them.

Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, we should remember that we cannot uphold women’s rights in any document that deals with employment or equal opportunities unless we can count on satisfactory childcare facilities, without which mediation is impossible and rights count for nothing. These matters are more pertinent than ever now that we are faced with problems raised by the economic crisis. In the European Union, more than six million women aged 25 to 49 state that they are forced to be unemployed or work part time due to their family responsibilities. The situation of more than one quarter of these women stems from the lack of childcare facilities or their excessive cost. Six years after the adoption of the Barcelona objectives, as the 2010 deadline approaches, we find that most Member States will not achieve these objectives, which were not even particularly ambitious: guaranteeing access to childcare facilities for 30% of children under the age of three. We must therefore work hard to achieve satisfactory levels of availability of children’s services, beginning with services for children aged under three. For this reason, I am very happy that today’s ECOFIN Council has approved the possibility for all Member States to cut VAT on children’s services. I believe that this is a considerable incentive and a common sense gesture that could help to relaunch the childcare plan and a plan for services for children and families throughout the European Union.

 Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, the proposal to extend the application of reduced VAT to certain labour-intensive services, restaurants and the maintenance and construction of buildings represents a great opportunity to have a positive economic impact on the market and employment in the context of the current severe economic crisis. Competition will not be affected, rather this will be a chance to give a slight boost to production and to stimulate consumption, create new jobs and support businesses and families. In my opinion, it would be beneficial to extend the scope of reduced VAT rates still further, for example to cover ‘green services’ in order to encourage environmental policies. As far as the text we are to vote on is concerned, I particularly welcome the proposal to cut VAT on babies’ nappies and children’s services. This Parliament has asked the Commission and the Member States on several occasions to improve coordination between macroeconomic and social policies in order to redress the rise in new forms of poverty. Indeed, we must not forget that approximately 17% of European families are now living below the poverty line and one child in five is poor. So we await the Council’s response – I hope that it will be able to adopt this proposal as soon as possible and open a wider and more ambitious debate on promoting fiscal policies for families as well as businesses, and perhaps come to extend reduced VAT to all children’s goods.

 Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, with this joint motion for a resolution, this Parliament will make its authoritative voice heard, at international level, for reconsideration of the extradition of Cesare Battisti and, above all, it will pay tribute to the memory of the victims and show its solidarity with their families who, for more than 20 years, have been waiting for their fundamental right to justice, denied for so long, to at last be fulfilled. There is no need to say more, and so, Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, I would like to dedicate the few remaining seconds of my speaking time to observe a moment’s silence in remembrance.
 Roberta Angelilli,

 Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I would like to begin by thanking my fellow Members for their excellent collaboration, which has enabled us, in my opinion, to draft a highly satisfactory text. I am also grateful to all the NGOs and institutions that have followed our work closely. Their valuable suggestions have enhanced the report. We set out with two key objectives, the first being to check carefully to what extent the 2003 framework decision is being implemented within the 27 Member States, and the second being to propose improvements as necessary. The fact is that the framework decision must be updated to increase the level of protection for minors, in light of the rise in new and disturbing cases of exploitation linked to new technologies. The first of the priorities identified is the fight against sex tourism, which worryingly is on the rise, partly because of lower travel costs. From this point of view, extra-territorial cooperation should be improved and Member States should be asked to rule out the principle of double criminality for crimes concerning the exploitation and abuse of children. Secondly, grooming, that is to say online psychological manipulation with the aim of soliciting children for sexual purposes, should be considered a criminal offence in all Member States. Thirdly, Member States should be bound to exchange the information contained in criminal records relating to sexual abuse convictions. The aim of this is to categorically eliminate the possibility that perpetrators of sexual abuse could hold jobs that involve contact with children. Among the proposals to be implemented as soon as possible is the launch of the missing child rapid alert system. This system has already been trialled and implemented, although by only a small number of Member States and so only at trial level, but has given excellent results. We therefore need to roll it out across all 27 Member States. It is worth remembering, in fact, that every year in Europe, thousands and thousands of children disappear without trace. I would like to highlight one further aspect: in general, national legislative authorities must commit to improving protection for child victims during investigations and before and after any court case in which children are involved. This will prevent children from becoming victims twice over, firstly victims of violation, and then victims of media or legal violation. Finally, we have highlighted the need for urgency in criminalising forced marriages, the majority of which concern children. To conclude, Mr President, I believe it is important to ask all Member States to ratify as soon as possible the most recent Council of Europe Convention on the Protection of Children against Sexual Exploitation and Sexual Abuse. This is the convention of October 2007, the benchmark representing the most innovative and up-to-date act on child protection.

 Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, I would like to thank my fellow Members once again for their thoughts and the support shown during the debate and, in conclusion, I would like to extend a special thank you to the European Commission for its active collaboration. To Mr Barrot I owe a particular debt of gratitude, since even this morning he demonstrated extremely strong political and legislative will in terms of child protection. He really has provided much food for thought and, above all, practical commitment. I would like to take this opportunity to make a few additional points. Firstly, there is a lack of data. Too often we lack sufficient data, statistics, which are indispensable as a basis for our work in better monitoring, better understanding and, of course, better combating child abuse. This lack of data is – how can I put it – a recurring issue, but I think it important to emphasise since it is a shortcoming that we must overcome. As far as data protection is concerned, some Members raised this topic and the Commissioner has already given them a very specific response. I would like to stress that I am very aware of data protection and I do not believe that there is a conflict between privacy and children’s rights, if, of course, the institutions play their part and if everyone, from the providers to the police, respects the rules. Moreover, I would point out that children are, in fact, those with the greatest need for privacy and data protection. Mr Barrot mentioned this too: often during legal proceedings, when a scandal breaks in which the victim is sadly a child, it is precisely the exploited child that is fed to the media without any form of protection, and I would say without any compassion either for their image or for their privacy, and all simply to boost television ratings and sell a few more newspapers. I would also like to add that no child is exempt from these dangers, and unaccompanied children and Roma children are often even more vulnerable. I will conclude, Madam President, by saying that clearly a significant effort is needed at a cultural and political level, and this effort must be made by families, schools and the media. Much can be done in terms of self-regulation, but without binding, weighty legislative instruments, clearly, we cannot fight cases of exploitation behind which there are not only individuals but often actual criminal organisations.

Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, Commissioner, you are a thoroughly sensible person and I therefore invite you, and in so doing, associate myself with other Members, to go to Lampedusa and, I beg you, to go without prior warning, so that you find out in person how difficult it is to manage an emergency situation of this kind. This is the situation of an island of only a few square kilometres where thousands and thousands of people have been continuously disembarking for many years – and during this period, left- and right-wing governments have come and gone. Some of these people die during the journey because of the inhumane conditions to which they are subjected by unscrupulous people traffickers. What therefore should be done: ignore the rules? In order to proceed to possible repatriation or to check whether they have political refugee status or need to be granted political asylum, these people have to be identified and this obviously takes time. Enough then of demagoguery! Italy is paying a price in terms of very heavy responsibility which is disproportionate to the support, both financial and legislative, that is given by the European Union.

Mr President, having consulted many of my fellow Members, I would ask you for an amendment to the agenda just as you have said. Specifically, I would ask if the Battisti affair can be included as an urgent matter. As a matter of fact, a few days ago, the Brazilian Government decided to refuse to extradite the terrorist Cesare Battisti, who had been sentenced to life imprisonment for committing four murders, and granted this killer the status of political refugee. This decision, as well as being an affront to the institutions and to Italian justice, is an insult to the memory of the victims and to their families, and has outraged public opinion. That is the reason for this request that, among other things, I believe should be heard, and because the request initially came from the highest public officials in Italy, starting with the President of the Republic, Mr Napolitano. That is therefore the reason for the request.

Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I truly welcome the comments by the Commissioner and Mr Pöttering, in denouncing in no uncertain terms the grave responsibility that Hamas bears for having put an end to the truce, but equally clearly judging the Israeli reaction to be totally disproportionate. Beyond the words, however, the crisis remains, and there are still thousands of people – the civilian population and children – who are in desperate need of humanitarian aid. In all conscience, and without hypocrisy, perhaps we should ask ourselves some questions. While our children were celebrating Christmas, how many children died in Gaza? Two or three hundred; and how many Israeli civilians? Could the international community have done more? In my opinion, the answer is yes. It ought to have done more. We should feel the full weight of our responsibilities. It is not enough to broadcast views on Hamas, on Israel, on the initial responsibility, or on who is more to blame. Unfortunately, above and beyond the emergency, Europe remains inadequate. In my view this is a serious inadequacy: an incapacity to build a real, strategic and lasting peace policy. Today, clearly, we must issue a strong demand for a cease-fire, but this is not enough. We must set out strict conditions to accompany the peace and development process in the Middle East. To finish, I would also like to refer to the words of the Pope, who said that we need to give specific answers to the general aspirations of many in those lands to live in peace, security and dignity, as Mrs Morgantini also pointed out. Mr President, I really am finishing. Violence, hatred and distrust are forms of poverty – perhaps the most terrible to combat.

 Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I would like to start by congratulating the rapporteur on the excellent job he has done. As the rapporteur for the EU strategy on the rights of the child, it falls to me to stress certain important points in Mr Coelho’s report, even though other fellow Members have already done so. Firstly, the principle of guaranteeing a common approach to regulations protecting children who cross our external borders is very welcome. Secondly, the principle of ‘one person-one passport’ is important, because it directly links the biometric data to the document holder. This does away with all the procedures currently in use that allow for children to be added to their parents’ passports. This practice makes it much more difficult and unreliable to check the identity of the child, making it easier to snatch children involved in disputes and also to trade and exploit children. Thirdly, the report also envisages that the Commission will submit a report examining the technical feasibility of using fingerprints for the purposes of identifying children under the age of 12. It is very important to work to improve the system and ensure its reliability, particularly for child protection. I will conclude by saying that in my opinion it will be extremely helpful in future to identify the most sophisticated, appropriate and safe technical methods to record and thus categorically certify the identity and age of a child as early as is feasible, from birth if possible.

 Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, first of all I would like to thank the rapporteur for the work he has accomplished. I would like to say to the French Presidency, whom I thank nonetheless for their commitment, that sufficient effort was not made to talk effectively with Parliament. Ours is a very delicate debate this evening, our words must be determined by the greatest responsibility, as must the policies that will follow. We must be fully aware that every watered-down compromise is made at the expense of the lives of workers and therefore a compromise at all costs can have a price to pay in terms of health, safety and reconciliation of work and family life. We all know full well that the world of work has changed and is changing further still, in the last few weeks, in the last few days, beneath the shock wave of the economic crisis. We are all convinced that there is a need for greater flexibility, but this must be achieved in a balanced way, above all without exerting undue pressure on workers’ rights in the name of urgency. The Council’s proposals pose some very serious questions, as all the other rapporteurs have said before me. The first being the opt-out. On the one hand there is an appreciation of the fact that this formula is highly problematic and therefore a revision clause is provided, but this is done in a generic way, without fixing a definite date, and on the other hand there is a kind of veiled blackmail, since if the text of the Council’s common position were to fail then the current directive would stay in place, with an entirely unrestricted opt-out. Secondly there is the whole issue of the concept of on-call time, which in practice tends to be considered equal to a rest period. On this subject – as all the other Members have said before me – there can be no room for ambiguity, because any ambiguity is absolutely unacceptable. Finally, reconciliation: reconciliation cannot be an abstract term given to generic formulas or so-called ‘reasonable terms’ that in reality then become sleight of hand – collective bargaining is abandoned, thus forcing workers, above all female workers, to accept the conditions imposed simply to avoid losing their jobs. It is therefore clear to me that a review of the directive is necessary and would undoubtedly be useful, but whatever happens, we must not replace a legislative vacuum with worrying ambiguities.

Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I fully agree with the approach adopted by the Commission with regard to Roma. I understand the pragmatic approach free of any political and ideological implications, an approach – as President Barroso said at the summit held in Brussels on 16 September – which needs all leaders to be involved, without exclusion, from the Roma community to the public authorities, headed by the European Commission. Policies on Roma certainly come under the remit of Member States, but it is a good thing that they are finally being coordinated at Community level. Good practices should be coordinated and the use of funds be monitored on a regular basis. How many resources have been squandered over the last few years? How many opportunities have been lost? Looking at the real situation and taking account of proper exceptions, the budget is unfortunately in deficit. Too many funds have not been used, too many have been wasted on measures and projects which have produced no results. If we want to be serious about this, we cannot pretend that this has not happened. In this respect, we can really say: ‘whoever is without sin, cast the first stone’. The Commission has produced a useful document for Member States. Everyone must now do their bit, starting off by relentlessly combating every form of racism and discrimination and advocating serious integration policies, which will primarily have three priority areas: education, vaccinations and health care, as well as professional training and work start programmes, also using micro-credit funds. But we should ask the Roma people to assume their responsibilities. Just let me give you an example. We must absolutely stop tolerating Roma parents forcing their children to beg, taking them out of educational activities to do so. Exploitation and illegal activities cannot be tolerated at all in any form. It is only by combining solidarity, integration and respect for regulations that we can find the right strategy for resolving these problems.
 Roberta Angelilli,

 Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I would like to thank the Commission, the French Presidency and my fellow MEPs, first and foremost the draftsmen of the opinions, for their hard work in drafting a compromise text at first reading that will enable the ‘Safer Internet’ programme to enter into force at the planned time, that is from 1 January 2009. The new programme for children using the Internet and other communication technologies, as we know, will be based on four main lines of action: reducing illegal or harmful content and combating harmful online behaviour; promoting a safer online environment, including through ad hoc
 technological instruments; information, participation and prevention to raise public awareness of the opportunities and risks associated with the use of online technologies; and, lastly, establishing a knowledge base to encourage cooperation and exchanges of good practice and information at international level. The statistics speak for themselves, as Commissioner Reding is well aware: the age at which children access the Internet has dropped considerably. From as early as the age of 9 or 10, children are going online several times a week, and 75% of 12- to 15-year-olds in Europe use the Internet for roughly three hours a day, communicating through chat services, messaging and social networking sites. The aim of the programme is not, of course, to criminalise the Internet in a catastrophic vision of new technologies; quite the contrary. Our objective is to provide suitable tools to better understand and navigate the world of new technologies, to grasp fully their positive potential, the opportunities they offer in terms of information, education and socialisation, while at the same time learning to protect oneself against abuse. For we cannot ignore the latest figures showing that 30% of young people have had at least one distasteful encounter online, at least one unpleasant experience in which the child has come across pornographic content, offensive or violent messages of various kinds or sexual advances or even content inciting violence or self-harm, suicide, anorexia or bulimia. We cannot ignore the exponential increase in sites with child pornography material. We cannot fail to consider the data supplied by Interpol reporting that at least 500 000 new original child pornography images are put online each year. The Committee has also done well to highlight, among other things, three new trends: ‘grooming’, that is, the online soliciting of children through psychological manipulation aimed at contact in real life. ‘Grooming’ is particularly insidious because the advances appear to be ‘softer’. No explicit sexual demands are made at first. The child is led on by the affectionate and confidential behaviour; not understanding the danger, they enjoy the exclusive relationship that develops, and so do not discuss it with anyone, least of all with their parents. It is therefore a highly dangerous situation because it is not perceived as such, and often ends in a meeting in person and in real abuse. Another priority is ‘cyberbullying’, a form of bullying using the new technologies, in which the persecution of the victim is extended as they risk being tormented 24 hours a day via the web and mobile phones. And there is yet another problem: the technological gap between the generations. We have a generation of children born in the digital era – children who at five years old are competent users of videogames and can surf the Internet easily – and adults, their parents and teachers, many of whom do not even know how to turn on a computer or send a text message, or who use new technologies warily and with reluctance. It is therefore absolutely essential to narrow this gap. The programme’s objectives are ambitious, perhaps too ambitious given the available budget of EUR 55 million, but it is nonetheless a good starting point. As usual, Parliament has sought to provide a stimulus, with pioneering proposals that I will not go into now as they are in my report and I am almost out of time. I would like to conclude, Mr President, by emphasising that our obligation, both Parliament’s and – I am convinced of this – the Commission’s obligation, is never to let down our guard on these matters.
 Roberta Angelilli,

 Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I would like to thank the Commissioner; she has given us important assurances, including the fact that the Commission and Commissioner Barrot intend to find a legally binding definition for ‘grooming’, a common definition for all Member States. In my view this is undoubtedly a very important objective. I believe that this programme, clearly, cannot solve all the problems, not least because it is just a programme, it has legal limitations and budgetary restrictions, obviously. That said, it is evident from the debate that the European Parliament wishes to be active in combating harmful online content. The aim for the future is also to improve the coordination of action against this content at European level, making available best practices, measures that have enjoyed the most success, and sharing information and methods. In my opinion, international cooperation must be continually increased in this sector that, as other Members have said, is a sector that knows no borders. We therefore need to move towards sharing data and information in real time. Parliament wants to remain at the forefront in this area. We have many proposals, some of which have been mentioned by my fellow Members: the idea of a ‘child-friendly’ mark, the role of ‘hotlines’ and of police forces working to prevent and combat online abuse, but also the need to implement initiatives in the area of self-regulation by mobile phone operators and service providers. In addition, I believe that we need to work towards tracing financial transactions linked to the exchange of images of child pornography. I share the Commissioner’s view: information and education campaigns involving not only children but also adults, parents and teachers, not for the purpose of criminalising new technologies – because they are vitally important – are essential for European children.

 Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I have an oral amendment at the beginning of paragraph 25. I wish to add the following words: ‘condemns every act of violence against Christian communities and’, and then the original text follows.

 Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I should like to begin by complimenting the rapporteur on her excellent work. I am obviously about to repeat many of the remarks already made by my colleagues, but I do not think that we should mince our words: obesity affects approximately 25% of European children and is therefore a serious threat to their future health. The causes include inadequate information, poor eating habits, a lack of physical activity and even a shortage of sports facilities. Nor should we underestimate the social and psychological problems involved, partly because overweight children are often victims of bullying. I believe, for this reason, that the proposed increase in funding for the school fruit programme, whereby fruit and vegetables are made available free of charge in the classroom, is a good idea. Indeed, 2009 should see a revival of the Mediterranean diet and the production of fruit and vegetables, especially in view of the latest WHO data indicating that the consumption of these foods is falling even in Mediterranean countries. Under this initiative, rather than being destroyed to keep prices high, fruit will be used to ensure a healthier diet, especially for our children, and therefore a healthier future for Europe's citizens.

 Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I speak in favour of Mr Weber’s proposal and I would like to thank Commissioner Barrot, not only for what he has said today in this House, but also for his commitment to resolving, in the best and most constructive way, a situation that in Italy should be recognised for what it is, namely an emergency involving thousands of people. I assure you that thousands of minors are living in conditions of total neglect, with no right to medical treatment, vaccinations or schooling. It seems to me that the Commission and the Italian Government are working together… – Mr President, may I finish speaking? May I continue or must I stop speaking? Would you please remind the House that I have the right to speak? – I was saying that the Commission and the Government are going in the right direction and in particular I believe that we should not vote on a resolution that is full of inaccuracies, actual errors from a legal point of view, i.e. full of legal falsehoods. It is therefore an entirely political resolution, with no basis in fact. Among other things, I would like to remind the House – and I am reaching my conclusion – that, while Commissioner Barrot has been extremely clear today, three days ago Commissioner Špidla said that he had yet to read the act, which I believe consists of no more than two pages. Therefore if those on the left must at all costs make a premature judgment on a government’s methods, I believe it to be entirely illegitimate.

 Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, this debate gives me the opportunity to put some questions to the left, which has had the clever idea of using the European Parliament, for the umpteenth time, to pass judgment in a totally inappropriate, specious and premature manner on the application of an Italian act that is still at the preparatory stage. First question, then: where was the left, which has governed in Italy for decades, when these illegal camps were set up and proliferated in conditions totally lacking in the most basic health and safety standards? I would also like to ask you if your silence over all these years does not bear you down, like a ball and chain, fashioned of indifference and hypocrisy, of looking the other way, when you obviously had no eyes – nor much political interest – to see that dozens of children were dying of cold or burns every year because of the lack of safety in these shanty towns. Perhaps you are not even interested to know that in Rome, where nearly 7 000 minors live, millions of euros have been earmarked for schooling: wasted schooling, since last year only 25% of these children regularly attended school. Who knows whether you know or pretend not to know that this schooling was entrusted, almost as a monopoly, to a few associations that were motivated not so much by the best interests of minors as by the availability of public money. I uphold the right of the Roma people to have a census, as happens regularly for all Italian citizens, because the census guarantees the right to health, social inclusion and integration into the school system. I also uphold the right of the Roma community to identity checks. Obviously there are no plans for any widespread measure: anyone whose papers are in order will not be checked. However, a child who is not registered at birth or who has no recognisable identity, becomes an invisible child, easy prey for any kind of exploitation: organ trafficking, illegal adoption, sexual exploitation and under-age working. This applies to all minors living in Italy: Italians, and EU and non-EU citizens alike. Finally, a few words about the title of your oral questions. Not only does the act make no mention of ethnic groups, but there are no plans for a specific database, especially not a Roma fingerprints database. Better proposals are always welcome of course: we are open to constructive proposals. However, we will not be lectured by anyone who year after year has failed to lift a finger to resolve a serious social emergency.

 Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, making expulsions secure and discouraging illegality and exploitation: that, in brief, is, in my view, the aim of the ‘return’ directive. I would therefore like to congratulate the rapporteur on his excellent work, which laid the groundwork for the compromise reached with the Council. The text is balanced, and is based on some fundamental assumptions: finally giving ourselves a common immigration policy. We have been talking about it for a long time – too long. It means equipping ourselves with common rules, which are vital for fully protecting the rights of legal immigrants, who constitute a very positive resource, provided that an implacable line is taken against illegal immigration. There are some other distinctive points that I particularly wish to stress: in the first instance, voluntary return is promoted; faster deadlines are set for return in the case of risk of escape or danger posed by the individual and, above all, a fixed timetable is finally laid down for the period for staying in detention centres in order for all the requisite checks to be made. This is not an insignificant achievement. I would like to point out that, up until now – as many of my fellow Members have already said – every Member State was free to decide whether or not to impose a time restriction on length of stay. Also, special attention should be paid to human rights, particularly for vulnerable individuals and especially for minors, on the grounds of the best interest of the child. This is a revolutionary point, that takes due account of what actually happens in detention centres. Finally, the ban on re-entry valid throughout the EU: I see these as common, fair and transparent rules that could form part of a strategy, or of a pact for integration as the next President-in-Office of the EU has termed it, that would see controls at the Union’s external borders stepped up, that would draw up a new policy on asylum, that would give renewed impetus to diplomatic collaboration, but also and above all to development cooperation with third countries. Finally, on a European code for the integration of legal immigrants, Europe should shoulder its responsibilities, it should be authoritative and credible, it should become a Europe of rights and rules that are complied with. We have a duty to adopt this text which, of course, could be further improved. Everything can be improved upon. In any event, the Member States can do so, but after three years it would be awful to block it for further months or years, in order to find another, infinitesimal compromise that in any case would always be considered a step backwards. While we live in our golden world, which is actually made up of infinite compromises, there are so many people who are being exploited, who are dying in cruel and inhuman ways, as happened yesterday in Italy. Let us, please, have more responsibility and fewer words!

 Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, I would like to thank the rapporteur for the excellent work she has done to identify very clearly the current political, social and administrative situation in Turkey. Regardless of whether one’s position on the accession of Turkey to the European Union is positive, lukewarm or downright hostile, there can be no argument that Turkey lags way behind in terms of modernisation and human rights. Admittedly, some efforts have been made, but corruption is a genuine blight and the Cyprus issue remains unresolved, not to mention the fact that there is a lot of work to do in relations with the Armenians. There is the Kurdish question, violence against women is still a sore point and the same is true for forced marriages and honour crimes. Also cause for concern is the situation regarding registration of births and low levels of schooling. This list is certainly not exhaustive and gives a snapshot of a very difficult situation which Parliament must continue to monitor very carefully and steadfastly. There can be no compromise on freedom and basic rights … (The President cut off the speaker)

 Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, I too would like to clear up any misunderstanding. Any act of violence and discrimination must be condemned in no uncertain terms, but we need to consider the situation, and especially to avoid hypocrisy or, even worse, political exploitation. I am sorry to be so blunt, but I would like to cast a veil over the attempts made by many in this Chamber today to place the blame for the current Roma situation in Italy on Silvio Berlusconi. Perhaps Mr Veltroni and Mr Bassolino know more about blame, especially when it comes to the squalor in illegal Romany camps. I would, however, ask everyone to make an effort to act responsibly and in earnest, which we now need after all the delays and calls for a solution which have fallen on deaf ears. We need to redouble our efforts and to stand up for the people living in the Romany camps in conditions that are absolutely inhumane and unacceptable; we need to forget the mother whose baby was almost abducted and the family of Mrs Reggiani, raped and killed just under a year ago, sadly a case that has occupied this Parliament. Our proposals, which we have been making for years, are clear: they were incorporated into both the last European Parliament resolution on the situation of the Roma in the European Union, and into the European strategy on the rights of the child. One: solve the problem of Romany camps, where health and safety is non-existent; two: propose drastic measures, such as the loss of parental authority, for those parents who force their children into begging, prostitution and child labour; three: lower the school drop-out rate among Roma children, which is 75% in some Member States; four: make better use of Community funds available for all citizens of Roma origin who work, who want to be integrated and who send their children to school, but at the same time isolate and repatriate habitual offenders. Finally, I make this appeal to the entire European Union, given that the problem concerns all Member States, as the Council of Europe, among others, recently pointed out with regret.

Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I would particularly like to compliment the rapporteur on his excellent work. This report achieves a twofold objective: it reinforces measures to combat smoking by extending the financing of the European Tobacco Fund whilst at the same time bringing the tobacco sector into line with the other CMOs which will naturally terminate with the 2012 financial year. However, the fight against smoking must not mean the end of tobacco growing in Europe, because Europe is the world’s leading importer of raw tobacco and relies for over 75% of its requirements on third countries, to the benefit of tobaccos often produced without any guaranteed health controls. Any cancellation of the aid would lead merely to the end of production, to increased imports and would have no effect on smoking.

 Mr President, I wanted to remove the words 'traditional practices' from the oral amendment, that is, the last two words of paragraph 9.

Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, this morning the report on an EU strategy on the rights of the child was adopted. One of its priorities is combating poverty and discrimination. On this point, we decided to devote a special paragraph to Roma children, who are often excluded from health and social provision and from schooling. It is a well-known fact that a very high percentage of Roma children do not go to school, or attend only occasionally. Many Roma children are actually forced to attend special schools, if not institutions for the disabled. Available data show that in some Member States early school leaving by Roma children exceeds 60%. It is clear that children who do not go to school, who are illiterate or in any case have an inadequate level of education or vocational training, are children who have no future, but are forced to beg or to work on the black market. In any case, their fate is sealed: in the best-case scenario they will be condemned to poverty and social exclusion, while in the worst-case scenario they will be victims of organised crime. It is worth bearing in mind, by the way, that the Roma population is very young, with approximately 45% of individuals aged under 16; for this very reason it would be extremely useful and important for the Commission to lay down specific, concrete actions for Roma children, particularly with reference to combating early school leaving and the promotion of appropriate, high-quality schooling. Without a right to education there is no guarantee of equal treatment and, above all, no right to a future.

Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, first I want to thank colleagues for their valuable cooperation, and in particular Mr Frattini for his commitment since the beginning of his mandate to safeguard the rights of the child. The report obviously does not pretend to be exhaustive, but I believe it is a good point of departure. The objective was to lay the bases for a strategy aimed at promoting and safeguarding the rights of minors in the European Union’s internal and external policies and to support Member States’ efforts in that sector. We wanted to take as our premise the specific nature of the rights of minors, which are totally distinct from the more general category of fundamental rights, although they form an integral part of them. The strategy aims above all at the positive affirmation of the rights of the child, which include the right to a family, the right to health, education, social inclusion, but also the right to entertainment, the right to play, to engage in sport, together with the right to a clean and protected environment. In substance, the aim is to create a society tailored to the child, in which the child can feel protected and actively involved. That is why the report is based on two main presumptions: (1) active participation of children in decision-making that affects them; (2) mainstreaming, that is to say incorporating and promoting the rights of the child in all European Union policies. In short, the rights of minors must finally become a political priority for Europe, given also that children account for about 30% of European citizens and much still remains to be done for them, beginning with the fight against violence and abuse, in face of the worrying growth of paedophilia and child pornography networks. The general objective is to ban all forms of violence, including so-called traditional practices, honour crimes, and forced marriages. It is not enough only to ensure the certain punishment of those who commit violence; we must guarantee a strategy of prevention, aimed especially at helping children at risk. Another priority is to combat child poverty. It is worth pointing out that even within the European Union 19% of children live below the poverty line and we must, therefore, provide aid measures that are also designed to support their families. In particular, we need measures targeted at Roma children and street children, who are often forced to beg and thus become easy victims of exploitation, trafficking and organised crime. Another basic aspect of the strategy is to guarantee the education and training of all children, including the most poor and disadvantaged. We also need measures targeted at the less able, so as to prevent any form of discrimination. We are among experts here so perhaps there is no need in this Chamber to list all the urgent problems that need to be tackled: from the marketing of violent video games to the rise in cases of international kidnapping of minors, the red tape that makes international adoptions difficult, the tragedy of the child soldiers, child labour, the failure to register the birth of a child, the remarkable number of disappeared children of which no more is ever heard. I could go on and on. In truth, we must apply the appropriate instruments and provide prompt information in order to exchange experiences and good practice, and we must create synergy between the related legal and penal instruments in order to address the problems in concrete terms and in real time and possibly succeed in preventing them. Let me conclude by saying that approval of the Lisbon Treaty will give us a few more chances. The EU Charter of Fundamental Rights now forms part of the Treaty, including, therefore, Article 24, which expressly governs the rights of the child, thus creating a legal basis for implementing the strategy. At this point, we as a Parliament, but above all the Member States, must set to work immediately.

Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, first of all let me once again thank Commissioner Frattini for reiterating the European Commission’s serious commitment to the sector of the rights of the child. I thank him also for calling on Member States, in his opening statement, rapidly to activate the child helplines, for the delays here are indeed unjustifiable. I am also grateful to him for pointing out that not all Member States have to date introduced a national guarantee in relation to the rights of the child, something we also noted and deplored in the report. I am also grateful to all my colleagues who played a part in the drafting of this document, and to those who have spoken, for I believe we are all agreed on the concept of the higher interest of the child. Obviously, I support that and share the concerns that have been expressed in the Chamber today. We must force our Member States to move more quickly from words to deeds and obviously Parliament and the European Commission must do their part too. Let me say a few brief words on some of the issues that were highlighted. On the environment, let me confirm to Mr Frattini that it is true that we could perhaps have done more in the report, but we did make it clear that the right to a healthy and clean environment must be one of the main rights guaranteed to minors. I was pleased to find that one of the issues that will be addressed at the next European Forum on the rights of the child will be the question of international adoptions. In that context I also want to point out that aside from the enormous and often entirely bureaucratic difficulties of international adoptions, there also is the tragedy of children who are fought over by their parents following separation or divorce. That is indeed a major European problem, which has obviously also grown as a result of opening up borders. Let me conclude by saying that I am of course very pleased with the work that has been done, and although I believe the result is certainly not perfect, it can be a very good point of departure provided, I repeat, that serious and responsible practical action is taken promptly.

 Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, the current waste crisis in Campania is a tragedy that has long been coming, and those mountains of refuse that can be seen in the streets are only the tip of an iceberg made up of inefficiency, waste and mismanagement. We are unhappy that this crisis is damaging the reputation not just of the Region of Campania but of Italy as a whole, but keeping quiet again about who is responsible and turning a blind eye would do little to resolve a problem which has worsened because of silence and intrigue, and although people should not used as political pawns, nor do I think that the do-gooder attitude that is also creeping round this House this evening is acceptable either. We can no longer stay silent or justify, and neither did the Court of Auditors, the fact that millions of euro, of European, national and local funds have gone up in smoke. To whom should people turn for compensation for the damages caused by this environmental disaster, for the tarnished image and for the waste of public resources? In particular, what action does the Commission intend to take actively to force the Italian State to take adequate measures, bearing in mind that the children of Naples and Campania have not gone to school today either?

 Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, there can be no concessions on toy safety and the mass withdrawal from the market of toys from China has put consumer safety back at the centre of the debate, particularly the safety of our smallest consumers, who often do not have the voice or the strength to defend themselves. There is, in fact, a very profitable market in products that are a health hazard, a market that makes staggering amounts of money each year and that finds endless routes and subterfuges for legalising what is in reality illegal and harmful. For this very reason, we welcome the Commission’s proposals to strengthen the application of checks on the safety of products, especially toys. In particular, we believe cooperation with China and the United States is of fundamental importance in blocking the flow of dangerous products heading for the European market. A number of actions, such as an overall examination of safety measures and the safety pact between producers and importers, must be prioritised in order to restore consumer confidence. As regards the Member States, it is fundamentally important to improve cooperation between customs and the authorities responsible for controlling the markets. A revision of the toy safety directive is essential, so that there are definite rules for planning adequate checks at the production and customs stages. I will finish, however, by saying that China absolutely must play its part and the Commission must demand that it does so. China must give guarantees, and must engage in a hard and uncompromising fight against illegal practices, otherwise the European Union will have to take serious measures and close the door on counterfeiting and unfair and unlawful competition.

Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, flexicurity is neither a panacea nor a taboo subject. We just have to agree on the rules of the game. It goes without saying that Europe must be equal to the challenges of globalisation and competition – not always fair competition – forced upon us by the world economy. All of this requires flexibility, but that does not mean turning our backs on the European social model, its values, its standards of security and above all its solidarity. Flexibility is therefore acceptable on condition that there are firm rules, guarantees and compensatory mechanisms in place. Most importantly, Europe must lead the Member States in a strategy comprising certain key ingredients: a decent level of continuing training, adequate welfare measures, quality services beginning with childcare services, and social security systems to support workers during periods of inactivity. Such support, incidentally, need not necessarily take the form of handouts; it could also be the provision of opportunities to acquire the skills required for new jobs on offer. Finally, there must be measures for reconciling work and family life, to enable women in particular to enjoy truly equal opportunities in the world of work. Naturally, these objectives necessitate a substantial amount of funding, but only in this way can flexicurity be an opportunity rather than a shortcut towards deregulation of the world of work.

 Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I would also like to thank Commissioner Frattini for his detailed report this afternoon. In my opinion, Directive 2004/38/EC is a valid point of reference, guaranteeing full affirmation of the right of movement of EU citizens, avoiding any form of discrimination and establishing the principle of full integration. This directive is essentially concerned with protecting the rights of someone residing in a Member State, as well as the rights of citizens of that Member State, in keeping with the principle of reciprocity. It offers maximum protection for people working, studying and wanting to become integrated, but comes down hard on those people who break the rules. It is on this latter point that Parliament must have a real discussion. Not only are there rights, there are also duties and rules which must be respected. We cannot continue to ignore the fact that there is a percentage – no doubt an absolute minority, but this percentage does exist – of people who travel to other Member States and who have no intention of reporting their presence to the host Member States, simply because they do not want to be officially recognised, because they have no intention of abiding by the laws and working legally. We need to address properly the problem of who moves to and who enters a Member State, intent on remaining on the fringes of society. No doubt the tools can be improved, but some of them are already available to the Member States under Directive 2004/38/EC. This is why first we must call for the prompt, full, thorough and concrete application of the Directive in each Member State. Perhaps it might also be worth refining the Directive, not only imposing an obligation on visitors to declare their presence in the territory of the host Member State on certain terms, but an obligation on the Member State to impose sanctions on anyone who does not abide by the rules. In Italy for example, the decree implementing the directive sets forth certain terms and conditions, but it does not provide any sanctions, so the law is in fact completely ineffectual. Above all, we need to make sure that immigrants are escorted back to their own country, obviously in cases where there are genuine reasons for doing so. However, I should point out that anyone who commits a crime, anyone who violates human rights, because this is also important, who exploits children, who exploits women or who represents a threat to public safety, must be removed and returned in no uncertain terms to the authorities in his or her country of origin. We also need laws for people who do not work, for people who have a hand-to-mouth existence and who can thus represent an excessive burden for the community of the host Member State. I would like to finish by mentioning the Roma children and making the case for Italy. There are around 50,000 children, or rather at least 50,000 exploited children in Italy. They are of Roma origin, they are forced to beg, they are not vaccinated, they do not go to school and they live in absolutely deplorable sanitary conditions. I would like to remind everyone that around a week before Mrs Reggiani was killed in Rome, in the same shanty town as the one in which Mrs Reggiani’s killer lived, a two-month-old Roma child died of cold. This was in Rome, one of Europe’s foremost capital cities. Therefore, I will finish by asking, is this truly integration? Is this respect for human rights? We have a duty to ask serious questions without hypocrisy and we have a duty to say that everyone is equal before the law.

 Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I should firstly like to thank our colleague for her work. As the European Parliament’s rapporteur on the rights of minors, I should like to focus on an important part of this report, that is the part on Roma children. I should like to remind everyone here that it is children who suffer the worst problems of discrimination and social exclusion. In Europe there are many, too many street children, often from Roma backgrounds, who have no future because they have not had a proper school education and in many cases are completely illiterate. These children do not receive proper medical care or the necessary vaccinations. They are consequently children who do not have a future, because they have been denied their childhood and because they are often forced to beg, to collect handouts, almost always during school hours, or end up in illegal work. As the report also says, the Member States have to commit themselves to introducing positive policies against discrimination. In this particular case, policies that guarantee children’s entitlement to an education and that require the families of these Roma children to make sure that they attend compulsory education. Suitable campaigns also need to be run to encourage citizens to work with schools to prevent instances of discrimination, exploitation and social exclusion among children. I would also conclude by saying that it is unacceptable that too many Member States, unfortunately including my own country, Italy, have yet properly to transpose the provisions of the Directive into national law.

 Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I should firstly like to congratulate Mr Foglietta for his excellent work: his report very effectively tackles a tragically topical issue, that of alcohol abuse, in particular by minors. It has already been said that the aim is in no way to criminalise consumption of alcohol which, when taken in moderate quantities, may well have health benefits. The aim is rather to take a strong line against the spread of alcohol consumption among the very young. Alcohol is often taken with drugs or alcohol itself may end up as a drug. Alcohol abuse is now a social emergency among young people because it brings with it very serious physical and psychological damage, not to mention the victims of road accidents which are increasingly being caused by drink-drivers. In Europe, Italy is sadly in the lead here with the highest number of road traffic accidents, half of whose victims are young people aged under thirty. In the majority of cases, they lose their lives at weekends, during the evening, during the night, often returning from a party or a discotheque after consuming excessive amounts of alcohol. In conclusion, Mr President, this is an excellent report, whose line we support as it is capable of reconciling prevention of the problem with appropriate action in terms of education and information and with zero tolerance for those failing to abide by the rules.

Mr Prodi, I am making my speech on behalf of the Union for Europe of the Nations Group which, I would like to remind Mr Prodi, represents the fourth-largest political group in the European Parliament. I would like to re-emphasise something: Europe is very close to our hearts! Mr Fini, the chairman of the party that I represent, was one of those in the Convention who contributed enthusiastically to the current draft Constitution. More generally, we Italians have a long and uninterrupted European tradition, and therefore cannot but support the appeal made a few months ago in this very Chamber by Mr Napolitano, President of the Italian Republic, who called for the Constitution to be adopted as soon as possible. One of the reasons why this Constitution is necessary is so that we can have a common foreign policy. Mr Prodi, you were right in pointing to the common foreign policy that we so sorely miss, especially at this time of international crisis. I would like to take the opportunity, on this point, to thank all those throughout the world who are working on peace-keeping missions, particularly in Afghanistan, Lebanon and Palestine, starting with the approximately 8 000 Italians. These are important missions, strongly supported by all the Italian political parties, even though, to be truthful, Mr Prodi, there are some embarrassing exceptions in your governing majority. I would like to go back to the Constitution, to express a regret and a wish. The regret is that it has not been possible to mention Europe’s Christian roots in the text; the wish is that the goal of swift adoption of the Constitution will be achieved. I am convinced that Italy, as usual, will play its part well.

 Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I should like to thank Mr Janowski and Mr Andria for the excellent work they have done. I particularly value their commitment to a more appropriate housing policy. In fact, it is worth remembering that housing is an outright emergency, above all in the large European cities, where the cost of housing is extremely high and forces families to spend over 50% of their earnings on a mortgage or on rent. This is despite the fact that housing should be a primary need and therefore a basic social right. I hope that we are setting out along the path of upgrading public housing, which in many cases is actually crumbling to pieces, and, more generally, embarking on a strategy of regenerating the underprivileged urban areas in the large European cities.

Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, as an Italian, I would like to mention that worldwide Italy is the fourth-ranked producer of organic products, while in the European Union it is in first place. We therefore endorse the changes made by this report to the regulation: the changes regarding its scope, flexibility for the Member States, checks and the free movement of organic products within the European Union. With regard to labelling, on the other hand, we believe that there must be an absolute guarantee that products are organic and that therefore there must be no accidental contamination by GMOs at any stage of the production process. The regulations in force allow a threshold of accidental contamination by GMOs of 0.9% for organic products, which unfortunately is equal to that laid down for conventional agricultural products. To conclude, in order to avoid a collapse in consumption as a result of a crisis in trust concerning foods chosen and purchased precisely because of their characteristics and their natural methods of production, it is necessary to lay down a threshold of accidental contamination by GMOs for organic products.

 Wine, for those who have been making it for centuries, is not just a beverage like any other to be marketed solely with a view to profit: it is a choice based on history, culture, respect and a quest for quality – often a quest for excellence. Italy, the number one wine exporter in the world, has made high quality its banner, together with respect for consumers and the traditions of wine-making. This report is schizophrenic: on the one hand it talks about promoting quality, while on the other it comes down in favour of enrichment with sugar; on the one hand it talks about protecting geographical designations, while on the other it opens the door to new wine-making practices, such as wine with shavings. The European Commission has, in any case, often taken a similar line; for years it has preferred brutal liberalisation and large-scale distribution, at the expense of quality, tradition and the protection of consumers and producers. Just to give an example, I would like to point to Regulation (EC) No 316/2004 which liberalised 17 traditional designations, in reality opening up the market to wine-making piracy. For all these reasons, while I voted in favour of the report, I would like to express great concern for the future of the high quality of the wine-making sector, particularly the Italian sector.

Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, I truly wish you all the very best for your first day as President. However, there is still a great deal left to do where women’s rights are concerned; we have a long history of parliamentary work behind us, and it is precisely for that reason that we recognise how increasingly important it is to ensure that gender-related aspects are genuinely integrated into the work of the committees, and integrated in an effective and operational manner. If we look at the reality of the situation, there are many problems to be resolved, and the figures are quite clear: it is still exceedingly difficult for women to enter and participate in political and institutional life, and that is without mentioning the endless unresolved problems they have in actually reconciling their working lives with their family lives. That is precisely why, if we are to attempt to do away with the inequalities, we need to intervene openly in every action and policy carried out by the Union. Furthermore, the rapporteur − whom I thank for her excellent work – has done well to highlight the fact that there is still not a suitable culture encouraging women to participate in political life. I should like to give an example: in Italy there is no law on the so-called pink quotas, and, personally, I am not convinced that quotas are necessarily the best system. However, in Italy, parties that have freely decided to include more women on their lists of candidates, such as the party to which I belong, have actually seen an increase in the number of female politicians represented in parliament, and this is a positive development − it is an example of good practice that should be exported, nay, imposed at Community level. To conclude, I expect all the Community institutions and, in particular, the German Presidency, to put women back in the spotlight and to launch a genuine European family pact.

 Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I should like to thank Mr Frattini very much for the highly practical proposals that he has put forward this evening. There is no doubt that Europe is seeing a worrying and exponential growth in cases of violence, bullying and violence among children, and television and the Internet are undeniably affecting the way our children behave, as is the spread of violent videogames, which are becoming increasingly common and increasingly brutal. I shall just give you one example: there is a very recent videogame called Rule of Rose
, which is a really serious problem in that the main characters in the game are children, and many of the images are on the borderline of sexual perversion and sadism. We therefore warmly welcome the current debate, even though – as the President has mentioned – it has been tucked away in an evening slot and has very few participants. That is a real shame. Even so, we expect some sort of action to be taken in this matter, and certainly not through censorship, as Commissioner Reding has already said. We support your initiative, Mr Frattini, of sending a letter to the EU Home Affairs Ministers asking them to carry out a careful check on the controls that exist regarding videogame violence. After what Mrs Reding said, we hope that the PEGI (Pan-European Game Information) system will really become a body able to exercise more effective control. To conclude, we strongly call for practical measures to be developed to control and prohibit the distribution of violent videogames and to set up a kind of European monitoring centre for childhood and young people, not least so as to carry out preventive monitoring of game and videogame content and, if possible, to draw up a single code for the marketing and distribution of videogames for children.

Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, if Europe is to support growth and employment, it needs to expand the market and eliminate the excessive bureaucratic red tape that exists in this sector. However, this must not prejudice workers' rights or lead to exploitation or social dumping. Despite the fact that, after a hard-fought parliamentary battle, a series of socially important services have been excluded from the original directive, the text on which we are about to vote remains ambiguous and still does not clearly set the boundary between this directive and labour law and national social safeguards. Despite this morning’s reassurances, it is for these reasons that we call for the directive, when it is actually implemented, to respect national conciliation practices and not to bypass sector-wide collective agreements. Above all, we call for the application of the directive to be strictly monitored, so that the rules protecting employee and consumer rights and health and safety at work are not breached.

Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I should like to begin by congratulating the rapporteur on the excellent work she has done, and in particular on the fact that she has highlighted some important priorities enabling us to ensure that immigration is primarily understood as two-way integration – therefore involving social, linguistic and cultural aspects – that is to say integration based on mutual respect for rights and duties. Among the main rights that must be guaranteed to women migrants is that of preventing and combating honour crimes, forced marriages, genital mutilation or any other form of violent constraint and exploitation. In this regard, I, on behalf of my group, have tabled an amendment highlighting the need to carry out extensive information campaigns aimed precisely at women migrants, so that they can be informed of their rights and of the bodies that they can turn in times of need. Finally, the European Union needs at last to adopt specific provisions to encourage the Member States, too, to draft laws explicitly prohibiting some of the crimes and issues about which we have already spoken. To conclude, I should like to thank Mr Frattini for the commitment that he has emphasised this evening, too, a commitment that the Commission intends to put to use in addressing these problems.

Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, it is well known that, in recent years, the European Union has become China’s second most important trading partner. It is therefore becoming crucial to clarify the relations that exist between our continent and China, so as to do the best possible job of tackling future global challenges, even though I believe that there are still too many critical points to be highlighted. Despite being part of the WTO, China has often shown that it does not observe the rules shared by its other trading partners. As we have denounced all too often up to now, China is placing goods on the European markets that are counterfeit or that do not comply with EU legislation, with quality and safety standards. China does not adequately comply with the TRIPS agreements on the protection of intellectual property rights and inventions and does not help its foreign partners to access its markets. The trade agreements on footwear, textiles and clothing must also be reviewed with the utmost urgency, as unacceptable imbalances still exist. What are even more worrying are the problems relating to human rights and, more specifically, the rights of women and children; the absence in many cases of minimum health and safety standards in the workplace; and even the existence of labour camps. These are unfortunately all prominent issues, but it is time to identify the solutions and, above all, the specific means for more incisively tackling the unfair competition and the social and environmental dumping practised by China. To conclude, it is worth hoping that the Finnish Presidency can finally take upon itself the role of champion of the real interests of European citizens, consumers and producers, and that includes during the forthcoming EU-China summit being held in a few days’ time.

 Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, first of all I should like to congratulate Mrs Gröner and all my fellow Members who have worked on this report. I also thank the Commissioner for his support and his words this morning. I am convinced that important results can be achieved when everyone collaborates, and they have been achieved in this case. Above all, the continuity of the Daphne programme has been guaranteed; this is an important, valuable programme for preventing and fighting violence towards women and children, which has already in the past obtained significant and to some extent unexpected results. In addition, the programme has been guaranteed an ad hoc
 budget line that is rightly separate, as the rapporteur also said, from the drugs prevention programme. It is worth mentioning that, out of all the possible aims of Daphne, a number of important priorities have also been set, including the fight against domestic violence – worryingly, a problem that is constantly on the increase – and the scourge of genital mutilation. Another important point has been to specify that the term ‘child’ or ‘young person’ covers the age range from newborn to 18 years, although the measures may of course target young people up to the age of 25. There has also been a concern to specify that violence prevention should be aimed not only at young people, women and groups at risk, but also at newborn babies: cases in which babies are mistreated or actually abandoned are growing exponentially and are often associated with situations of psychological and social deprivation. Such occurrences could be prevented by providing mothers and families in extreme difficulties with assistance and support. Clearly, these are ambitious aims for which, unfortunately, there is inadequate financial provision. In conclusion, I hope that Daphne may be allocated greater resources than at present in the mid-term budget review; we are counting on your efforts as well, Commissioner, to achieve that.

Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, we are following the situation in the Holy Land with anxiety and anguish. It is a situation that is becoming more serious by the day and one that is in danger of turning into an international crisis and, even before that, into a humanitarian crisis. I think that it is only right to begin with the words of the Pope, who has launched an appeal for the release of all of the kidnap victims and for negotiations to be held between Israelis and Palestinians, with the decisive contribution of the international community, and especially of Europe, in favour of a restoration of peace. At this tragic time, in fact, only dialogue and a cessation of the hostilities by both parties can stop the unacceptable escalation of violence. We welcomed the agreement between Fatah and Hamas on the prisoners’ document, which implicitly acknowledges Israel’s existence, but much more progress needs to be made, starting with the release of the Israeli soldier. Europe has done well to launch an immediate appeal, with one voice, for moderation and peace, but more courage and more determination are required. The international community must genuinely take the lead and assume full responsibility for becoming the guarantor of peace in the Middle East, by putting a stop to the violence and bringing Israelis and Palestinians back to the negotiating table. To conclude, I should like once again to cite the Pope, who has reaffirmed Israel's legitimate right to exist, in peace, but who has subsequently appealed for the international community to genuinely support the people of Palestine so that they can overcome the precarious conditions in which they are living and can build a future for themselves, with the ultimate aim of building an actual State. We are sure that, if these words could be heard, it would be possible at last to re-embark on the road to dialogue and peace.

 Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, first of all I congratulate the rapporteurs, because we welcome the seventh framework programme. At last, we have the first practical and effective instrument for revitalising European competitiveness at a global level and an important stimulus for investment in innovation to support European businesses, especially small and medium-sized enterprises. This is a first step on the way to achieving the Lisbon objectives, about which there has been a lot of talk so far, but very little has been accomplished. Indeed, for the sake of Europe’s growth and development, it is crucial to finance programmes directed at technological development and scientific research. That is also why it is essential that the programme should aim at enhancing human resources and especially at encouraging young people to take up a career in research, thus preventing the brain drain. It must be made clear, however, that the seventh framework programme must under no circumstances fund research into human cloning, genetic mutations or the use of embryonic stem cells. We have therefore signed some amendments that clarify how the funds are to be spent, in accordance with national legislations. Research must certainly move ahead, but that must not occur at just any price. We have to take a clear, uncompromising stand against any funding of research involving manipulation of genetic or embryonic material, which not only goes against ethical values and respect for human life and dignity, but is also a threat to public health.

Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, so-called ‘functional’ foods, those fortified substances that are supposed to improve the health or well-being of consumers, constitute one of the most innovative sectors, with the most room for market growth. We must therefore ensure that checks are carried out on this type of food and, above all, on the claims made on labels, which entice the consumer by promising benefits in terms of diet and health. The compromise text guarantees clear and comprehensive information in relation to food labels and enables consumers to make an informed choice about their diet. This measure is made all the more urgent if one considers the impact of advertising on children. Advertising, in actual fact, directly influences children’s food preferences and changes their consumption patterns. Furthermore, thanks to the measures taken by Parliament, due attention has been paid to SMEs, which must be supported if they are to adapt to the changes introduced by the regulation and which will consequently be able to rely both on definite time periods in which to place their own products on the market and on the possibility of using pre-authorised claims. Finally, I should like to thank the rapporteur, Mrs Poli Bortone, for the excellent, though not easy, job she has done.

 Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, I am sorry to say this, but the European Parliament is running the risk of creating a monster with this directive. Unfortunately, the objective of bringing down those hateful bureaucratic barriers that effectively strangle the free movement of services has substantially failed. What remains of the directive is a pastiche, the outcome of the rationale that compromise should be taken to the extreme, lumping together views that cannot coexist, namely unbridled liberalisation and protection for the corporate privileges of certain categories and sectors. It is in fact important to realise that all the powerful sectors have been excluded from the scope of this directive – telecommunications, banking and financial services, insurance and legal services – in other words, all those sectors that have been strong enough to keep out of the directive, whereas it will apply to all the weak sectors that need greater social protection and are less able to be represented and to exert pressure. Even so, I want to see the cup as being half full. I note that the country-of-origin principle has rightly been removed, and we hope that all services of general interest will be excluded from the scope of the directive. I should like to highlight two contributions that we have made to the text. First, the Commission is obliged to submit a report to the European Parliament on the implementation status of the directive, in order to check that it is being implemented properly and to ensure that the directive does not breach laws protecting workers’ and consumers’ rights. Secondly, we have called for a national monitoring body to be set up in each Member State to draw up an annual report and check that the directive is being implemented, so that it does not violate workers’ rights or result in practices that cause social dumping. The body must also check that workers are afforded all due health and safety protection in the workplace. In conclusion, I call for the body to monitor … (The President cut off the speaker)

 The Alleanza Nazionale
 delegation to the European Parliament abstained on the Brok report because it considers the following points to be indispensable prerequisites for Croatia’s accession to the European Union: 1.	To call for the suspension of EU accession negotiations for so long as the Croatian authorities maintain their ban preventing Community citizens of Italian nationality from having access to the property market, in clear contradiction of the principles of the acquis communautaire
; 2.	To call for full compensation for the property confiscated from the thousands of citizens of Italian origin expelled from Croatian territory since 1946, as a condition for Croatia’s accession; 3.	To call on the Croatian authorities to accept their responsibility, now historically proven and documented, for the deportations, atrocities, massacres and ethnic cleansing perpetrated against thousands of people of Italian origin by the Communist regime since 1946.

 Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, we were expecting much more from the Hong Kong meeting, even though it had already been announced that it was going to be a talking shop. Beyond the good intentions on the need to ensure a multilateral trading system, too many issues remained unresolved. Among the many issues that deeply affect thousands of European companies and workers is the problem of the unfair competition waged by certain non-EU countries to Europe’s detriment. Such unfair competition, as in the case of China, consists of social and environmental dumping. In plain words, that means European markets are being flooded with very low-cost goods, which in fact cost a great deal in terms of human rights violations, worker exploitation and a lack of environmental protection. These are shoddily made goods, which literally plunder the intellectual property and technological skills of European companies with impunity. Bringing down trade barriers is a good thing – nobody denies that – but it must not become merely an opportunity to place counterfeit goods or goods made with slave labour or child labour onto our markets. In conclusion, Mr President, it is our duty to ensure that the WTO regulations include strict rules on safeguarding intellectual property and on protecting quality products by means of geographical indications of origin, and also clauses demanding protection for the environment and for workers’ rights.

 Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, in the end Tony Blair has decided to don the robes of the Sheriff of Nottingham, with his drastic cuts to the budget and hard-line defence of the privilege of the UK rebate. Unless there are last-minute changes, London’s proposal is liable to set the seal on a resounding failure. In actual fact, we are facing a much deeper crisis: Mr Blair has simply chosen to exacerbate the clash, to show up Europe’s weakness and to bring its contradictions to the boil; he has simply highlighted the problems of a Europe torn apart by self interest, unwilling to make any effort to support enlargement, and unable to genuinely face up to the challenges of the third millennium or to assert itself as a unitary political entity on the world stage. Italy, as a founding member of the European Union, has always played its part and has always been willing to make sacrifices for the sake of the future. As a net contributor, it has paid 25% of the UK rebate for 20 years. Now, however, we have reached a crossroads: we cannot pay for the costs of enlargement all by ourselves. This time we cannot be the only ones to step back.

Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, the Commission needs to show its courage in Hong Kong, starting with the Chinese emergency. China has flooded the European market with seemingly low-cost products which in fact come with a very high price tag. Products from China – from clothing to processed foods, right through to technological equipment – are being made without any respect for human rights, for ridiculously low wages, without any consideration for the environment or guarantees of consumer safety and often through the use of child labour. What is more, all too often these goods are counterfeit, and so give rise to a huge market financing criminal organisations, in addition to directly damaging European companies and undermining their long tradition of professionalism. Our businesses do not seek privileges or the enjoyment of special positions: all they ask is to be able to compete in the international market on an equal footing, with joint respect for the rules. Unfair competition from China is killing our businesses and putting millions of jobs at risk. This is why we ask the European Commission to show its courage by intervening to protect manufacturing and jobs in Europe. In view of the World Trade Organisation Ministerial Conference in Hong Kong, we ask the Commission to insist that social and environmental clauses be introduced to prevent unfair competition from China, especially clauses which prevent social and environmental dumping, protect workers and the environment and actually place the safeguarding of rights above the movement of goods. Agreements should not be reached with people who exploit others, damage the environment and fail to provide guarantees on respect for human rights. Europe has to try to promote a social dimension within globalisation, whilst simultaneously fighting to protect European businesses.

 Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, to paraphrase your introductory words, Mr Straw, I am here and I beg to differ. Joking aside, despite Mr Blair’s and Mr Barroso’s welcome good intentions, the practical outcome of the Hampton Court Summit was highly unsatisfactory. First of all, the long-awaited platform on the Commission’s European social model seemed rather disappointing. No real strategy and no targets for a genuine revival of Europe’s economy were proposed; instead there was just a policy of damage limitation. So far there has been nothing concrete behind high-sounding claims such as the ‘Lisbonisation’ of resources and the globalisation fund. As for Mr Blair, the balance of his political account is certainly not in the black. Despite continual outward reassurances, there is in fact no agreement on the financial perspective, which is clearly the crux of the problem. Finally, there is no real intention above all to renew the debate on the United Kingdom’s unfair rebate. It is a privilege that has been paid for mainly by Italy and France, siphoning off precious resources from our two countries.

 Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, just as he did in June, President-in-Office Blair has again today given a speech full of good pro-European proposals. Today we have heard clear statements on strategic sectors for reviving the European economy, including energy, research and infrastructure. However, they are just words, because everything depends on agreement on the financial perspectives. In that respect – despite the reassuring statements – we are not convinced that there is the determination needed to bring the talks to a conclusion. In addition, too little was said about the new European social model, particularly on the eve of a Summit that is supposed to be dealing precisely with that. Above all, we are not convinced by Tony Blair’s enthusiasm for reviewing the working time directive, which runs the risk of becoming a tool for contractual blackmail against a growing mass of atypical, temporary workers. Nor are we convinced by his enthusiasm for the so-called Bolkestein directive, which in its current form just threatens the rights of workers and consumers while creating a mere 600 000 jobs in the best-case scenario: an elephant giving birth to a mouse!

 Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, in December we asked Turkey to give us a clear sign to show that it accepted the European Union’s rules on democracy by first of all recognising Cyprus. The Turkish Government’s refusal is, on the contrary, a sign of surprising intransigence. We are aware that it was a unilateral statement without legal effect, but for that very reason it was serious and unjustified. No less surprising is Europe’s attitude: with its eternal compromises it has once again shown its ambiguous role of putting off and exacerbating problems instead of solving them. We wish to emphasise that the outcome of Turkey’s accession procedure must not be a foregone conclusion. Turkey has to make tangible commitments, and we cannot make allowances on that account. I do not mean to say that there have been no improvements, but there is still too much to do on torture, respect for human and civil rights, and the protection of minorities. Above all, Turkey must not refuse to recognise an existing European Union Member State like Cyprus, let alone continue to occupy Cypriot soil with some 40 000 Turkish troops. What is needed is a serious, transparent accession procedure in line with the values of integration and mutual respect. We are also aware of the extent to which the Italian Government has committed itself to the success of the negotiations but, for the reasons that I have given, the Alleanza Nazionale
 delegation will mark its criticism by abstaining. That does not mean closing the door on Turkey; we just want the rules to be obeyed, because they must always be the same for everyone.

 Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, the recent European Union-United States agreement is only a first step – and certainly an inadequate and insufficient one – towards the international recognition and safeguarding of protected traditional names. It was time to change course after the harmful effects of the infamous Regulation (EC) No 316/2004, which effectively authorised producers in non-EU countries to make improper use of protected traditional names, thus causing enormous damage to quality wine production, both in Italy and, of course, in Europe as a whole. Commissioner Fischer Boel also stated in this Chamber that the agreement protects European names and will safeguard the European Union’s largest export market. There is no doubt that those are the aims to be achieved; doubt remains, however, as to whether the agreement is the right basis on which to achieve such aims. It is indeed true that the US Administration will put a bill before Congress to change the status and limit the use of 17 European names currently considered semi-generic in the United States, but it is also true that the United States will still be able to use 14 Community traditional names, although subject to certain conditions and for a limited period of time. In fact, the hoary question of the ongoing misuse of names has still not been settled once and for all. On the other hand, the United States has undertaken to accept the basic principles of the Community’s labelling rules and will seek to resolve any bilateral issues relating to the wine trade through informal bilateral consultations rather than through dispute settlement mechanisms. What is the most worrying concession made by the European Union? Well, under the agreement, the European Union recognises the wine-making practices of US wine producers. Substantially, what that means is that the EU can import wine diluted with 7% of added water or flavoured with wood chips, practices that our producers, of course, are absolutely forbidden to use. That will result in a serious threat to wines of excellence and a major upset in the wine market. Although we have succeeded in providing a certain stability for wine exports to the United States, not least through the easing of procedures, we have at all events gone too far on wine-making practices and we do not yet have sufficient guarantees regarding the misuse of protected names. Mr President, the agreement includes the commitment that negotiations for an even more thorough agreement will start 90 days after it enters into force. In this regard, we ask that the talks focus on the effective protection of traditional names. We believe that, during the talks, the Commission should above all try to obtain a final commitment from the US authorities to put an end to the illicit use in the United States of geographical indications protected by Community legislation within two years at most. I shall conclude by pointing out that the agreement and the extraordinary derogation for US imports could be used by other WTO member states to claim similar treatment, thus opening the floodgates to imports of dubious origin and composition. Faced with this situation, the European Union must take action with more vigorous measures in order to defend its production of traditional quality wines. We should make a fresh start by actually repealing Regulation (EC) No 316/2004, which liberalised the use of protected traditional names, thus creating unfair competition and misleading consumers as to the origin and quality of products.

It needs to be stressed that the textile sector is the tip of the iceberg: the invasion of the European market by Chinese products affects all sectors, from footwear to food. We need appropriate counter-measures. I am talking about the introduction of a compulsory non-EU origin label, to be applied to raw materials too. I am also referring to the combating of counterfeited products, which damage high-quality production as well as technical and craft-based knowledge assets in the sector. It would also be a good idea to conduct awareness campaigns in favour of ‘conscious consumption’ to help European consumers to choose products via legible and clear labelling. Finally, we should not forget that behind every Chinese product sold at a low price there are thousands of jobs lost in Europe, and in China human rights that have been denied, the death penalty, repression and child exploitation. To conclude, will the Lisbon Strategy arrive in time to finance research and innovation? So, are we sure that we can put aside the idea, as is happening in the United States, of imposing duties to protect our production and workers when outright commercial aggression is taking place, as in the case of the abnormal increases in Chinese exports?

Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, this proposal for a recommendation undoubtedly represents an advance for the protection of minors and human dignity, particularly in terms of safer Internet browsing for children and also guaranteeing a right of reply in relation to inaccurate information disseminated through any type of medium. It is a pity, though, that the legal basis chosen for this recommendation should be Article 157 of the Treaty, which is intended to ensure the competitiveness of European industry, instead of the more appropriate Article 153 on the protection of consumer interests. It is also a pity that the legal form chosen should have been a recommendation that, as is well known, has no legally binding force. In spite of this, it is very important that this report focuses on strengthening the protection of minors, through education programmes on information media designed to also enable adults, parents, teachers and trainers to teach minors to make proper use of the information media, especially the Internet. Also extremely important is the commitment to fight the danger of child pornography, especially on the Internet, which is to be combated through informative and preventative advertising campaigns. As the rapporteur also stated, the Internet is a formidable tool for communication with the entire world, but it should be safe and trustworthy. For this reason it is important for the Commission to agree to set up a European toll-free number to supply information on existing filtering systems that can also simplify the submission of complaints to the relevant authorities and the reporting of dangerous sites. In addition, it could be a good idea to promote the adoption of a seal of quality for providers, so that users can identify whether or not a particular provider is regulated by a code of conduct. Finally, another important point is the possibility of creating filters that will prevent at source the computer transmission of child pornography and other material that constitutes an assault on human dignity. To conclude, I would like to thank the rapporteur and all the Members who have worked together to draft this text.

Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, innovation and research have to be a shared heritage and not a privilege for the few. It must therefore be forcefully stated that the patentability of software as such must be prevented. It is important to point out this principle, in order to obtain a directive that represents a legitimate middle way between uncontrolled patenting, which risks paralysing innovation and competition, and the need to adequately safeguard those who, by means of their own inventions, can genuinely present added value in the market. We call, furthermore, for patent applications to be assessed with the greatest of attention, account being taken of innovation, originality and industrial applicability. This is the only way to prevent an excessive extension of patent rights prejudicing small and medium-sized enterprises, and, consequently, the proliferation of patent disputes, as has been happening for 15 years now in the United States. To conclude, we believe that it is a positive idea to create a fund offering financial, technical and administrative support to SMEs moving towards patenting. In particular, we believe that it is crucial to draw up an appropriate European patent regime, aimed at guaranteeing equal access for small and medium-sized enterprises.

Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, in mid-June the offensive of the so-called ‘G4’ will be launched, which intends to put forward a proposal for a resolution to the General Assembly that will increase the number of permanent members to 11, thus leaving the other 180 members of the UN to compete for the non-permanent seats. Approval of that proposal will increase the disparity among the Member States of the UN and will pose the problem of extending the right of veto, with the attendant risk of paralysing the Security Council. At European level, Germany’s entry into the Council would conversely mean abandoning once and for all a project of a Europe endowed with a serious and effective foreign policy. Italy, which has always been committed to the European Union having one single seat, is now leading the UFC group, which is opposed to the G4 proposal, hoping for the Council to be restructured on a regional basis. It is only by means of this type of reform that the European Union would obtain the role that belongs to it at international level. National egoisms need to be put to one side if we are to offer the European Union a credible political future.

Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, as a convinced pro-European, but equally as an Italian Member who is also here to represent and defend the interests of her nation, I find the Juncker proposal, setting the paltry sum of 1.05% of GDP for the contributions of the Member States to the European budget, to be unacceptable. In the case of Italy alone, which is a net contributor to the European Union, that means an annual cut of around EUR 8 billion, reducing the funds allocated to employment and justice to the bare bones, and cancelling almost half of the funds for research, innovation and trans-European networks, not to mention the Lisbon Strategy. There are too many cuts and too many contradictions. The so-called UK rebate also needs to be reviewed. In actual fact, this exception, the privilege that sees Great Britain obtain a rebate of a substantial proportion of the contributions it makes, must be scrapped. It is a provision sought by Mrs Thatcher – in 1984, if I am not mistaken – that was unfortunately, and inexplicably, reconfirmed during Mr Prodi’s presidency: a rebate that is mostly paid for by France and by Italy. To conclude, the Juncker proposal is the umpteenth demonstration of the profound distance that exists between European bureaucracy and the real needs of the European people.

Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, faced with the invasion of Chinese textile goods, the urgent adoption – and I stress urgent – of the safeguard mechanism is a crucial step. There is a need, however, also to responsibly think up a strategy for the long-term. There are six points to which I should briefly like to draw the attention of the Community institutions. Firstly: a strong commitment to the fight against the counterfeiting of European goods and trademarks, together with a more incisive and effective strategy on intellectual property is vital. Secondly: an unambiguous policy for strengthening, at European level, customs controls on goods originating from outside of Europe. Thirdly: the introduction of a non-EU mark of origin, which will also apply to products that are only partially manufactured in third countries. Fourthly: putting on the agenda a serious discussion of the consequences of the excessive appreciation of the euro. Fifthly: a European pledge to finally hold a debate on the systematic and unjustifiable devaluation of the Chinese currency (the yuan), in the framework of the WTO. The sixth and final point: calling on China to comply with international rules protecting workers and human rights.

 Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, the forthcoming European Council is going to deal with crucial reforms for the future of the European Union, including reform of the Stability Pact. This reform is unfortunately enveloped in mystery. In fact, we go from general news about a possible nineteen points to make the Pact more flexible to the possibility of leaving the Pact unchanged. In that respect, all that remains is regret at the opportunity that Parliament has wasted through being unwilling for this Chamber to directly enter the debate on how to reform the Pact. The President of Parliament and also the main political groups are to blame for that. It seems that we are reaching a possible compromise, as usual, characterised by tactical manoeuvring and political balancing acts. That is not what Europe needs right now. Instead, it needs bolder and more pragmatic approaches to the key objectives for revitalising the economy, that is to say investment in research, innovation, competitiveness, infrastructure and structural reform. That is also why I stress that I am baffled at the refusal by the Commission and the Luxembourg Presidency to consider applying the so-called golden rule, which could have done a great deal to boost our economic growth. We owe it above all to the younger generation to make a practical commitment to the future of our economy. In that respect, we need a genuine Pact for young people. The young need to be able to look forward to a future of stability, security and social cohesion, thanks to measures helping them to enter the workforce and to have access to credit, as well as measures directed towards the right to a home and a family. To conclude, I believe that the European Union needs to make a strong commitment to guarantee effective opportunities for Europe’s younger generations. That is what we are calling for, and that is what young people above all are expecting.

 Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, we should like to make it clear yet again that the Acciai Speciali Terni affair must not be seen merely as a local affair and much less a national one, because it affects all European steelmaking, a vital sector of EU industry. Italy is doing what it can at all levels to resolve the ThyssenKrupp case. It is now time for Germany to send out some positive signals as well, and for the European Union to accept its own responsibilities. We all know that the Terni affair is not the first or the only case. There is a long list of companies that have made considerable profits in part through the sacrifice, commitment and professionalism of their workers, and have then chosen to relocate, often to non-EU countries, unscrupulously dumping the resulting job and social crisis on the Member States. As a number of Members have already stated, while ThyssenKrupp has on the one hand reassured us with a letter, on the other it has today announced its so-called ‘release’ of 630 workers this morning. How can that not be seen as an arrogant way to behave? It shows that ThyssenKrupp has no intention of taking any notice of what Parliament is preparing to vote on tomorrow. That is why it is our duty, especially to the workers and their families, to propose practical measures today, and so we ask the Commission for some specific commitments. First, we need legislation on corporate social responsibility, combining competitiveness with respect for the rights of workers and regions. Above all, however, we call on the Commission to stop dodging the main challenge facing Europe’s economy, on which the future of the European economic system depends: in other words, the ‘relocation’ crisis. The European Union is virtually still in the dark ages on this issue, whereas instead it is essential to intervene with a strategy to limit and regulate relocations both within and outside the EU, to guarantee, among other things, growth and employment, competitiveness and innovation: in short, to achieve the principal objectives of the Lisbon Agenda. This Parliament, which has the specific duty to represent the rights and expectations of European citizens, must have the courage to send the Commission a strong, unified document that does not ignore the crucial question of relocation, which is putting the future of Europe’s economy at stake. We therefore call on you to vote for our amendment.

 Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, the need for reform of the Stability Pact is also clear from the report on public finances in EMU. The Pact undoubtedly has an important role in terms of stability, but also needs to act as a stimulus to growth. We are aware that Ministers at the Ecofin Council meeting are preparing the text for the reform, but Parliament must not opt out of the debate. It would therefore be desirable, prior to the final decision by the Council, for Parliament to have an opportunity to express its views on the procedures for reform of the Pact by holding a debate on the subject. Since the debate in September, Parliament appears to have adopted a passive stance, whereas it should instead be exercising a key role in the reform process, above all allowing all Members and groups to give a clear outline of the possible strategies. We have to be practical and realistic. We cannot state in our documents that we have to become the most competitive economy in the world, while at the same time the figures are clearly showing growth to be stagnating. The Pact therefore has to be reformed. I refer to more flexible ways of applying the Pact during periods of economic difficulty, to the need to give due credit for the structural reforms undertaken by Member States, and, possibly, to allow expenditure on investments in support of the – still remote – objectives of the Lisbon strategy to be excluded. To conclude, I believe Parliament must resume an active role in this debate, as the only institution directly representing the citizens of the Union.

 Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, looking beyond individual national problems, the Commission statement reveals a picture of overall difficulty for the European economic system. No state can reverse this downturn alone; it is the duty of the European institutions, in particular the Commission, to fire up the European economy by concentrating on a strategy aimed at employment, growth and inclusive development. Firstly, the Lisbon strategy needs to be relaunched, in a such a way that it finally becomes effective, and a national administrator should be appointed to meet its objectives. Secondly, the Stability Pact needs to be revised intelligently, so as to encourage structural reforms and to facilitate pursuit of the Lisbon objectives, boosting investment in infrastructure and research to increase competitiveness. In this regard, I consider it essential to hold a debate in the European Parliament on the reform of the Stability Pact before the European Council in March. Lastly, perhaps we need to return to the idea, originally put forward by Mr Delors, of financing European public investment to support growth and competitiveness by issuing Community bonds, which, now, would be guaranteed by the current strength of the euro.

 Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, as observers of the elections in Palestine we can say that, to all intents and purposes, a proud young democracy is being born there. During our mission we saw that the people of Palestine have a strong desire for freedom and are looking forward to a return to normality and peace. Despite the violence of recent weeks, the presidential elections have indeed ushered in a new scenario in the Middle East and have set an example to the whole Arab world. For that very reason, the European Union must now take a central role and do all it can to support the peace process, first of all by relaunching the roadmap, which is still the starting point for resuming negotiations. In that respect, this morning’s news that talks between the Palestinian National Authority and Israel are reopening augurs well. The first major event in the new peace process will be the London Conference, to be held in March; security, the consolidation of democracy, and political, institutional and economic reforms in Palestine will be on the agenda. Europe will at last have an opportunity to exercise its authority in the peace process and also, I believe, to put forward an economic programme to foster development. We are surprised to hear it said sometimes that action of that kind would be premature and that the European Union would not be prepared to support it. On the contrary, this is precisely the time for the Union to take the political centre stage with concrete action to support the development of the Palestinian economy, by means of an EU-monitored programme characterised as a new Marshall Plan for Palestine, as was proposed by Italy the day after 11 September and recently put forward again by the United Kingdom. I also believe that that is the way for Palestine to escape from the poverty and marginalisation that all too often swell the ranks of fundamentalism.

 Mr President, the Luxembourg Presidency’s programme is packed with crucial issues for the future of Europe, including the priorities on the economic front: the Lisbon strategy, reform of the Stability Pact and approval of the financial perspective up to 2013. My first point is that it will soon be time for the mid-term review of the level of implementation of the Lisbon strategy. To give it a greater chance of success, the programme needs to make the individual Member States responsible for achieving the targets that were set. To that end, I consider the proposal to specify an individual at national level to be responsible for putting the strategy into practice to be a very useful idea. Secondly, with regard to the review of the Stability Pact, it has also been emphasised this morning that a reform is needed which can propose a more flexible interpretation of the Pact during times of recession, without bypassing the Maastricht criteria and without giving up the commitment to reduce the debt. I am also convinced that steps could be taken to exclude certain specific types of investment from the calculation of the deficit in order to give a new boost to Europe’s growth and competitiveness. Thirdly, I hope that we can really succeed in approving the financial perspective up to 2013 by June, so that the resources can be used to the full from the very beginning of the period in question. I especially hope that the proposals – the Council’s and the Commission’s proposals on those important topics – are adequately discussed in advance by Parliament which, let us recall, is the only European institution that directly represents the sovereignty of the people. Lastly, I hope that a European civil protection agency will at last be set up during the Luxembourg Presidency so that natural disasters can be dealt with in an appropriate manner, with particular emphasis on prevention.

Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I am convinced that one of the new Commission’s priorities ought to be to begin a constructive debate on the Stability Pact and possible reforms to it. Let us quickly clear away any misunderstandings. No one is intending – and the Commissioner responsible has done well in confirming this emphatically – to think up a reform to get around the Maastricht criteria. Rigour in complying with the Treaty and a commitment to a progressive reduction of deficits remain the objectives needed to make Europe economically credible and stable. I believe, however, that it is possible to have a debate on the operational criteria for achieving the objective of deficit reduction, and to think not so much in terms of a reform as of a transformation of the Pact, one that can reconcile budget rigour and flexibility in order to give renewed impetus to growth, development, employment and, finally, the Lisbon strategy. The Italian Government has done its thinking, and has not gone unheard. Faced with considerable concerns over the excessively high rate of the euro and the loss of Europe’s competitiveness compared with the United States and emerging countries, the proposal could be to remove investments in infrastructure and research from the calculation of national budgets. In simple terms, this means introducing the golden rule to achieve the goal of budgetary consolidation without compromising the recovery. In conclusion, the Pact can no longer content itself with being merely a pact for stability, and unfortunately also a pact for economic stagnation, but must become a pact for competitiveness, for structural reform and, above all, a pact to guarantee a future for our children.

 Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, is it a good idea to start negotiations with Turkey? The answer to that question is neither simple nor a foregone conclusion. On the one hand there is Turkey’s legitimate aspiration to join the European Union. In fact, we certainly cannot ignore or underestimate either the efforts Turkey has made to achieve concrete legislative and institutional convergence with European criteria or its political perseverance and steadfast conviction that it will come to play an active part in the enlargement of Europe. As Europeans, however, we have a duty not to make concessions, because democracy cannot afford them, just as it cannot afford to sell values, human rights or civil freedoms cheaply. There is still a great deal to do in these areas in Turkey, especially as regards respect for women and children, the protection of minorities and the abolition of torture and capital punishment. In the end there are two problems to solve, two conditions that Turkey cannot avoid: it must restore normal relations both with Armenia, by reopening its border, and with Cyprus. In the latter case, the withdrawal of its troops is a precondition for accession, as is its recognition of the Cypriot state. Indeed, it is unacceptable that, at the same time as it is applying to join the European Union, not only does Turkey not recognise a Member State like Cyprus but it even keeps thousands of troops on Cypriot soil. Thus Turkey will still have to face a long process, which necessarily excludes accession a priori
. Realistically, however, we cannot close the door on a Muslim country with secular institutions that is seeking to take a European path of modernisation and development. Narrowing the gap with Turkey in fact means sending out an important message to the moderate Muslim world, one that can overcome the extremes of fundamentalism and can initiate a dialogue or a meeting of religions and cultures.

Mr President, we have many hopes of this new Commission, for which we shall cast our vote in favour tomorrow. Briefly, we expect the creation of a Europe that can at last take on an effective and realistic role. There are many aims that cannot be postponed further: in the first place, we need the much discussed revision of the Stability Pact, so that it becomes a pact for growth and development also. On that subject, we shall insist on the inclusion of the so-called ‘golden rule’ – the rule that allows spending on research and investment to be removed from the computation of public debt. Another fundamental subject is the fight against illegal immigration and terrorism. This cannot be reduced to repression alone, but must be directed towards the implementation of a plan for economic aid to the poorest countries of the Middle East and to developing countries, thereby acting on the most basic causes of the problem, which can be identified first and foremost as lying in poverty and social exclusion. Finally, the common foreign and security policy. After the implementation of monetary union, we need finally to take realistic steps to ensure that Europe plays a leading role on the international stage. It is therefore fundamentally important to open a debate on reform of the United Nations Security Council, such that the European Union can afterwards lay claim to a decisive role. What matters is that this Europe does not stay looking on, in its torpor and its rhetoric, but instead makes itself active and efficacious in practice on the international scene. In conclusion, I should like to remind Mr Schulz that the European Commission has the precise and democratic duty to deal with the whole of Parliament and must not reach an accommodation – as he maintained – with one political group alone. His observations amount to – and excuse me for using a term that may be a little too vehement – vague blackmail, and are unworthy of a major group such as that which he represents. Finally, allow me a closing line: we hope that the same degree of fervour employed by one part of this Parliament in the anti-Buttiglione, and also somewhat anti-Italian, crusade will be directed in future to the better cause of a Europe that is a practical and effective exponent of the aspirations of European citizens.

 Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, it is incredible that this morning’s debate has not focused on the new Commission’s commitments and the current emergencies, which arouse such strong feelings among the citizens whom we represent. We have not talked about immigration policies, the fight against terrorism, the reform of the Structural Funds or the reform of the Stability Pact. The stage of our little European theatre has been taken over by a thoroughly ideological and calculated attack on the Commission-designate and in particular on the Commissioner-designate Mr Buttiglione, who is guilty of having personal opinions and religious beliefs. The apologies which the Commissioner-designate did in fact offer were not enough; even the changes which the President-designate did in fact make were not enough: people want to settle a score at all costs. That is unacceptable. Voting down the Commission tomorrow – let us not pretend otherwise – would lead to an institutional crisis that we really do not need right now. Just two days away from the signing of the Constitutional Treaty in Rome, which ought to be a solemn, historic moment, we really cannot allow ourselves a pathetic act of weakness that would be totally out of keeping with the expectations of Europe’s citizens and of the world as a whole. What would be quite clear to them yet again would be the total lack of any political or institutional substance in the Community institutions. (Applause)

 Mr President, the fact that the recent Olympic Games in Athens saw two gold medals taken away on the grounds of drug use as well as the disqualification of several athletes demonstrates the persistence of an abuse that involves amateur athletes and great professionals alike. This ever-increasing phenomenon is in fact not being fought with the severity it deserves and this is also probably why more and more athletes start using drugs, in some cases in the foolish belief that they are practically harmless or at least not very dangerous. Drug use is also assuming really worrying dimensions as an economic phenomenon: it is in fact behind an enormous volume of business which evidently benefits large criminal organisations among others. Our question to the Commission is whether Community support measures in the battle against drug use in sport, which financed 32 pilot projects from 2000 to 2002, can truly show a positive result in terms of effective action, or whether instead the entire Community programme should be entirely rethought. Let us bear in mind first that it is actually today that the tenth conference of Sports Ministers is meeting within the ambit of the Council of Europe, with the aim of encouraging honesty and transparency in sport, and second the great educational values associated with the development of sporting activities, as evidenced in this very year of 2004, which has been the Year of Education Through Sport. We therefore ask the Commission whether it should not actually commit itself more thoroughly to the battle against drug use and whether, after having financed research projects on the phenomenon, it should not now go on to finance information and persuasion campaigns, prevention campaigns in brief, which would be truly more incisive.

 The Italian delegation of the Union for a Europe of the Nations Group has voted against Amendment No 4 on voting rights for immigrants to the Bourlanges report on the future of the area of freedom, security and justice because, while it is possible to consider the idea of granting immigrants the right to vote in local elections, the times are not yet ripe for contemplating the right to vote in European elections. We must point out, moreover, that recognition of the right to vote in local elections must provide for a detailed regulatory framework through an appropriate proposal that would clearly specify the procedures, times and the specific legal context.

 Mr President, I believe it is only right and proper that this Parliament should formally express its shock and outrage at the number of victims of the terrorist attack in Taba last week. I believe we should send a message of solidarity and profound condolence to the families of the victims, amongst whom I should like to remember especially the two young Italian women, Jessica and Sabrina, whose only crime was to allow themselves a holiday that they had been really looking forward to after a year’s work.

Mr President, Mr President of the Commission, as is right at a time of stocktaking, as well as being pleased with the progress made it is also worth highlighting those goals which have not been achieved, or have not been properly achieved, provided this is done in a way that will be constructive as far as the future is concerned. First: the introduction of the euro has of course been an important achievement. The Commission, however, could have done more to support the Member States in combating the resulting rise in prices and in helping businesses forced to square accounts with a euro that was too strong. Secondly: the problems relating to enlargement are very far from solved. The new countries complain of still being thought of as second-class, while the old ones will have to deal with a situation where there is less funding available and a workforce in the enlargement countries that is much cheaper than their own. Finally, we must lament the fact that the reform of the Stability Pact, which has been considered an urgent matter since 2001, is still incomplete, particularly after the crisis following 11 September. As other Members have done, I would also like to remind you that in this Chamber, or rather in the Chamber of Strasbourg, it was Mr Prodi himself who correctly described the pact as stupid. From the future Commission, we expect concrete and rapid answers to these problems, and we expect it to speed up Euro-bureaucracy as much as possible. To conclude, it has truly saddened us, Mr Prodi, perhaps because in 1999 we too gave you our trust, to have seen you all too often playing a leading party role in Italian national politics. I believe that on this point the only assessment that can be given is a negative one.

 Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, while we acknowledge its good intentions, we regret that Europe is essentially inadequate when confronted with the tragic events of the international crisis, the rise of terrorism and the situation in Iraq. Commissioner, if there is too much of the United States in international relations, it is because Europe is indeed impotent. We as Europeans would like to already have the Constitution, which we have taken so long to approve, because we would like to already have a European Foreign Minister who could be out in Iraq right now to perform his office with genuine authority and also to negotiate the release of the French and Italian hostages. I should like here to remember the two young Italian women, Simona Pari and Simona Torretta. Such terrorism, for which a human life counts for nothing, which kills and rapes innocent children, which kidnaps peace workers or civilians and holds the governments and peoples of Europe to ransom, can only receive our most severe and unconditional condemnation. Through its work of destabilisation, such terrorism is probably also aiming at somehow delaying or preventing the holding of elections in Iraq, an outcome that would be thoroughly unacceptable. In conclusion, to all those who are in Iraq, to the soldiers on peace-keeping missions, to the NGOs, which with admirable perseverance have chosen to stay and carry on their work of aiding the civilian population, to the victims’ families and, at this moment, if I may, especially to the families of the hostages – to all of them I believe the whole Chamber here in Strasbourg should raise its voice loud and clear in solidarity and fellow feeling.

 Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, although it is not the subject of the debate, I take the opportunity to express my feeling of regret at the fact that it was not thought desirable to insert a reference to Europe’s Christian roots in the preamble to the Constitution. Having said that, I can only agree with the requirement to give the people as much information about the draft Constitution as possible and to establish a coordinated timetable for ratification of the Constitution itself, in the hope that all European citizens can have the right and the opportunity to take part in this stage of the constitutional process through popular referendums in all the Member States. We should not be afraid of participation and democracy, because it is the only way in which the new Europe of peoples, of rights and of the Constitution will really be a strong and empowered Europe.

 Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I would like to return to the points with which the sitting opened. The Italian delegation of the Union for the Europe of Nations Group suggests that the Members of this Parliament make a one-off contribution corresponding to a day’s allowance as a donation to the International Red Cross, symbolically set aside for reconstruction of the school in Beslan. I also think it right that this Parliament, sitting in plenary session, in addition to the resolute condemnation of all terrorist acts and the words spoken at the start of the sitting, send a message of solidarity and fellow-feeling to the families of the civilian hostages held in Iraq, in particular the two French journalists and the two young Italian women, Simona Pari and Simona Torretta, in the hope that all those taken hostage can return home safe and sound.

 Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, as a result of the limited time available yesterday, I could not, as I wanted, thank all those who have worked with me. This has been a difficult directive, and there have been very lengthy discussions, but in my view we have ultimately reached a successful conclusion. I should like in particular to thank all my colleagues on the Committee on Industry, Research and Energy for their cooperation, especially the shadow rapporteurs, Mr Reul, Mr Swoboda, Mr Manders, Mr Turmes, Mr Seppänen, and obviously Commissioner Piebalgs – I hope I have not left anyone out – as well as Mr Vidal-Quadras for his cooperation. I should also like to thank the secretariat as a whole, my staff and my fellow workers. Only three seconds. This is a directive which is of interest and is extremely important. It is a directive – please may I speak for three seconds. It is a directive – we lose so much time in this House! – which is of interest to operators, often, unfortunately, in the form of monopolies, and to consumers. I believe that in our work, we have tried not to penalise producers or consumers but have tried – and thank you for the applause, but I shall press on – we have tried to work for all European citizens in the sense … Right, you are in a hurry, let us conclude very briefly. This, and I thank you, is a very pleasing expression of parliamentary democracy in Europe. (Applause)

 Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, here we are at last on the home straight after many long months of work. It has certainly not been easy. Albeit with a few misgivings, I believe that the committee's proposals are equal to the arduous task of dismantling established monopolies. These, as well as preventing new competitors from accessing the market, have long restricted investment and the capacity for network interconnection. Anyone who heard my speeches in the committee knows that I have regarded ownership unbundling as a priority right from the outset, so as to ensure that companies transporting gas are fully independent of companies generating it, even though of course ownership unbundling is no miracle cure for all ills. It goes without saying that, once a vertically integrated company is allowed – even if only temporarily – to retain ownership of transport systems, there is a need to establish effective regulatory control mechanisms which are neither too onerous nor too invasive. Obviously, as we all know, the implementing measures for the gas directive will inevitably follow a different schedule from those for electricity. This difference emerged clearly in the Committee on Industry, which opted for the ITO – the Independent Transmission Operator – as an alternative to ownership unbundling. It is a compromise proposal, certainly not my own preferred option, but one that does go in the direction of greater liberalisation. Indeed, unlike the ISO, the ITO will be answerable to a separate body with genuine supervisory powers. I hope the Council will take up the ITO proposal as approved by the Committee on Industry. The fundamental role to be conferred on the Agency by the forthcoming legislative framework should be emphasised: it must not be a purely advisory role – as I fear might be the Council's intention – but one that envisages a broader remit for the Agency in future. If we are to attain the goal of reducing our energy dependence, we need a single energy market and a single integrated network. I therefore urge colleagues to support the amendments tabled by myself, and by other colleagues from various political groups, concerning the possibility of combining the various transport operators into one single European network company, in order to ensure that there is a single legislative framework and to guarantee market access for all operators, thereby overcoming the ‘unbundling yes; ownership unbundling no’ hurdle. Another very important aspect of my report is the central role of consumers. I shall be brief. There needs to be a transparent, comprehensible means of determining tariffs, enabling consumers to access consumption data at any time and giving them freedom to change supplier if they so wish. Regarding the comitology procedure, I am pleased that the Commission has accepted my position: I believe that it is up to Member States to lay down the guidelines, rather than a committee speaking for the Commission alone. Finally, I should like to mention the agreement reached between the political groups, and set out in my report, concerning the powers and role of national regulators: I think this is an important agreement, especially as regards the possibility of imposing sanctions. It is for us, ladies and gentlemen, to decide whether we want tomorrow to be remembered as a key moment in the creation of a single integrated energy market, which Europe needs in order to confront the challenges of the next millennium, or whether, on the other hand, it will mark the umpteenth climb-down, the result of a timid, cowardly reform effort which will basically be postponed until the next legislative term. I hope, moreover, that the Council will give due consideration to Parliament's decisions. That is not always the case.

 Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, I knew from the very outset that this would not be an easy or straightforward discussion. This directive is without doubt difficult to bring to fruition, but after today's debate – which has certainly been very intensive and high-calibre – I believe that I, and all of us, can now be somewhat more confident that a positive solution will be found. A large number of colleagues have spoken, and it would take at least one more working day to reply to each one. Our timetable does not allow for that. There has in addition been a good deal of – too much – praise and flattery expressed towards me: I trust it will not unduly go to my head. I think that the compliments paid to me ought rather to be addressed to the entire Committee on Industry, which has worked very conscientiously throughout these many long months. I should therefore like to express particular gratitude to my colleagues, Mr Manders, Mr Swoboda and Mr Reul, Commissioner Pibelgas of course and also Mr Vidal-Quadras. Thank you all. I think our work during this period has been absolutely transparent and cooperative, trying to consult everyone and involve everyone in the directive. I do believe that we have achieved clarity and transparency. On a few occasions I did perhaps ask certain colleagues to divest themselves of the mantle of national parliamentarian, in other words to cast off their partisan allegiances, so as to function a little more as Members of this House at the service of all EU citizens. I would just like to conclude by allaying the fears of Mr Zīle, who raised the problem of Gazprom and Russia. We are of course well aware that this is an extremely serious issue which has to be addressed, explored and resolved very carefully and above all very thoroughly. Regarding consumers, I believe that I have argued in every speech I have made over the months, and in my report too, for transparency and help for consumers, naturally without forgetting operators, who also have their merits. That is why we must not give in to major powers or European monopolies, and not just European ones.

 Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, today, by voting in favour of the Weber report, we may have taken a crucial step towards drawing up a comprehensive framework of measures against illegal immigration: measures that will respond to the security demands of a huge number of European citizens, many of them victims of crime perpetrated by third-country nationals. I am pleased to ascertain, to note, that the European Parliament, guarantor of universal freedom and rights, has at last come out in favour of a common policy to meet the needs of Member States in the fight against illegal immigration. We have made clear that the aim is not just to detect those who are staying illegally, but also to put in place clear, transparent and rapid return procedures. It is therefore not only a matter of clamping down on the phenomenon, as some would have it, for instance with the re-entry ban … (The President cut off the speaker)

These measures are geared to scrupulous respect for human rights in reception centres. Illegal immigration must be combated above all by seeking agreements with the countries of origin, which cannot stand by and watch the unfolding of a tragedy that is no longer just national but also European, and by sending out a strong signal to those preparing to enter Europe illegally. Our continent is not a land of conquest for anyone and everyone, and there are duties as well as rights to be respected.

Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, in spite of the fine proposals adopted by the Committee on Industry, Research and Energy, which warmly welcomed the position put forward in the Morgan report – and I would also like to congratulate the rapporteur for the excellent work she has done – I am sorry to say that recently positions have emerged that in my view are designed to change the fine achievements of the committee. I refer to the Council’s conclusions, which leave little space for a concrete change of approach to create a competitive and competition-based energy market. The Council is proposing the ITO model, which is in fact very similar to the third way. This position does not seem to me to be at all consistent with the work done by the committee, which has endorsed by a considerable majority full ownership unbundling and total opposition to the establishment of alternative systems, not to mention the marginal role of the agency. I wonder, therefore, what is the point of creating an agency if it is only supposed to play a purely advisory role? If we tried to overcome the current diversity of legislative frameworks, according to the Council we would exacerbate the situation and create even more distortion. I therefore hope that Parliament will exercise its vote with awareness and will stick to the line set out by Mrs Morgan.

 Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, I had planned to speak once, but I will speak again after Mr Fava has spoken, of course. Madam President, I am very sorry, but I believe, from what I have heard here today, that this debate was prompted by a persecutory, accusatory and punitive attack on a Member State and a government that was elected by an overwhelming majority. Unfortunately for some, however, it is guilty of not being a left-wing government. It is not our fault if the Roma are visible in Italy almost exclusively by virtue of their crimes of theft, robbery, child abduction and begging. This is the image that gypsies have in Italy, this is the image that the Roma have created, despite our best efforts. I am still looking for a Roma in Italy – and please someone tell me if they know of one – who is legally employed and who pays taxes. Do not accuse me of racism, please be serious. I am only defending honest Europeans – be quiet and go back to your gallery, go back to your gallery! – Madam President, I was interrupted. Do not accuse me of racism, be serious. I am only defending honest Europeans and honest Roma. Each Member State should put the safety of its citizens first, otherwise citizens will feel justified in dispensing their own justice. Therefore, to conclude, I would like the Spanish MPs and MEPs to get a grip, keep quiet and put their own houses in order a bit more.

Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, my opinion, also in the light of what I have heard during this debate, is still that the only path to follow is definitely that of discussion and dialogue, even if it is difficult to understand on what basis this dialogue can develop. How, indeed, is it possible to have a dialogue with a country that does not respect the rights of the child and extends the death penalty to minors? With a country, or rather it would be better and more correct to say with a regime, that has public hangings, a regime that threatens to want to wipe out the state of Israel? And, on the nuclear issue, should we just put it off and not even doubt that nuclear power is for peaceful use? How far should we believe the military plans for national defence? In addition, can we consider a regime that finances guerrilla warfare in neighbouring countries to be trustworthy? With regard then to the CIA report, I would suggest that we should not have too many illusions about its reliability. It would not be the first time for such a report later to be publicly repudiated. It is certainly the case that we cannot refuse anyone the possibility of experimenting with nuclear power for civilian, and not military, purposes, but not only does President Ahmadinejad not provide guarantees, he does not give a single guarantee, in fact he makes us fear the worst. In ruling out the option of military intervention - this I believe to be the view of all the representatives and Members of the European Parliament: avoiding military intervention is absolutely fundamental – I believe that the option of sanctions would be a disaster for everyone, it would penalise the economy and it would penalise a defenceless, uninformed and innocent people. I would suggest again that diplomacy should be used, because, and I repeat, nothing good has ever come out of sanctions, they serve only to increase hatred of the West and of the United States of America in particular.

Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I wanted to give an overview of the key points of this strategy and discuss the recommendations contained in my opinion. Guaranteeing equal social coverage of all workers regardless of the form of contract, speeding up bureaucratic procedures for small and medium-sized undertakings, and providing incentives, including financial incentives, for training are aspects of primary importance. To discuss only those aspects would, however, be less than generous towards those who rightly call for explanations and justice in face of dreadful tragedies such as the one that occurred a few days ago in Turin, to which Mr Panzeri referred a moment ago. During the night of 6/7 December, a fire that spread through the ThyssenKrupp factory killed seven workers; the fire extinguishers were not working. It was only later that it emerged that the factory did not comply with safety regulations! The European Parliament and I myself cannot fail to record that disgrace. I certainly do not intend totally to condemn the conduct of the German multinational or even imagine that the factory, however guilty, maliciously and deliberately failed to comply with the safety requirements in order to save money. I will not espouse the ideological arguments put forward by some Italian left-wing union members who, on learning last June of the closure of the factory, set themselves up as champions of safety and declared that they were responsible for and took care of safety at the factory. However, the moment has not yet come to make judgments, especially hasty ones. While respecting national competences in the matter, I do consider it urgently necessary for the European Union to guarantee that laws are implemented in full, first and foremost by reinforcing the inspection activities of the Agency for Health and Safety at Work, and to strengthen the coordination between the various national agencies by improving the functioning of the European Senior Labour Inspectors’ Committee.

 Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I am speaking partly in my capacity as future draftsman of the opinion on the Community strategy on health and safety at work. I wish to clarify my position, which is unhesitatingly in favour of the proposed regulation to establish a legal framework for the systematic production of statistics in this area. I would take this opportunity to emphasise the need to take all initiatives that can help provide a clearer picture of the situation in Europe and in the various Member States, on which basis states can pursue the policies they deem most appropriate. For this reason, a more Europe-wide approach needs to be adopted towards accidents at work within the European Union, a veritable scourge in certain countries. The approach must go beyond the current gentlemen’s agreement and provide for data to be gathered systematically at regular, predetermined intervals. It must also take due account of the studies and investigations carried out by the European Agency for Safety and Health at Work and by the European Foundation for the Improvement of Living and Working Conditions. Comparable data, combined with an exchange of good practice and the dissemination of results, can in themselves prove useful in encouraging countries to emulate the best of what is being done elsewhere.

 Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, I just feel a need to clarify a few points about the new generation of nuclear technology. It is worth remembering that Italy’s nuclear power stations were shut down following a rescinding referendum in 1987, perhaps rightly so, although that has gradually placed us in a situation of dependence on foreign sources of energy. However, the new generation of nuclear technology, which is clean and safe and environmentally friendly, is undoubtedly necessary to confront the problem of energy supply and climate change. The energy mix must hence be updated and, along with renewables, clean coal and gas, nuclear will enable Europe to limit its dependence in future. For this reason I voted in favour of the building of fourth-generation nuclear power stations, which will enable energy to be generated in a safer and more environmentally friendly manner. I do, however, still have doubts, serious doubts and concerns, about the storage of nuclear waste. The report may consider the problem of waste storage solved, but quite frankly I disagree: the waste problem is crucial and, if it is to be solved in the near future, requires a huge amount of investment in research. To conclude, I believe that the choice of energy mix – just three more seconds please – to ensure security of energy supply for the Union in coming years must be altered as research progresses and in particular as new technologies develop.

I supported the Thomsen report, which confirms the need to obtain 20% of energy from renewable energy sources by 2020. This will be a major challenge for every European country, and we must no longer seek to evade the challenge or require only the most virtuous and far-seeing Member States to meet it. I think differentiated national objectives need to be set, allocated fairly with regard to the existing levels of renewable energies, the energy mix and the differing development potentials that result from varied climate, geological and territorial conditions in the Member States. Renewable sources represent the future. Investment in innovation and technology will need to be huge in order to allow Europe to resolve the problem of energy dependency within a reasonable time-frame, guaranteeing affordable prices for users. I believe, however, that we ought to be pragmatic, and avoid succumbing to hypocrisy. Imagining that the production of renewable energy will by itself allow us to meet such ambitious targets is unrealistic, although the preconceptions and often ideological ideas of certain left-wing and Green politicians may convince us otherwise. What can save Europe in the medium term is an energy mix which also includes energy sources that are not wholly renewable, such as nuclear power, which, like it or not, accounts for one third of Europe’s electricity production.

 Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, the proposal for a regulation on roaming charges is a subject in which citizens take a keen interest, and therefore requires us to ensure the best possible protection without ignoring the needs of industry. We can however note with satisfaction that we have witnessed all the political groups taking responsibility for this, which will certainly not have been what European users were expecting. This is a regulation that will bring Europe still closer to its citizens. Following long negotiations, particularly with the Council and the Commission, to enable us to reach an agreement at first reading, the compromise solution formally reached only on Monday evening can please everyone, even if more could clearly be done. It would clearly have been possible to reach an agreement on figures closer to consumers’ expectations, as confirmed, moreover, by the Committee on Industry, Research and Energy, if only the Member States had not opted initially for much higher charges more favourable to operators. The compromise is valid, however, setting maximum charges for the retail market of 49 cents for outgoing calls and 24 cents for incoming calls; in other words representing a cut of around 50% compared to the standard charges. I believe we have found a successful solution in providing for the protective charges or ‘Eurotariff’ to be applied automatically to all users three months after the entry into force of the regulation, leaving users free to choose tariffs that they may think are better for them. In the future this will prevent users travelling abroad on business or on holiday from becoming victims of unfair charges, as is unfortunately the case today. The compromise will still leave a profit margin for operators, who may nonetheless benefit from increased mobile telephone use in the future. In the interests of greater transparency, I consider the requirement for operators to inform users by providing personalised information on their tariff plans to be an achievement. I am somewhat less convinced by the gradual reduction of tariffs spread over three years, although this is understandable in a spirit of compromise. Perhaps a more diligent market would have cut prices further than this regulation can do over three years. It is equally true, however, that where the market has failed through a lack of transparency about excessive prices and a presumed abuse of power, regulation of both wholesale and retail is not only desirable but absolutely necessary.

Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I will be brief. I deeply regret the decision to resort to urgent voting on the three framework programmes concerning the area of freedom, security and justice for the period from 2007 to 2013. While understanding the acute need to adopt the reports by the end of the year in order to allow the procedures for finance allocation to be started this coming 1 January, I believe that programmes of such importance at least deserved a debate in the Chamber. Since I was not given the opportunity previously, I now take the opportunity to thank all those who worked together with me for over a year and a half: as well as my staff, I thank my colleagues for their work and the officials of the group and the secretariat for their efforts.

Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I have already taken the floor on many occasions in this House in order to stress the urgent need for a common immigration policy, and I am pleased to note the recent initiatives undertaken at Community level and the recent release of funds intended for crisis-hit countries. The gradual realisation on the part of the Member States – which are now convinced, albeit belatedly perhaps, of the countless tragic deaths in the Mediterranean – that migration no longer just affects the States on the edge of the EU and that the general objectives of economic growth can only be achieved within a general climate of security is anything but trivial. This realisation may at last persuade them to take an equal share in the responsibility and financial burden of managing our borders. This is a real commitment, and it is also demonstrated by the increased financial resources that the EU will make available over the next seven years for the purposes of consolidating an area of freedom, security and justice. Another positive aspect is the creation of a specific programme aimed at controlling migratory flows with ad hoc
 funds intended for repatriations, refugees and integration. Equally important is the creation of a border management agency, which unfortunately still does not have enough staff, but I hope that it will gradually benefit from more attention and funds. I hope that, by taking this step, we will be able to create common minimum standards for combating illegal immigration and controlling legal immigration and that we will be able to draft a credible policy that respects the rights of individuals. However, a credible policy can only be rigorous; there is no place for a European policy that promotes mass legalisations and that indiscriminately hands out citizenship rights. It is widely known these days not only that legalisations do not allow problems to be resolved without immigrants' circumstances being improved, but that they nearly always exacerbate them instead, merely encouraging marginalisation and widespread crime, which often result in terrorism. Finally, being credible means reaffirming the ideals of solidarity and of safeguarding the EU’s own freedoms, and tying this to respect for the law. The EU will never refuse to help the needy and those who genuinely want to integrate, but when it comes to those who want to export violence, culture, values and religions, the 'zero tolerance' principle must take effect; we may not like it, but sometimes it is crucial.

 Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, notwithstanding my complete approval of UNIFIL 2, I must express my reservations about the actual mobilisation of the countries of Europe: apart from Italy, France and Spain, they will confine themselves to providing a more or less symbolic contribution. Europe’s appeals so far have been feeble; the High Representative for Common Foreign and Security Policy, Mr Solana, called for a strong response from all the countries of the Union, but his words have faded away in the air over Brussels. Even if I wanted to gloss over the veiled pro-Palestinian slant that pervades the European institutions and which sometimes seems to slide into anti-Semitism, I should in any case have to stress yet again how incapable Europe is: through trying to be politically correct as usual, it has been unwilling to adopt a clear, precise position. I wonder, however, how one can talk of equidistance. (The President cut off the speaker)

 Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I am delighted at the proposal for a regulation on common rules in the field of civil aviation security. If it is adopted, we can hope for greater cooperation within the Union, so that we can live in a more secure Europe. I endorse the idea of a single security system, the aim of which is to make further checks unnecessary if the Member States are reasonably sure that the basic security rules have been followed at the airport of origin. I am not overjoyed, however, that the opinion of the Committee on Civil Liberties, Justice and Home Affairs, for which I am the draftsman, and which was actually adopted by a very large majority, has not been taken into due consideration. I believe, in fact, that the Member States should keep the power to apply more stringent security measures both internally and in the context of bilateral relations with third countries, should they consider them necessary on the basis of legitimate risk assessments. Such more stringent measures should in all cases be proportionate and in keeping with civil liberties and free market principles, as in fact is pointed out in the opinion that I have drafted. While I believe that the Commission should confine itself to laying down minimum standards and carrying out checks by means of regular as well as unannounced inspections, I consider it excessive that the Commission should be able to decide by itself whether a State can continue to apply more stringent measures or not. In addition, I am consoled by the fact that, at least in the area of on-board measures, the Committee on Transport and Tourism has seen fit to take up my amendment extending the definition of ‘potentially disruptive passengers’ to people whose behaviour is a source of genuine concern. I am very pleased at the acceptance of my amendment calling on the Commission to draw up an annual report on the application of national security programmes. In short, I felt that the proposal needed to be accepted, including by the Committee on Transport and Tourism, as it aims at making the various programmes the subject of an annual report by the Commission to the European Parliament and the national parliaments, informing them of the application of the national security programmes as well as the results achieved by the new regulation.

Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, it is certainly a positive development that Parliament has given its verdict on the subject of Malta’s immigration centres and, what is more, only a few days after the visit by the Committee on Civil Liberties, Justice and Home Affairs, in which I was able to take part as a delegate. The resolution adopted, which is the product of the invaluable contribution of all the groups, exposes the seriousness of the situation for the refugees living in inhuman conditions, with virtually no basic sanitation or personal care. The resolution, however, makes it quite clear that Europe is highly responsible for what happens in Malta. It goes without saying that the delegation’s visits to reception centres throughout Europe are not intended for the purposes of rating centres as good or bad. However, the situation in Malta, although a far cry from that of Lampedusa in terms of the occupants’ living conditions, does call to mind that Italian island in terms of its size and reception capacity. I therefore urge the Council to adopt a clear and strong position so that, in line, of course, with the principle of solidarity, we arrive as quickly as possible at a common and fair immigration policy aimed at preventing the costs of these waves of illegal immigrants from burdening only the budgets of a few States on the periphery of southern Europe, which are totally unable to support themselves financially.

 Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I deplore the methods used to arrive at the drafting of the joint resolution. I consider it unacceptable that the talks were shamefully held in private, without the involvement of the group that I represent. I am well aware, of course, that all the political groups are equal, but evidently some are more ‘equal’ than others. My group firmly believes that there should be no room in a democracy for injustices or discrimination on the grounds of gender, race or religion. I have, however, felt it necessary to reject a resolution that is not mine and which, above all, contains paragraphs that in my view are inconsistent with the purpose of the document itself. I read that homosexuals should be fully recognised as victims of the Nazi regime: of course they were! Does that mean, however, that other persecutions were perhaps less serious? Are we forgetting the cruelty they suffered under Communist regimes, and under others too? Given that the freedom to express one’s own sexuality has to be guaranteed, I believe that it should always be exercised with respect for the values and principles that set our society apart. The family has always meant a father and a mother, a man and a woman, and I do not believe that the European Union, by promoting campaigns against hypothetical discrimination, can give itself the right to ride roughshod over national governments just to endorse the wishes of certain not exactly worthy lobbying groups. The European Union cannot act on matters of values, culture and the family as if it were dealing with the single market, asking the Member States to legalise homosexual unions for the sake of uniformity and a misplaced duty to protect people’s rights; instead, it would be running the risk of undermining the system of values that lies at the heart of our age-old society.

 Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, in view of the extremely serious matter raised by certain newspapers, and if what for now remains mere supposition or fantasy is actually confirmed, then I too consider that Parliament has a duty to play its part in shedding light on the matter and ensuring that there is complete transparency in the relations between the European Union and all non-EU countries. I believe, however, that it would have been more useful right now to spend our time debating more concrete facts. I do not want to go too far back in time, but I should like somebody to stand up and tell me whether in those days the United States trampled on the sovereignty of European Member States when it sacrificed thousands and thousands of its men to save Europe. It is always you on the left who remind me of such things. Well, then, are the people of the United States our friends or not? They cannot be our friends when it suits us and not our friends when it does not suit us. I still do not understand how even people who have important roles in the institutions and who ought to hold objective views and avoid making destabilising allegations can possibly utter such damning statements when there is actually no evidence for the events and, inter alia
, when the very countries involved deny any illegality. Nobody, of course, wants to deny Parliament’s crucial role in guaranteeing and monitoring respect for human rights and protection of the freedoms of individuals and peoples. Even so, nobody is authorised to hold court and to pass judgment based on suppositions and suspicions, just on the basis of some newspaper articles. Nonetheless, I declare myself in favour of setting up a working party to look into the matter more thoroughly, making use of the information supplied by the Council of Europe. According to the European Convention on Human Rights, the Council of Europe is the only institution charged with investigating possible human rights violations in the Member States. I would not want this whole attitude – this aversion to a country that is Europe’s friend – to be just the product of a perverse feeling, which is noticeable in the speeches of certain Members of this Parliament, although certainly not in my political group. To conclude, I sense that a veiled but widespread feeling of ideological anti-Americanism reigns in this Parliament, and especially in certain of its constituent committees. Certain groups seem to be permeated by a visceral, deep-seated anti-American, anti-Western feeling, which clearly reveals old Soviet friendships that have never dimmed. (Applause)

 Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, Parliament and the Council have made an admirable effort to reach agreement at first reading so that an urgent measure to tackle terrorism and crime can be adopted swiftly. I have always been of the opinion that, when faced with a recurrent threat to undermine world peace and stability, people will, under exceptional circumstances, willingly accept restrictions to their privacy if the other side of the coin is greater peace of mind and security. I believe that it is legitimate to temporarily restrict privacy when it may be for the good of society. I think we can in any case be pleased with the positive compromises that have been reached, despite the customary obstructionist attitude of a certain part of the Left, which often pays lip-service to safeguarding individual freedoms merely for convenience’ sake. It calls for freedom and security for the people but then does not follow it up with concrete action, thus showing that it is more interested in demagogy and facile propaganda. I think it has been shown that targeted, restrictive measures are needed in the fight against terrorism, in keeping with the principle of proportionality. The outcome of these negotiations will, in my opinion, be a directive of undoubted importance if it also includes the corrective measures on which the EU ministers have already reached agreement. The directive would combine rigour with the protection of civil liberties, by ruling that data may be retained for long periods, while, at the same time, containing a series of provisions designed to regulate aspects relating to protection, laying down penalties for those who use such data illegally. The directive would allow Member States to decide whether to retain data on unanswered calls, while providing for technical restrictions to keep down the cost of doing so. In this regard, I should like to mention the example of Italy, one of the few Member States already to have adopted specific legislation on data retention. Since Italy’s legislation is proving effective, I think it is acceptable for data to be retained for two years, if particular circumstances so require. I therefore hope that Italy, which is always willing to share its experience, can keep its own legislation in the context of the harmonisation of the various national systems. Its legislation has been proved effective and, above all, the Commission has acknowledged the fact by saying that Italy could submit a derogation notification.

 Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, first of all I must express my solidarity with Mrs Klamt, in view of the left’s unsuccessful attempt to sabotage the report in committee. As it is very clear that the amendments do not solve the problems and do not improve conditions for jobless immigrants, I agree with the rapporteur that mass regularisation is neither a way to control illegal immigration nor a way to recruit economic migrants; instead, it fuels marginalisation and widespread criminality. Although the ambitious proposal to set up a European ‘green card’ system is worth endorsing, a policy making entry more flexible for seasonal workers or for those with fixed-term employment will generate a catastrophic, unmanageable situation. For immigration to be a source of prosperity and development, rather than instability, there have to be stringent procedures and criteria. In addition to the immigrant having a sponsor and being able to demonstrate the ability to provide for his or her own upkeep, I believe further guarantees are needed. A job must be a sine qua non
 for a migrant to be admitted. Providing for derogations and exceptions is unacceptable. I hope the Commission will submit a consistent, pragmatic proposal containing precise, non-arbitrary conditions. Economic migration provides an opportunity for a country, but it cannot be a panacea for all ills, from an ageing population to a labour shortage. That is why my group, the National Alliance or the Union for Europe of the Nations Group, abstained from voting on this report.

Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, since I now know him well, I am willing to understand Mr Catania’s exaggerations, emphases and fantasies – which are all pessimistic, naturally. I will ask Mr Watson, instead, to verify his information before talking about the conduct of the Italian Government, so that he can avoid talking rubbish in this Chamber. In any case, Mr President, in the light of recent events in Ceuta and Melilla, I hope that all the Member States are finally becoming fully aware of the fact that illegal immigration is a European problem and that rigorous and concerted action on the immigration issue cannot be put off any longer, even for a second. I note with pleasure that the Commission, with a view to reinforcing the European area of freedom, security and justice, intends to allocate, for the 2007-2013 period, significant resources for the management of migratory flows, laying down specific measures to combat immigration and promote integration. I hope that, with the sums allocated for the strengthening of the external borders and for the creation of a European fund for refugees and another for those who are repatriated, an assessment will also be made of the possibility of upgrading reception centres along the model of the Lampedusa centre, which has been unfairly attacked by the left. Unfortunately I do not have the time to dwell on what Mr Zapatero has done in recent days, but it is true to say that, with a few rare exceptions, the left has not expressed itself on this subject with the same vehemence. Italy, which is already spending exorbitant amounts on repatriating illegal immigrants, can no longer bear the burdens and costs of these waves of immigration by itself. EU funding is needed to upgrade and set up new centres and to foster cooperation with the countries of origin, which is the most effective way to avoid cases such as Lampedusa, which is too often forced to tackle such severe overcrowding that it is almost impossible to manage. For that reason, and this is my final point, we should give our warm thanks to those who work at the Lampedusa centre – civilians, the forces of law and order, the police, the carabinieri
, religious workers and volunteers – for the humaneness and professionalism they display and the sacrifices they make every day. We should appreciate the fact, however, and for this I would like to thank the President, that Parliament has been willing to dedicate this time – which was not programmed – to such an important and sensitive topic.

 Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, first of all I should like to compliment the Council on its absence. I see that as symptomatic of the extent to which this Parliament is taken into account. Alas, poor us! Ladies and gentlemen, while I agree with the rapporteur in calling for greater cooperation among the institutions and in considering that Parliament should always be consulted before the Council comes to any kind of agreement, I should, however, like to express my disappointment at the contents of the report. In the document, the rapporteur laments the lack of significant progress in terms of harmonisation, but he does not take into account the different perceptions that countries can have about the immigration problem. When I speak of immigration, I deliberately call it a problem: there is no denying that the so-called fringe countries of the European Union suffer most from veritable assaults by immigrants, who sometimes arrive with good intentions, admittedly, but are none the less illegal. In the absence of a Community immigration policy, one that is both intelligent and practical, I consider it fair for the Member States to reserve the right to examine only those applications that are considered serious and possibly to reject them. Some Members, however, insist on wanting to consider immigration to be a non-Community problem; they imagine that the individual Member States should bear the exorbitant costs that these waves of migration involve. Some amendments that go against the Council proposals have been adopted. The definition of ‘safe third country’ has in effect been eliminated, preventing Member States from rejecting applicants deemed unsuitable even if they come from countries considered to observe freedoms and human rights. If this Parliament – perhaps because it is too politically correct – wishes to ignore the fact that immigrants, especially those who come through my own country, Italy, get into Europe and almost always end up committing crimes and jeopardising the safety of our citizens, then perhaps it would be better to have the courage to say that each country should regulate itself as it sees fit, that is to say with 20 different kinds of legislation. In that case, however, the Left should not go on about a united Europe: they are the only ones being hypocritical; we on the right are certainly not!

Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, first of all I congratulate the rapporteur on his enormous efforts in drafting the report, which I believe is still incomplete, however, and certainly not very effective. Protecting fundamental rights, which was a key element in the integration of Europe, and the Charter of Fundamental Rights, declared in Nice in 2000, confirm the importance, not to mention the necessity, of a coherent integration policy aimed at protecting minorities and encouraging the integration of non-EU citizens, particularly in the light of the recent enlargement. We are all agreed in saying that discrimination is a phenomenon that must be fought, that all men and women must enjoy equal rights and that no one must feel discriminated against on the grounds of race, ethnicity, religion or any other category. I believe, however, that the social inclusion of immigrants, and the protection of minorities and cultural diversity – priority objectives of the European Constitution – do not always have to be achieved at any price in every case. Allow me to express my doubts about those immigrant communities that show obvious signs of intolerance – not to say contempt – towards the host country, its customs, its history and its culture; about those who demand unwarranted autonomy and consider it their right to not respect the laws of the Member State in which they are staying, often illegally. They are the first not to want to integrate. Immigrants certainly need to be given legal status, allowing those whose situation is in order not to be discriminated against, on condition that they clearly demonstrate their willingness to integrate and to actively contribute to the economic and social development of their host country. In contrast, by guaranteeing every kind of right at any cost – systematically and unconditionally – there is the danger that the only ones who feel discriminated against will be European citizens, who carry out all of their fiscal and social obligations towards the State, respecting its rules. Finally, I must naturally declare my complete opposition to the paragraph on homophobia and gay couples, regarding ‘family’ only in the traditional sense: a male father, a female mother and children as they are born, male or female. The time allocated to me has unfortunately come to an end, but I would have liked to expand on such issues in this House, as I believe is necessary.

Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, I thank the rapporteurs who have gone before me and I can of course confirm that the Committee on Civil Liberties, Justice and Home Affairs endorses the measure. I nonetheless think it necessary to add some points: the ease and confidence with which the terrorists were able to strike in September 2001 and in other circumstances have created the need to extend security checks not only at airports and border points but also at ports, which record a significant flow of goods and passengers on a daily basis. With regard to the proposal of the Council and Parliament to additionally subject cargo ferries to checks, I, as draftsman of the opinion of the Committee on Civil Liberties, take the liberty of pointing out that a greater number of checks at ports would also make it possible to stem the trade in counterfeit goods, drugs trafficking and a long list of activities carried out by criminal organisations. My proposal, presented as an amendment in the Committee on Civil Liberties, was not accepted, in the same way that other amendments calling for the extension of checks to people, in addition to goods and vehicles, were not accepted. I truly believe this rejection to be incomprehensible, given that the objective was exclusively that of further safeguarding the safety of our citizens. Fortunately, subsequent discussions between the Council and Parliament confirmed the legitimacy of my argument and took note of it. The content of my amendments was added to the text, so that they have, in essence, been accepted. I believe that the directive can also act as a legitimate tool in the fight against illegal immigration, by restricting the entry of people who, arriving without jobs or any papers, and counting on straightforward social integration, very often are compelled to commit crimes in order to survive, sometimes even despite themselves.

On the other hand, I uphold Amendment 11, which refers to checks against drug trafficking, the counterfeiting of goods and above all against illegal immigration.

 Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I refer to an amendment that I have tabled to the resolution. Today, Europe is laying the foundations to create a climate of greater peace and tolerance. Declaring 27 January Holocaust Memorial Day in order to encourage people to learn about it shows our clear determination to overcome and to fight all forms of intolerance and racism. It is a move to which I of course fully subscribe. When we think of Holocaust Memorial Day, however, we cannot and must not fail to remember and similarly condemn other holocausts, which are perhaps less well known but certainly no less serious in terms of the crimes committed against humanity. I therefore confirm my full, wholehearted support for the document under discussion, which deplores any kind of racism or xenophobia and, in general, any form of persecution on ethnic or religious grounds, and likewise condemns those events that represent one of the greatest horrors in all the history of humankind: the Holocaust. I believe it is only right that Parliament should recall that, together with the Jews, other peoples and ethnic minorities who have been the victims of genocide and persecution must also not be forgotten, as unfortunately often happens. In my amendment, therefore, I have asked that the resolution should also mention the Armenians and the Kurds, the Italians slaughtered by Marshal Tito in Istria, and the millions of innocent people, among them Jews, who were exterminated in the Soviet gulags
 certainly in numbers no less vast than those killed by the German Nazis, as our Polish fellow Members have quite rightly pointed out.

Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I believe that it is a good thing that the European Parliament should act to ensure that freedom and justice prevail, not only in Europe – since in our continent too there are some countries where even today, unfortunately, freedom is lacking – but also throughout the world. I think that this is one of our duties, one of our principal goals. Therefore, I consider it our duty to take a particular interest in those areas where there is the greatest risk of the most fundamental human rights not being respected. Iran is certainly one of these areas and we must therefore consider our commitment to this country to be an absolute priority. I would like to add, however, that recent reports have on more than one occasion proved to be totally contradictory. This leaves us with a picture of the current situation without any definite certainties. I say ‘definite certainties’, because we certainly have some idea already. In these last few days, the Iranian authorities have stated that the information in our documents does not correspond to the truth. On this point, naturally, I cannot be in total agreement, but it seems likely that a few inaccuracies have been included. I certainly do not believe that we should take what the Iranian authorities say as the gospel truth, as we know that in the past, and perhaps now too, this country has certainly not distinguished itself for its transparency and democracy. I believe, however, although this is perhaps not complying precisely with the rules of this Chamber, that it would now be wise to propose a postponement of the vote on this resolution. We should delay voting to another part-session, obviously not very far in the future, when we have succeeded in obtaining rather more accurate data. I do not intend, moreover, to call into question everything said by the Iranian embassy. In fact, the Iranian embassy sent a letter to our President Mr Borrell yesterday – I have a copy of it – following up on correspondence with Mrs Svensson, in which it contests the content of our resolutions. I had thought that it was still not clear whether the death penalty was still inflicted on minors in Iran. According to the Iranian authorities, though, it would seem that in the last two years all capital punishment of minors has been suspended. In view of this, therefore, I propose that the vote be postponed to a later date, and that meanwhile we listen again to the Iranian authorities in order to have a more precise picture and to be able to reflect on our vote more calmly and collectedly. In any case, if we proceed to a vote, the UEN Group will obviously vote in favour of this resolution, while I will abstain in the light of what I have just said.

 Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, today we are approving a directive of considerable importance, a directive that concerns patients – as has already been pointed out – and all European citizens. On the very eve of the European elections, all European citizens can see, once again, how Parliament can have a positive effect on the life of each of them. The Charter of Fundamental Rights of the European Union establishes the right to healthcare and, with this directive, we are now giving substance to that right. It is an issue that concerns a huge number of citizens: a recent Eurobarometer survey showed that today 50% of European citizens are prepared to travel to receive treatment abroad, in the hope of finding better, faster treatment for their illness, and 74% of citizens feel that when they go abroad for treatment, this should be reimbursed by their own Member State. The area is currently governed by national laws, and citizens are poorly informed with regard to the options, reimbursement and possible treatment abroad. Indeed, today only 4% of European citizens are treated abroad. The European Union has uniform regulations only in cases of emergency healthcare treatment received abroad on the basis of the regulation on the European health insurance card. Today Parliament is granting European citizens’ request for health protection, and in the field of healthcare Europe is preparing to do away with borders and to enable all patients to choose where they receive treatment.

 Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I want to begin by thanking everyone who worked together so effectively in drafting this report: the shadow rapporteurs from the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Food Safety; the Czech Presidency; the European Commission officials and – last but not least – the admirable officials from all the political groups. I am grateful to them all for their excellent work. Their valuable contribution has made it possible to achieve agreement at first reading. When I took over responsibility on behalf of the European Parliament for reviewing the dossier on the eco quality labelling scheme, Ecolabel, I acted to speed up the system. Continually updating the environmental requirements for products that do not meet standards forces companies into an ongoing virtuous cycle that raises the overall eco quality standards of products placed on the market. By increasing the production and circulation of products and services with Ecolabel, we will obtain significant permanent and increasing environmental benefits in terms of energy saving, reducing atmospheric pollution and water saving. Ecolabel is a voluntary eco quality label that aims to promote the distribution of products and services with low environmental impact throughout their life cycles, offering consumers accurate, non-misleading and scientifically correct information. Our review of this regulation is part of a broader European action plan for sustainable production and consumption and it is closely linked to the review of EMAS and the Ecodesign directive. Community legislature already provides for this review of the regulation by stating that the system must be reviewed in the light of experience acquired and changed in order to increase its effectiveness, improve its planning and simplify its operation. The purpose of the label is to guide consumers towards products that are able to reduce environmental impact. To date, our experience with the Ecolabel has been patchy. On the plus side, an increasing number of companies are applying for quality certification in the most diverse sectors. They therefore recognise its selective and driving value – this certification is greatly appreciated by consumers who are more aware of the social responsibilities of companies. On the negative side, I can report some problems: the general public are barely aware of the label; the criteria soon become obsolete because the markets change so quickly; and the bureaucratic language deters operators from taking part. The new Ecolabel will take on a new guise in terms of its look and content. It will become more attractive and its scope will extend to new products: by 2015, we plan to increase the number of groups from the current 25 to twice that number, that is, 40-50 groups. Promotional campaigns are planned. We have earmarked a marketing budget of EUR 9.5 million, and EUR 15 000 have been allocated for a new internet site. The principle that most interested the shadow rapporteurs and found the other institutions in agreement was the fact that the Ecolabel must not simply certify an achieved result but instead must be a dynamic tool that is continually developing, a driving force that continually pushes manufacturers and products towards higher standards of environmental quality by continuously evaluating market benchmarks and establishing new criteria on their basis. Our aim is to guarantee control of the entire product life cycle, which will allow us fully to consider environmental impact at all stages of production and allow all operators in the sector, and also NGOs, to play an active part in the process of reviewing the compromise criteria.

 Mr President, Minister, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, I also welcome the opportunity to thank all those who took part in the debate, which revealed broad agreement over the work carried out in the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Food Safety. The debate also offered more insights, additional stimuli and further suggestions that I hope will be valuable to the Commission and Member States as they fulfil their duties. By carrying out this debate and taking the vote today, Parliament has practically fulfilled its commitment on these two important matters. Now it is the turn of the Commission to have its say: I was delighted to hear the three statements made on the record by the Commissioner. We expect the Commission to perform its study on food very specifically so that any possibility of misunderstandings between this label and organic products can be ruled out. We look forward to the regulation on fish products – and the Committee on Fisheries awaits it with particular eagerness. I thank the Committee on Fisheries for helping us through this very difficult time. I call the Commission’s attention to the exemptions for toxic products: proceed with great care and great caution. As far as the promotional campaign is concerned, we hope that the Commission’s campaigns are effective and targeted in order to reach the general public and particularly young people. We hope that the firm deadlines we tried to establish will be respected and that the reduction in animal testing will also be respected. I am left with just one small concern and regret: perhaps we could have done more about contracts. That is a job for next time.

 Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I wholeheartedly support any initiative aimed at developing the Union for the Mediterranean. From this perspective, I hope to see the parliamentary role of the Euro-Mediterranean Parliamentary Assembly strengthened, including by stepping up the Assembly’s relations with the Mediterranean partners and enabling it to make recommendations to meetings of Foreign Ministers and to participate as an observer at meetings of Heads of State or Government, ministerial meetings and preparatory meetings held by senior officials. I would like to emphasise the need to strengthen the role and initiatives of the Facility for Euro-Mediterranean Investment and Partnership and to create a Euro­Mediterranean Investment Bank, which was announced some time ago but which has not yet been carried out. I support the proposal to create a Euro-Mediterranean Regional and Local Assembly along the lines of similar, European, institutions, in order to involve regions and cities further, and a Euro-Mediterranean Economic and Social Committee to involve the social partners and civil society. I also welcome the proposal to establish a Euro-Mediterranean Energy Community within the framework of a policy aimed at implementing large-scale projects in the fields of renewable energy and energy infrastructure. Furthermore, I hope that the Union will play an ever-more effective role in the search for peace, in conflict resolution, in the strengthening of democracy, in the defence of religious freedom and in the fight against terrorism, drug trafficking, organised crime and people trafficking. Lastly, the Union cannot evade the task of taking concerted action with the states involved to manage migratory policies and flows in the Mediterranean area. It can no longer focus solely on security, the rule of law and repressing illegal immigration, but must also, and above all, direct its attention to active policies, sources of shared rules and targeted and sustainable employment.

 Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, the sexual exploitation of children is a terrible problem. It is a disgrace of today’s world and a grave sign of our decline. A sharp increase has been observed in recent times, due to the vertiginous spread of the Internet and of new and sophisticated technologies to which children are exposed and to which they have access, without any limits, rules, controls or penalties. These are now more urgently required than ever, and must be applied in an increasingly efficient and exemplary fashion. Mrs Angelilli’s excellent report, on which I warmly congratulate her, and the specific recommendations that Parliament will make to the Commission, indicate and suggest measures that can genuinely curb the spread of child pornography, online grooming of children, sex tourism and all forms of child abuse. Recent disturbing data, including a UN study on violence against children, indicate that sexual exploitation of children is rapidly increasing and that, together with people trafficking, it is becoming one of the major sources of profit and one of the fastest growing crimes at transnational level, with a yearly turnover of approximately USD 10 billion. According to an estimate by the International Labour Organisation, more than 12 million people are victims of forced labour, of whom more than 1 million are involved in sexual exploitation and between 45% and 50% are children.

 Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, obesity is becoming a serious and, I would say, major problem throughout Europe, particularly among the young. According to the experts, if we want to look after the health of our children, the best way to achieve this is to return to the traditions of Mediterranean cuisine on a daily basis, the only life insurance that financial crises can never affect. The approach of Alfonso Iaccarino, a well-known Italian chef and member of the expert committee on the recognition of the Mediterranean diet as Intangible Cultural Heritage of Humanity, is to return to natural, simple foods and to tradition, diversity and quality in cooking. The Mediterranean diet is not just a lot of bread and pasta, it also involves movement, physical activity and lifestyle. The Mediterranean diet, based on extra-virgin olive oil and good wine, has an excellent effect on health: olive oil reduces blood cholesterol levels and wine, in moderation, has an antioxidant effect. The Mediterranean diet has helped Italians break the record for longevity in Europe and Italy leads the ranking for best body mass index, which is the relationship between height and weight. In conclusion: the Italian Senate recently unanimously approved a paper in favour of the recognition of the Mediterranean diet as heritage of humanity. I hope that the European Parliament is of the same opinion and that the Commission acts accordingly. (The President cut off the speaker)

 Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, I would not be as pessimistic as Mrs Lucas, who spoke before me. I would like to thank the rapporteur, Commissioner Dimas and the French Presidency, because this is undeniably another success for its term of office. I believe that the approval of the climate and energy package and of this directive is an extremely positive thing. Europe can now call itself the world leader in the fight against climate change. We have the right credentials to go to Copenhagen next year with authority and in a position of strength, able to ask all the other countries of the world to do as Europe has done. I would particularly like to point out the positive role played by Italy, and this is not a contradiction: Italy had no desire to withdraw, or to obstruct the ambitious targets we had together set ourselves, but at the same time we had a duty to defend our national manufacturing system. As President Sarkozy said this morning, Europe cannot be formed against the Member States and against national interests; a compromise was necessary and we are certain we have achieved it.

 Madam President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, Mr Schulz will be pleased to hear that I do not intend to speak French. That, however, does not prevent me from unreservedly backing President Sarkozy's initiative, which has pushed – or even propelled – Europe into a position from where it can reclaim a vital role in the Mediterranean area. The merit of the Sarkozy initiative is that it responds to the question of outcomes from the Barcelona Process in anything but a tame manner. Whenever we ask ourselves what the Mediterranean has gained from the Barcelona Process, our objective, serious and truthful answer is inevitably unsatisfactory. There has of course been the war, and there is still conflict in the Middle East. When it was decided in Barcelona in 1995 to launch this new European policy, the idea was to manage the post-conflict peace. That was not the case then and is not now. Europe is still dragging its feet, and the French President's initiative strikes us as well-timed. We endorse the Commission's initiative and the compromise which has emerged from it. We back it, yet we believe that it is still insufficient with regard to the role that Europe can and must play in the Mediterranean. Some people feared, and still fear, that the French initiative might jeopardise European cohesion; I do not believe there is any such danger. No such danger exists whenever Europe is asked to focus more on politics and less on the market.

 Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, waste to energy units are operational in Italy and the rest of Europe. Separate collections are made in Italy and the rest of Europe. Recycling takes place in Italy and the rest of Europe. Only in Naples has this not been the case for at least the last 15 years, under the noses of all the institutions which should have acted: those institutions include Europe and the Commission. I take the view that little has been done and more needs to be done, by the Commission as well, because the initiatives taken up to now, including in recent days, by the government are completely ineffectual and unfit for purpose. Sending the chief of police to Naples for only four months will not resolve any problem unless Naples complies with all the European laws, and if the Italian Government is unable to make it comply, let the European Commission do so with all the instruments that it has available.

 Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, the issue addressed by Mr Cappato’s report is extremely delicate and requires careful appraisal by the European Parliament to avoid putting forward misguided and disastrous solutions, albeit motivated by good intentions. I wish to highlight two points. Firstly, to increase the production of opium and its derivatives in Afghanistan could compromise the country’s reconstruction and the already difficult stabilisation of the rule of law in that unfortunate region. Secondly, the increasing production of opium – up by 30% this year – has not been matched by an adequate anti-drugs strategy. For these reasons I think the proposal put forward in the report is absolutely unacceptable, and I would stress that: 1. the necessary quantities of morphine are already being produced in Afghanistan under special licences and subject to supervision by the United Nations drugs agency and the Afghan Government’s Ministry of Counter Narcotics; 2. the International Narcotics Control Board maintains that there is already a worldwide surplus of opiates for medical use; 3. large-scale legal production of morphine would lead to more drugs being produced; these would ultimately meet the demand for drugs on the world market. Once they were placed on the market cheaply they would be available to all. We should instead oppose drugs – always and in every case and by all means – from production, to trafficking, to illegal distribution. Demand should be curbed through a value-based policy and through ongoing, widespread prevention work and information campaigns, especially among young people. In a country like Afghanistan, given the conditions in which it currently finds itself, the solution proposed by this report could be regarded as an indication of surrender and defeat; it could also thwart the efforts being made by the international community, the European Union, the United Nations and the reconstruction agencies in Afghanistan through programmes to diversify away from opium plantations and into other crops, supported by financial incentives. Finally I would just mention that the International Narcotics Control Board has approved the Afghan Government’s decision rejecting the proposal to legalise illicit opium poppy cultivation and reiterating its commitment to comply with its international treaty obligations.

 I question the reasoning behind the Commission’s action which, despite the quite appealing appearance of concern for the simplification of administration, is liable to take less account of the specific details of certain modes of production. I also find it regrettable that neither my fellow Members of the Committee on Agriculture and Rural Development nor I have had the time to study, under the right conditions, the Commission’s proposal, as a consequence of the diabolical timetable laid down by the Presidency of the Council. This whole process was worthy of being considered in greater depth within the European institutions, and I find it regrettable that more time could not have been found for a subject of such fundamental importance. It is for that reason I decided to abstain from the final vote.

Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, with all respect to the multitude of authoritative jurists with which the Committee on Legal Affairs is swarming, more modestly, I believe that if this Chamber were to approve the Gargani report tomorrow, the European Parliament would be committing a very serious and unprecedented act. It would be an unheard-of abuse of a Member who would see himself illegitimately deprived of his parliamentary mandate, and an unprecedented and unique breach of the treaties which, on electoral matters, clearly recognise the pre-eminence of the laws, procedures and authority of the Member States. This would be a serious conflict with a Member State, which would be deprived of a Member recognised as such by the laws and the legal authority of that country. Mr President, the Committee on Legal Affairs has usurped powers that do not belong to it. I do not side with either of the two contenders. I am politically indifferent because they are both from the centre left; I understand Mr Occhetto’s personal problem, for which I have empathy in purely human terms. What is at stake here, though, is the law, the correct composition of the European Parliament and the credibility of the highest Community institution. Justice, and only justice, must therefore be done, and any hint of politics and petty political party calculations must be left aside. What sort of trust can the citizens place in a European Parliament that distorts its own composition by excluding a Member who is eminently qualified to be a part of it? Let us look at the facts: the legal authority proclaimed Mr Donnici as the successful candidate, in an unappealable judgment. The Italian State notified the European Parliament of his election. The committee was charged with verifying Mr Donnici’s credentials. It was supposed to verify the offices he held and any incompatibility in them. It is of course true that it could examine appeals by third parties and therefore it legitimately examined the challenges put forward by Mr Occhetto. What it could not do was to declare null and void an act delivered before a public official of a Member State. This is a legal act that may be carried out solely by the legal authority of the Member State that has dealt with the matter and that has handed down an irrevocable and unappealable judgment.

I should like to begin by highlighting the effective work done by the rapporteur, Mrs Gebhardt, who has ensured that the adopted text is markedly better than Mr Bolkestein’s initial draft. Nevertheless, even though her work was remarkable, I voted in favour of the amendment to reject this directive and of the amendments that I co-signed, together with those tabled by the Group of the Greens/European Free Alliance and the Confederal Group of the European United Left/Nordic Green Left, because the text at second reading does not go as far as the one at first reading. Many grey areas remain in the text, and they would have needed to be clarified before we were able to accept such an important text as this, which involves the future of the people of Europe. Furthermore, certain services, such as services of general interest, have not been removed from the framework of this directive, and this could lead to wayward paths being taken. I feel that the Court of Justice and the Commission have been given too much influence over the control of the Member States and the interpretation of the directive. The legislator gives more than its due to the government of the courts.

 Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, the draft resolution on the conclusion of the Stabilisation and Association Agreement with the Republic of Albania should be considered extremely carefully and extremely positively. I should like to announce that the Union for Europe of the Nations Group will vote for the resolution, and it is warmly welcomed by the Italian National Alliance delegation. It is well known that Italy is watching the progress of the young Republic of Albania closely, favourably and with interest, especially since the clear and reassuring victory of President Berisha. This agreement will promote increasingly strong and extensive contractual relations between Albania and the European Union; it will certainly promote political, economic and institutional stability in that country; and it will promote Albania’s transition both towards a full, pluralist democracy that respects the rule of law, and towards a market economy. The main benefits of the agreement are the creation of a free trade zone, a serious commitment to cooperation in areas of mutual interest and, above all, the promotion of a more stable legal environment that will reassure foreign investors. It is well known that, during the previous period from 1997 to 2005, the government’s stranglehold on political and economic power stifled the market economy and constrained the fabric of society, in which tolerance and permissiveness went hand in hand with corrupting and sometimes Mafia-like methods. Much more needs to be done, and Albania has done much more, for instance in stopping and pursuing smugglers and preventing the traffic in human beings between Albania and Italy. This fight against corruption and organised crime needs to continue. Albania must invest heavily in infrastructure, transport and tourism, but the Commission must do more as well: it must provide more resources, particularly for transport and corridor 8, since the importance of infrastructure networks should be considered a necessary condition for development and cohesion. Such networks potentially allow access to all parts of the country, and so each area will be able to make the best use of its resources, process them and sell its products on the market.

 Madam President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, I should like, firstly, to extend a warm and affectionate welcome to our Bulgarian and Romanian parliamentary colleagues, as observers. Commissioner, our group is particularly appreciative not only of your speech but also of the systematic dialogue and discussion between Parliament and the Commission. With regard to the accession of Bulgaria and Romania into the European Union, I should like to remind our observers that there is a very substantial majority in this Parliament in favour of their two countries. For us, it is not so much an enlargement as a reunification with countries of an unquestionably European tradition. Here in Parliament there is even a majority in favour of the accession of Turkey, so it is hardly surprising that there is also a majority favourable and attentive to your membership. However, the Commissioner's report highlighted real grounds for concern: to put it light-heartedly, I hope that the lateness of the Commissioner’s arrival here today (albeit amply justified) is not a foretaste of delays in the accession of our two brother counties to the European Union. However, problems do exist. There is no doubt – as already emphasised and now reiterated by us in this Chamber – that progress, even substantial progress, has been made. We are fully aware of the state and condition your countries were in after years of an oppressive leftist regime. We know the problems you have had to face in the past and therefore are highly appreciative of the progress you have made, although there are still serious problems which have to be solved – and solved quickly – if we are to avoid forcing the European Union into something I hope does not occur, namely a deferral of entry by one year or possibly more. Our wish is for both Bulgaria and Romania to join the European Union in 2007. However, some problems have to be solved – and solved by you. The observers at today’s session should take away with them Parliament's goodwill but also its concerns. There is much you can do in your own countries to move the reform process further forward. The delays that still exist must be eliminated, particularly in the areas of corruption and internal security. The events of recent days give us all cause for great concern in the areas of the environment and health, and there are worries on the conditions of the external borders. We therefore invite you to take up this great challenge, because we want to have you here with us in 2007.

 Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, first of all I should like to thank the Commission for the good work it has done, for defining the special nature of the outermost regions better, and for meeting the needs of those areas, which suffer particularly from their geographical location in terms of development and market competitiveness. It is good that increasingly effective measures in support of those regions are being assessed and that a wider neighbourhood action plan is also foreseen in the Marques report, to encourage trade between those regions and their adjacent markets. The wider neighbourhood action plan is a good opportunity both to establish economic, social and cultural links with those countries that host emigrant communities from the outermost regions and to bring down the barriers that limit trading opportunities with the surrounding geographical areas, such as the West Indies, the Americas and Africa. In its communication COM(2004)0343
 of 26 May 2004, the Commission set itself two goals: to reduce the difficulties of access to the outermost regions, not just in relation to continental Europe but also from one region to another, and to improve the competitiveness of businesses. This is the goal we must achieve: help them to grow so we can all grow. That, if you like, is also the meaning of the Lisbon Strategy. In the present context, however, efforts must first be directed towards having some certainty on the financial perspective, because only then will we be able to judge whether the funds available to the regions will allow for the fair distribution of resources in line with the requirements that the Commission has outlined. In conclusion, then, I welcome a greater commitment to the outermost regions and a stronger partnership for these regions, so as to enable them to escape from isolation and to make them increasingly competitive on the common market.

Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, I too should like to congratulate the rapporteurs for the fine work carried out. Article 160 of the Treaty establishing the European Community stipulates that the European Regional Development Fund contributes to correcting the main regional imbalances existing within the Community, by participating in the development and the structural improvement of regions lagging behind in development, as well as in the restructuring of industrial regions in decline. Regional policy therefore represents a chance and an opportunity that we must not waste and that must be managed in the best way possible. I refer in particular to the southern regions of Italy, which come under the former Objective 1, now termed the ‘Convergence’ objective, which still have enormous problems and lag seriously behind in many sectors. Regional policy can genuinely be very useful for those regions, even if a number of mistakes from the past need to be corrected. At times we did not utilise all of the resources at our disposal and at other times we utilised them in the least appropriate manner. Mr Fava’s report, with which I agree, seeks to adjust this perspective, by focusing on knowledge, research and development, therefore ... (The President cut off the speaker)

. Tomorrow we shall be voting in favour of the resolution, and we applaud the signature of the Treaty and the subsequent accession of Bulgaria and Romania to the European Union. Since 1989, all successive Romanian Governments have set as their sole and overriding aim the country’s accession to the European Union. The path has been tortuous and difficult, but there is no doubt that significant progress has been made. Above all, in recent years the Bucharest Government has made great strides. The Commission is aware of this and, in its 1997 report on compliance with the political criteria, acknowledged the huge reform efforts made by that country – the consolidation of democracy, the rule of law and respect for minorities, as well as reforms in the area of public administration. Problems undoubtedly still exist, but we must have confidence.

 Mr President, Parliament is being called on to vote tomorrow to choose the European Ombudsman for the coming term. We are all aware that the Committee on Petitions has done its work commendably and has given Parliament a list of just two names. Then, last week, we all received some substantial, highly detailed correspondence making very serious allegations about matters that came to light after the committee hearings, which would raise major doubts about the eligibility of one of the two candidates. It seems likely that there has been an infringement of Article 195(3) of the Treaty, which states that the Ombudsman may not engage in any other occupation, whether gainful or not. The correspondence also raised questions relating to one of the qualifications obtained by the candidate in question, and it would also seem that the candidate had broken the rule of being completely independent by taking part in a lobby. Our request, Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, would allow the Committee on Petitions to carry out further checks so that this Parliament can vote with complete peace of mind: there must be no doubts or reservations about either candidate.

 The aim of this proposal for a regulation, namely to guarantee a Community control system for ensuring compliance with the rules of the Common Fisheries Policy through a European Agency, is certainly commendable and addresses the numerous demands made over the years by Parliament and the European Commission. The regulation also suggests – albeit timidly – implementing and applying the aforesaid rules in a uniform manner in the 27 Member States. Although I endorse the overall spirit of the text (maintaining a culture of respect for the rules in order to ensure that the Common Fisheries Policy is properly applied), I feel that on this occasion the specific characteristics of Mediterranean fishing have unfortunately not been taken into account. Just one example of this is the requirement to install a satellite-based vessel monitoring system (VMS) on vessels more than 10 meters long. This may be all very well for the robust North Sea fishing boats, but not for those of the Mediterranean, which are small, often without a cabin, and are used for ‘small-scale fishing’. This also poses the problem of the substantial costs to be borne, which could, however, be overcome if the Community were to provide 80% co-financing, as appropriately suggested in Amendment 20.

 Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, any initiative aimed at combating discrimination of any kind must be supported. Recent statistics show that in Europe, where society is so advanced, a minority of citizens say they have suffered discrimination. No one, therefore, can remain indifferent. However, the concept itself remains so wide and abstract that some clarification would be desirable. Without prejudice to fundamental human rights, which remain unquestionable, we cannot fail to recognise the sovereignty of each Member State to legislate in line with age-old traditions, civilisations and cultures. Intervention of this kind is almost always a case of safeguarding a population’s identity. Let me give an example relating to sexual orientation: it is my personal opinion, but I believe that human dignity must be guaranteed irrespective of sexual preference. Homosexuality is a choice that pertains to the private sphere and must under no circumstance be punished, but nor must it be protected. Freedom of opinion: where does protection against direct and indirect discrimination begin, and where does it end? Freedom of religion: at my niece’s school, for the first time this year, there was no nativity play. The head teacher banned it because there were children of other religious faiths present. In my view, since the nativity play is a demonstration of culture more than faith, in order to prevent one form of discrimination, another was created. Having respect for other people’s religion does not mean, Mr President, that we should be ashamed of our own! That is why – I shall finish here – our fear is that this proposal for a directive tends towards unnecessary reverse extremism, and the cure could prove worse than the original problem.

 Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, 14 years on from the Barcelona conference and the launch of the Euro­Mediterranean partnership, the balance seems entirely unsatisfactory. Shall we assess the results achieved thus far in relation to the financial commitments made? I believe it is Parliament’s legitimate right and the Commission’s duty to do so. Shall we pretend not to know that civil rights are completely unprotected in that Euro-Afro-Asiatic region? That equal opportunities are still lacking? That respect for religious freedom is still a dream? That economic and social growth are still marking time, while people trafficking grows at an alarming rate, increasing the flow of illegal immigrants, above all on the coast in my local area, in southern Italy, and Sicily? Under these circumstances, rather than representing an opportunity, creating a free trade area will accentuate the divide between rich and poor regions. To conclude, Madam President, although we have doubts about paragraphs 29 and 36, my group voted in favour of the report on the Barcelona process as an act of hope in the face of so much scepticism.

 Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, the decision by the European Union to support the recognition of the Mediterranean diet as Cultural Heritage of Humanity by UNESCO reminds us, above all, of the right to protection of the identities of peoples in their close relationship with their lands. However, the institutional commitment displayed by Italy, Spain, Greece and Morocco cannot be limited solely to achieving this prestigious recognition. I think that we must reconstruct the link, nowadays increasingly weak and fragile, between agricultural produce and food for everyday consumption; that is to say, we must encourage consumers to be knowledgeable about the principles of a healthy diet and the seasonality of produce. Produce must return to being natural and free from additives and chemical preservatives. The international scientific community assures us that the consumption of such produce significantly reduces mortality rates. I am thinking, for example, of extra-virgin olive oil, wine and fruit and, in particular, Sicilian blood oranges, unique in the world for their pigment that is rich in antioxidants. In conclusion, I hope this objective can be shared with other Mediterranean countries and, as a specific strategy is required, only the Commission can take a lead role and act as interpreter in this.

 Mr President, Mr Tajani, ladies and gentlemen, 40 000 deaths a year is a horrifying statistic. If not yet a disaster, road deaths are certainly an extremely serious social phenomenon, in the face of which Member States can often do no more than keep discouraging records and generate alarming statistics. It is the product of greater personal mobility, some will say; it is the product of increasing mechanisation, some will say. Of course, but it is also the consequence of a dilatory policy of prevention on the one hand and repression on the other by Member States and, indeed, the European Union, which up to now has been unable to secure a common road safety policy. A recent survey conducted by the Italian office of statistics found that, in 2007, night-time accidents between Friday night and Sunday morning accounted for 44% of all road accidents in Italy. The irresponsible behaviour of those who get behind the wheel is, however, unfortunately not limited to any one country, so it is crucial that we examine this proposal for a directive, which attempts to discourage car drivers from committing road traffic offences wherever they may be, with the aim of halving the number of deaths on the road by 2010. This is a good thing, but in at least some cases further improvements are required. Let me give just one example: the follow-up of offences. My opinion, Mr Tajani, is that we should follow Switzerland’s example. In Switzerland anyone who commits a road traffic offence is stopped a few kilometres later by a traffic patrol and one of two things happens: either the driver pays the fine immediately or their car is confiscated until the penalty is paid. I am perfectly aware that such a policy is not easy to implement and that it may seem drastic, but it is undoubtedly effective, and, moreover, we all know that you cannot cure cancer with an aspirin, and it is metastases we are now facing. Mrs Ayala Sender’s report is nonetheless a good report and will of course receive my support.

The problems of water scarcity and droughts, which are directly related, affect many parts of southern Europe in particular, with disastrous consequences for the environment and for local inhabitants. The region I come from, Sicily, suffers periods of water stress and drought every year on a regular basis, resulting in severe damage to agriculture. This is an alarming problem, which could partly be solved if energetic action were taken on at least two fronts. The first concerns infrastructure: on the island of Sicily, for example, a good deal of water – estimated to be as much as 30% – is lost owing to poor maintenance of the water mains. The second concerns prevention: I fully agree with the rapporteur when he states that training and education by means of information campaigns, beginning in schools, are crucially important so as to bring about a change in behaviour and create a culture of saving water and consuming it efficiently.

 Fisheries and aquaculture are two of the principal activities underlying the economic and social development of the coastal zones of the European Union. It is therefore necessary to manage them in such a way as to ensure sustainable exploitation of fisheries whilst also satisfy the increasing demand for fisheries products. To that end, the EU states need to implement a series of measures aimed at protecting coastal zones and promoting a clean marine environment. In view of the cross-border nature of many coastal processes, there is a need for cooperation between Member States and between them and neighbouring third countries. One such measure concerns the planning of housing developments for tourism purposes. For many regions, the tourism industry is an important contributor to local GDP. However, I think that we should support ‘eco-friendly’ tourism, in other words a form of tourism which dovetails with countryside and environment protection policies. There is also a need for coordination in terms of industrial activities: just think of the importance of an effective common policy on waste water management for ensuring the compatibility of an important economic activity with the need and duty to preserve the marine environment. Inshore, small-scale fishing is a very important source of income for thousands of families and keeps alive a centuries-old tradition which, in my view, Europe should support and preserve.

Fuel oil prices in Italy have risen by 240% in four years owing to strong speculation by the oil companies. This is preventing the fishing fleet – especially small-scale operators – not only from plying its trade but even from offsetting its high management costs. Europe's marine industries are on the verge of collapse, and the high cost of fuel oil is eroding the narrow economic margins available to fishermen. France and Italy have announced a joint initiative to apply for additional resources from the European Union. The main idea is to double the national threshold for de minimis
 aid to the sector. Such a measure would nonetheless be insufficient to obviate the serious difficulties besetting the fisheries sector, which has moreover already been facing a crisis. The European Commissioner for Fisheries, Joe Borg, considers that rapid aid is a possibility but also maintains that, in the long term, the solution to the crisis in the sector lies in restructuring the fleet, making it smaller and less energy-intensive. Although I can go along with the proposal to use vessels which guzzle less oil, it still remains urgently necessary to find fair ways of helping fishermen overcome this grave crisis and of rescuing numerous families from the threat of appalling poverty.

 Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, the insertion of the new Article 149 into the Treaty of Lisbon constitutes recognition of the major economic and social role played by sport. The detailed report by Manolis Mavrommatis highlights the numerous areas of life affected by sport, and I should like to look at just a few of them. The first is the relationship between sport and health: although everyone is well aware by now that physical activity is essential in order to remain in good shape, there is a worrying tendency in certain EU Member States to reduce the number of hours devoted to sport in schools. This trend, combined with a poor diet, is creating an army of obese youngsters, with the possibility of negative repercussions on their physical condition. Sport is an original and enjoyable way to learn a language. Back in the early 1970s I learned of a very well-organised and widespread system of study vacations in the United Kingdom geared to learning the language of Shakespeare through the practice of various sporting disciplines. Sport ought to support brotherhood among nations, but unfortunately that is not always the case: we regularly witness scenes of indescribable violence inside and outside of stadiums, especially in the case of football. Amateur and professional sport, uncontaminated and unpolluted sport, sport as a personal development tool, an instrument of cohesion and solidarity among peoples: we are still a long way away from satisfactory standards in Europe, Mr President, and the responsibility lies entirely with politics. We can only hope that the White Paper on Sport will act as a wake-up call and reverse the trend once and for all, so as to make up for an excessive lack of sensitivity and too many sins of omission.

 Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, I believe that the motion for a resolution on the regional impact of earthquakes addresses for the first time, in a logical and coherent fashion, the issue of seismic vulnerability in parts of the Union and consequently the remit of civil protection services. I therefore say to the rapporteur: praise where praise is due! I am fascinated by, and directly involved in, this matter, living as I do in the European region at greatest risk of seismic and volcanic activity: Sicily, at the foot of Mount Etna. I had the honour of serving as the Italian Government's commissioner for emergencies recently during a serious eruption of that volcano. I am therefore familiar with the problem at close quarters, and I also know how behind the times Italy is when it comes to risk forecasting and prevention, and not just seismic risk of course. Europe, too, lags a long way behind on this front, however. I have, for example, been calling on Parliament and the Commission for years to establish a European Civil Protection Agency responsible for coordinating the Member States' emergency management services and drawing up a uniform policy on prevention, forecasting and training for staff and volunteers. Today's resolution appears to go in that direction at long last. If the truth be told, the European Union as a whole still lacks a culture of civil protection, which often remains nothing more than the subject of round tables and electoral promises, even though what is at stake is the right of each and every one of us to safety. Before asking local actors, provinces, municipalities and regions for concrete examples, Europe should demonstrate that it wishes to turn the page at last, and I believe that this resolution could constitute the first proper step in that direction.

 Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, one year on from the last resolution adopted by this House on EU-Turkey relations, it is sad to see that certain fundamental issues remain tragically topical. Turkey does not recognise Cyprus, to all intents and purposes a Member State of the European Union; freedom of the press is still curtailed, since Article 301 of the Penal Code has not yet been amended and Turkey persists in not acknowledging the genocide of the Armenian population in 1915. The recent appalling terrorist attack by the PKK, the ensuing robust response from the Turkish army and the threat to intervene in the northern part of Iraq unless the PKK ends its terrorist activities once and for all: these factors compound the dangerous and delicate geopolitical position in which Turkey finds itself. Some progress has of course been made. I am thinking in particular of the increased representation of women in the newly elected Turkish Parliament, in economic circles and in the academic world, but we need to ask ourselves now more than ever whether the Europe of tomorrow wishes to be a large political entity or to have a strong cultural identity, because these uncertainties play into the hands of Turkey which does not wish to stop being itself.

The terrible fires which struck Greece and southern Italy in particular this summer, leaving victims in their wake and destroying thousands of hectares of woodland and agricultural land, again highlight the urgent need for better coordination of rapid reaction measures by Member States’ civil protection forces. To that end, it is now clear that a European Civil Protection Agency
 needs to be set up to coordinate and manage measures to eradicate or prevent the causes of disasters. That Agency – which the writer has proposed that the Commission set up on a number of occasions, on the basis of the positive experience of the US Federal Emergency Management Agency
 – would not just be responsible for combating the devastating fires that cause enormous damage every year in the Mediterranean countries, but would also take swift action to tackle the emergencies following on from all kinds of disasters brought about by natural events, such as the floods from which Bulgaria has recently suffered, or man-made events. It has to be stressed that disasters may be supranational in nature, and Europe should not just rely solely on the generosity of volunteers or on the competences and resources of the particular State that has been affected, but should have enough human and financial resources and appropriate equipment to enable swift action to be taken.

Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, the last serious and very recent case of widely-consumed counterfeited goods – a toothpaste containing antifreeze, sold on the European market and produced in China – brings back into the limelight the problem of combating ‘multinational forgery’. It is in this large Asian country, where de facto 
slavery is permitted for workers deprived of any sort of protection, that most of the products of the counterfeiting industry are concentrated –
 medicines, cosmetics and food products, as well as toys and items of clothing containing carcinogenic chemical substances that are strictly prohibited in the European Union. Unfortunately, this is a phenomenon that, while until a few years ago was restricted to high-end products (luxury lotions, perfumes, watches and bags), is now expanding to include products within the reach of an ever-growing number of users, leading to a high risk for consumer health. Today, more than ever, it is necessary for the political and industrial West to adopt a strong position towards powerful, wealthy China. On the one hand, we need to step up coordination between the Member States in inspections of imported products and, on the other hand, we need to persuade the Chinese Government to apply wide-scale, very strict on-the-ground, checks in order to protect European industry from unfair competition resulting partly from counterfeiting and piracy.

Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, Europe – and in particular southern Europe – has suffered for years from a low birth rate, or even negative population growth, as is the case in Italy. There are many, varied reasons why the cradles of our towns are remaining empty for too long: the ever-increasing cost of living, with which wages are not keeping step, and the late entry of young people onto the employment market, partly due to the wish and the need to study longer in order to become more competitive in a society that is ever more demanding. The ambitious goal, which is not an easy one to meet, is therefore not only that of reconciling young people’s right to further education and training with their aspirations to create a family and to have their children at an earlier stage of their lives, but also, indirectly, that of making the Lisbon objectives compatible with the demographic regeneration of our society. The Member States have a duty to create an appropriate social, economic and educational framework, always keeping in mind the ultimate aim of promoting equal opportunities. For example, the allocation of paternity leave, which is increasingly widespread in northern Europe, is a valid way of attempting to meet the rightful aspirations of young women. Mr President, we all know that the Member States have exclusive responsibility for the sectors of education and the family, but it is for this very reason that, with a view to finding a common denominator among the states of the European Union, I believe that the rapporteur’s proposal to provide for the exchange of best practice within the context of the meetings of Ministers is to be fully supported. For this reason, my parliamentary group is in favour of the report.

The phenomenon of organised crime in Europe, along the lines of the mafia or similar groups, is taking root and spreading rapidly in the ‘Old Continent’. This is a worrying phenomenon where criminals profit from the free movement of persons and economic and financial movements within the European Union in order to expand their own illegal activities more and more, including in countries outside the EU. These activities include arms and waste smuggling (including radioactive waste), drugs trafficking, the sexual exploitation of women and children, trafficking in human tissues (the cases discovered and reported a few days ago in Ukraine are tragic examples of what is currently taking place) and illicit operations involving animals and artworks. The Newton Dunn report points out, among many other things, the role played to date by Europol and Eurojust – the only available Community instruments – in the fight against organised crime, underlining some results that have been achieved but deploring their lack of genuine autonomy. On this point, I would like to advance once again my proposal, which was addressed to the Commission and the Council back in February 2004, to create a European monitoring centre on organised crime with the aim of reducing the discrepancies in the sanctions existing in the various legal systems of the individual Member States, discrepancies that Mr Newton Dunn has taken the timely step of pointing out.

Madam President, Mr Barrot, ladies and gentlemen, I am not saying anything new in stressing that the issue of maritime transport safety in the territorial waters of the European Union is, unfortunately, constantly and sometimes tragically topical. Only three months ago we had the 45th accident in 50 years in the Strait of Messina, which is one of the busiest areas for Mediterranean maritime transport. The accident, which involved a ferry and a hydrofoil, again resulted in deaths and injuries. This tragedy could perhaps have been avoided if the sophisticated terrestrial radar system, which ought to have been controlling maritime traffic, had been fully functioning. Today, all that is monitoring traffic in the Strait of Messina is the AIS – the satellite automatic identification system – which is compulsory for vessels with a tonnage of over 300 tonnes. On this point, the Committee on Fisheries, with the aim of improving the safety of fishermen and their craft – let us remember that many serious maritime accidents are caused by the failure of merchant vessels to see fishing boats – has adopted an amendment in its opinion calling for AIS systems to be mandatory on all new fishing boats. With regard to existing fishing boats, funding should be provided especially for small boats, since the majority of fishing boats operating in the Mediterranean belong to small operators who are already in serious financial difficulties, having had to make huge sacrifices to comply with fisheries policy with the so-called ‘blue boxes’. Madam President, Mr Barrot, having faith in the growth of maritime transport means, therefore, guaranteeing the safety of everyone everywhere, both passengers and crew, in internal and external waters, but it also means increasing monitoring and imposing stiffer penalties on those who break the rules. The vote in this Chamber may therefore constitute hard evidence of Europe’s willingness to move in this direction.

The three main objectives set by the Barcelona Conference of 1995 – namely the creation of a free trade area by 2010 between the European Union and its African and Asian partners; an area of peace and stability and the development of free, democratic societies – have not yet been achieved. The conflict between Palestine and Israel is, unfortunately, light years away from a peaceful resolution. Furthermore, since Israel’s withdrawal from the Gaza Strip a dramatic civil war has broken out between Hamas and Fatah supporters. In some non-European countries in the partnership, although some of the fundamental human rights have been recognised they are often not fully applied. The economic and social partnership too, fed by funds from the Meda Programme, has not produced the hoped-for results, and there is still a dreadful development lag, both because Europe has not taken enough care over the full implementation of the first and second Meda programmes, and also because the beneficiary countries have not always been able to create the economic and social infrastructure necessary to make themselves competitive. Finally, in many Euro-Mediterranean regions, there is no effective transport system, Information Technology is still insufficiently developed and the telecommunications modernisation is still some way off. For these reasons, I think it necessary to postpone the creation of a Euro-Mediterranean free trade area.

The islands of the European Union, whether they are extremely remote or not, almost all have to deal with the same difficulties. These include a lack of infrastructure, higher prices caused by additional transport costs, higher energy costs, emigration and immigration. For these reasons I have on several occasions called on the European Commission to give an opinion on some issues that are vital for the development of islands, and specifically Sicily, my region of origin. I believe, first and foremost, that it is vital to grant all islands special lower rates of taxation, as has been done for other European Union regions. This would make it possible to attract more capital, generating development and employment. With regard to incentives for investment, I have asked the Commission to look at the development of a policy that will encourage, in particular, foreign investment, particularly from outside the European Union, at a zero tax-rate. Finally, with regard to the lack of infrastructure, which constitutes one of the greatest obstacles to socio-economic growth in the islands, I am in full agreement with the call upon the Commission to review its policy regarding failure to grant State aid for infrastructure projects that improve transport connections. On this point, I would like to emphasise the need to build a bridge over the Straits of Messina.

 Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, I must congratulate Mrs Sartori on the quality of her report. I believe that respect for women’s rights should in principle be regarded as a sine qua non
 in assessing whether a candidate country should join the European Union or not. I would say that the Copenhagen criteria ought to refer explicitly to respect for women’s rights. We highlighted it in this House last month, when we were debating the status of women in Turkey. At the dawn of the third millennium, women in Europe still have to fight for the right to literacy, equal pay, access to high-level public positions, participation in politics and physical safety. In that respect, I fully endorse the demand that the Member States should severely punish any doctors who agree to perform painful, humiliating tribal practices, particularly female genital mutilation, just for the sake of financial gain or because of a dangerous and distorted respect for other cultures. As for the traffic in women for use in prostitution that is carried on by criminal organisations, I staunchly support the demand that the Member States that have not yet done so should ratify the protocol supplementing the so-called ‘Palermo Protocol’ on combating the trafficking of immigrants. In that respect, I suggested to the Council and Commission back in 2004 that we should set up a centre to monitor Mafia-like organised crime in the European Union precisely so as to enhance our understanding of the extent and causes of criminal networks in Europe and to propose measures to combat them. It is pointless to hide the fact, Madam President, that trafficking in human beings is among the most profitable of these gangs’ activities. Three years have gone by since then, but on this front Europe has remained at the good intentions stage rather than moving on to take action. I hope that the equality roadmap at least will have better luck.

The Commission proposal on the CMO for wine jeopardises the protection of European wine production. The provision that it makes for the grubbing-up of vines is liable to affect entire areas devoted to this production and also to irremediably damage the growing of indigenous vines which, while not very widespread, nonetheless represent centuries-old history and traditions. The constant increase in wine production and quality in the so-called ‘New World’ countries (South Africa, Australia and South America, where vines are, by contrast, being planted), the increasing presence of these wines on the European market and the fact that worldwide demand for wine is on the increase make the idea of grubbing-up all the more incomprehensible. Europe needs to be able to compete with its competitors on equal terms. With a view to optimising European wine production and wine-making, I have tabled an amendment on behalf of the Union for Europe of the Nations Group that underlines the need to maintain the ban in Europe on using the new wine-making practices for ageing wine (such as the use of oak shavings instead of the traditional period spent in the barrel).

 Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, first of all I must congratulate the rapporteur on the well-structured report that she has presented to us. It is a document that addresses subjects of prime importance and highlights the status of women in Turkey and hence in the European Union. Many people say that the progress made by that country on its journey towards EU accession should be judged first on respect for human rights and then on equal rights for men and women. We agree with that, but I believe that women should gain equal rights in Turkey regardless of any aspiration to join the European Union. This is an issue that lies at the basis of any modern, democratic country, but unfortunately, in this context, the European Union is not particularly well qualified to stand up as a champion of safeguards and rights. The rapporteur specifically points to the extreme scarcity of Turkish women in positions of power, and item 41 suggests that adopting a mandatory quota system would be a short-term remedy. I remain sceptical: if the quota system has proved ineffective for us in the European Union, why should it ever work in Turkey? I have two contrasting reactions to the approach taken in the report: on the one hand, I am pleased to see that there is no reference to cases of torture or of excessive policing during demonstrations, but on the other I am concerned to note that a great many problems like female illiteracy and honour crimes are still worryingly common. I am afraid that the time to put them right is still a long way off, much further off in fact than any optimistic prediction.

 This umpteenth and timely question on the sensitive matter of EU civil protection capacity puts the spotlight on one of the most convoluted and controversial sectors that the Member States have ever had to deal with. As I have said before – I have talked to the Commission on a number of occasions and expressed my views in this House – since the civil protection sector is a matter for the individual Member States, it inevitably comes up against very different laws, types of professional training and practices. For that reason, I have for some time supported the idea of capacity building and strengthening the coordination of the national intervention forces, with the aim of rendering the various national legislations more homogeneous. In my view, such action has to be delegated to a special European Civil Protection Agency, on the model of the US Federal Emergency Management Agency. Recent experience has taught us that, if you look beyond the willingness shown, for example, when the horrific tsunami hit part of the Indian Ocean in 2004, the European Union’s emergency management is, I am sorry to say, utterly inadequate.

Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, the two reports under discussion could not have come at a better time, since they examine the notorious construction of the Baltic pipeline, a project that, in the absence of a serious environmental impact assessment, risks causing an ecological disaster in a sea already suffering, moreover, from a worrying level of pollution. Not only that: the northern and southern shores of the Mediterranean, where fish stocks are becoming ever more scarce, also suffer in some areas from a high level of pollution, caused, among other things, by oil extraction and, above all, by oil refining. I refer, in particular, to the industrial triangle of Syracuse in Sicily, which is the largest petrochemical complex in Europe. In this industrial zone, not only is there an extremely high level of air pollution, causing the tragedy of birth defects and the indefensible death rate due to tumours – over 57% higher, in fact, than the Italian average – but there is also the problem of marine pollution. The consequences are obvious: the poor-quality fish stocks are down to critical levels; fishermen, often small operators, either cover more miles to find better fishing waters, or are forced to give up their traditional livelihoods. As if that were not enough, plans are underway to construct a regasifier in this industrial zone, a project I have condemned several times before this House. The proposal for a Marine Strategy Directive and the appropriate amendments that, in our opinion, improve it, are therefore very welcome, Mr President. Above all, I hope that it will shorten the timescale for achieving the objectives of a healthy ecology and environment. We need to make up for the severe delays that Europe has accumulated in this sector, and, as we all know, political timing does not always coincide with the needs of the environment. From this evening, we can afford to be a little more optimistic.

It is well known that, in Europe, civil protection in relation to natural disasters falls within the competence of the Member States. Unfortunately, in some of these countries, there are worrying delays and a sense of indifference, due to a lack of coordination. It is precisely for this reason that, for years now, I have been proposing the establishment of a European Civil Protection Agency that would have the task of bringing the various national laws in line with each other and that would be responsible not only for preventing and anticipating risks, but also for managing emergencies. Strangely enough, in fact, neither the proposal for a Council regulation establishing a rapid response and preparedness instrument for major emergencies nor the proposal for a Council decision establishing a Community civil protection mechanism take into full and due consideration all of the activities aimed at studying and determining the causes of disasters, at identifying the risks and at singling out the more vulnerable regions subject to such risks – in other words, the ‘anticipation’ of risks – even though they are crucial when it comes to tackling natural disasters effectively. This Agency, created on the model of the US Federal Emergency Management Agency, should not only repair the damage caused by natural disasters, but also, and above all, fund preventative actions aimed at eliminating or reducing the causes of such disasters.

The high number of respiratory diseases and of human lives lost due to a high level of air pollution demonstrates the urgent and pressing need for another Community legislative measure on health protection that will further limit emissions that are harmful to humans. The abnormally high percentages of birth defects in some industrial regions of the European Union are of particular concern. The case of the Sicilian petrochemicals plants is typical: of the 13 000 babies born between 1992 and 2002, almost 1 000 have heart, limb and digestive tract defects, while the mortality rate among males with stomach cancer is 57% higher than the Italian national average. In some urban areas, too, such as in the city of Messina, which absorbs traffic day and night in the form of vehicles leaving Sicily bound for the European continent and vice versa, the situation has become unbearable. The Union for Europe of the Nations Group’s position in favour of the Krahmer report is a further incentive for the fight against air pollution in Europe to be stepped up in the years to come.

 Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, it is sad to realise that only in recent years has the subject of civil protection been aired in this Chamber and it is debated each time in connection with a particular kind of disaster: an earthquake the day before yesterday, marine pollution yesterday, fires and floods today, and so forth. The topics are fragmented, powers are fragmented and resources are fragmented. That alone would be enough to justify the tenacity with which my political group has been proposing for years to this House and the Commission that a European civil protection agency should be set up. This would be a versatile, flexible body endowed with its own powers and with human and material resources supplied by the Member States. It would be able not only to draw up a risk prediction and prevention plan, but also – and more importantly – to direct and coordinate emergency measures with all due speed in the event of a disaster. It is now more important than ever to set up a civil protection agency, Commissioner, after the unfortunate experience of recent years when so-called Community cooperation has proved worthless and ineffective, if not downright harmful. What use is the experience that has been gained by individual Member States in relation to civil protection if Europe is not then in a position to intervene immediately to manage emergencies, reduce damage, provide relief and coordinate volunteers? Finally, we need to believe that, if there is one sector where the principle of territoriality does not hold, it is precisely that of civil protection. Have we learnt nothing from the unfortunate experience of the Prestige
 oil slick or this summer’s forest fires, or the terrible impression that was left when, faced with the tsunami tragedy, Brussels decided to leave the 300 European task force experts at home after having trained and prepared them for years? Then let us put an end to the ambiguity of good intentions, Commissioner, and try to coordinate our interventions, powers and resources firmly and formally, so that Europe can also play a leading role when it is a case of protecting the right to life, which is a physiological right rather than an institutional one.

Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, I realise that the problem of illegal immigration in the Mediterranean, seen from here, Strasbourg or Brussels, in the heart of the European continent, may appear to many to be a marginal issue to be addressed with the cold, formal language of bureaucracy and with the complicity of Community policy, which, at times, can be cynical and hypocritical. Those, like me, however, who live day and night in Sicily, the furthest point of Europe in the Mediterranean, have no difficulty in declaring, within the plush walls of this Chamber, that a true human drama is unrolling before our eyes. Only last year, Commissioner, more than 20 000 illegal immigrants arrived on our Sicilian shores, double the number of those who landed in all the European countries bordering the Mediterranean in the past two years. Each day, hundreds of arrivals undergo the same ordeal, the same stations of the Cross: shipwrecks offshore and then bodies washed up onto the Sicilian beaches by the sea currents. It is a tragedy involving young players and victims, women and children fleeing from their countries, searching for a dream that for none of them will ever come true; first they have to go through the human smuggling racket and then a life of hardship, suffering, privation and exploitation awaits those who manage to avoid the police controls. This tragedy is taking place on European soil and what is Europe’s response? It responds late and ineffectually. Only last December, the European Council in Brussels proposed a series of generic actions to be taken in 2006 and invited the Commission to coordinate their implementation. But it is said that resources are limited and additional funds will not be available until 2007. Too little, Commissioner: we need decisive action and your statements this evening have given us the right to hope. You are known to be a person who is in favour of decisive, practical action and we invite you to give us yet another further demonstration of it.

 Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I should like to congratulate the rapporteur on the clarity and thoroughness of the report he has presented. We have been highlighting the need for the sustainable exploitation of fisheries, particularly in the Mediterranean, for a long time, repeating what has been confirmed with due emphasis in the report we are debating today. Unfortunately, the short time I have available will not allow me to examine in any depth some interesting points such as gender equality in the fisheries sector, safety on board fishing boats, alternative energy sources in view of high diesel prices, and modernisation of the fleet. I am pleased to point out that inshore and traditional fishing – and I say this as a man from the south of Italy, who lives in close contact with the seafaring world on almost a daily basis – not only represents an extremely important source of income for thousands of European families living around our continent’s coasts, but also brings with it a centuries-old tradition that Europe must, in my view, support and preserve. Supporting inshore fishing means, inter alia
, protecting it from unregulated fishing by vessels flying the flags of third countries that brazenly carry on their activities subject to no controls and without any regard for the quantity, quality or species of the fish they catch. Southern Italy’s fishing community has recently protested about this for the umpteenth time, this time in Bagnara in Calabria. The European Union should not force our fishermen to accept restrictions and sacrifices while leaving non-EU fleets in the Mediterranean completely free to do as they like. The inshore fisheries sector can and must make this important economic activity compatible with preservation of the marine environment, which is both necessary and incumbent upon us. On these and other grounds I fully support this report. I must particularly stress paragraph 16 of the motion for a resolution, which calls on the Commission to recognise once and for all the specific nature of inshore and traditional fishing in the common fisheries policy, since it has been poorly treated so far.

 Mr President, during the debate on the sustainable exploitation of Mediterranean fishery resources, I said that the compromise reached by Parliament and the Commission may not have filled us with too much enthusiasm, but that it was undoubtedly an improvement over the initial proposal. This is not the right moment to bring up the pros and cons of the compromise; let us just say that I regard it – at least, that is my hope – as a step on the way to the rational management of Mediterranean fishery resources, combined with essential support to improve the precarious level of employment in the fishing industry, which involves thousands of families spread around the shores of Mare nostrum
. The die is cast. We cannot turn back. I therefore hope that the Council, in making its decisions, does not seek inspiration in the young Saint Augustine’s prayers to the Almighty, as recalled in his ‘Confessions’: ‘Lord, give me chastity, but not yet!’ We can certainly wait a few more months for the regulation to be adopted, but please do not take too long: our fishermen are full of expectation.

 The sexual exploitation of women and children is a scourge of humankind that is becoming an ever-greater problem as time goes on. I fully agree with the idea of providing for severe punishment for the clients of sex slaves. That is not enough, however. A common, effective strategy is also needed. Trafficking in human beings, which is controlled by a real Mafia-like multinational of organised crime, feeds on the desperation and poverty of men and women who flee their own countries of origin in search of jobs and a better life in the rich countries of the world. Although trafficking in women and children is mainly directed towards sexual exploitation, it is also, unfortunately, used for other purposes that are equally despicable and degrading for a human being: forced labour, slavery and – something I find even more ignominious – the export of organs. Sexual exploitation is known to be part of a larger complex of criminal activity that includes sex tourism, drug trafficking and the smuggling of arms and radioactive waste. In order to help fight the Mafia and similar criminal networks, I again propose – as I did in March 2004 – that a European observatory should be set up to monitor organised crime and to propose ways of harmonising the laws on punishing it across the European Union.

 Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, we have always looked with great interest on Turkey’s bold decision to align itself with the West, at least at the level of military and strategic choices. In particular, those like me who live on the most southerly patch of European soil, in the heart of the Euro-Afro-Asian basin, are aware more than anyone else of the need to establish borders and boundaries in a spirit of peaceful coexistence. The democratisation process that the Turkish Government has launched with a view to possibly joining the European Union still seems slow, uncertain and contradictory. Some obstacles have undoubtedly been overcome, but others have yet to be removed. It is not a case of the West subjecting Turkey to a long, never-ending examination, but it is essential to base enlargement on foundations of democracy and respect for civil and international rights. The European Union therefore has a duty to support Turkey on its westward journey of preparation, but it also has a duty to be inflexible and intransigent in this field. It would be totally unjustifiable to make any other decision for the sake of opportunism, so for now that justifies our considered abstention today.

 I should like to congratulate Mr Queiró on his excellent report. I shall confine myself to some brief thoughts. For years now we have all been aware of the important part played by tourism in developing local economies and creating jobs, especially for women and young people. The European Conference on Tourism and Employment, organised by the Luxembourg Presidency in November 1997, showed ‘the pulling power that tourism exercises on young people and women, to whom it often offers a first job opportunity’. For that reason as well, we in the Union for Europe of the Nations Group fully support the call for the Commission and the Council, when adopting the structural policy instruments for 2007-2013, to provide for an integrated approach to tourism, ‘allowing the European Agricultural Fund for Rural Development and the European Regional Development Fund actions to be coordinated’. A further aspect that I must underline, which is something totally new, is the reference to itinerant tourism, represented particularly by camper vans and caravans. This is effectively a segment of the tourist industry that is active 365 days a year and contributes to employment growth in the sector. In lean times, that is no bad thing! This segment therefore needs measures to encourage its development.

Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, after long and arduous negotiations, begun not much less than two years ago, we have reached a compromise that only partially satisfies our Group. We are delighted, for example, to see resurrected potential financial support for the biological standstill, even if the new European Fisheries Fund is not considering it. Important matters remain on the table, however, which, in our opinion, are at odds with the interests of fishing in the Mediterranean. A further example: we believe that, given the importance of the whitebait sector, that species can be put on sale on condition that it is caught with statutory gear. That is why we have tabled Amendment 27, which we hope will be adopted. We have stressed the specific character of Mediterranean fishing a number of times: it is essentially coastal and small scale, a type of fishing that is part of culture and which, in addition to passing down a centuries-old tradition from generation to generation, constitutes a vital source for the economy, particularly in an area – let us not forget – of extensive socioeconomic degradation. We therefore believe that points 3 and 4 of Annex 2 must be taken out, the intention of which is to regulate and standardise the technical features of small-scale gear, which, precisely because it is linked to a specific type of fishing and to specific coastal zones, cannot by its very nature be the subject of regulatory enforcement. We congratulate the rapporteur, Mrs Fraga Estévez, and harbour the legitimate hope that this regulation may be a significant breakthrough towards a Mediterranean that is careful to preserve its fish fauna, but is also the source of livelihoods and employment for thousands of European fishermen, who, up to now, have only been required to observe bans and limits, whilst for the non-European fleets the Mediterranean has been a kind of free zone.

 Mr President, Mrs Ferrero-Waldner, ladies and gentlemen, ten years after the Barcelona Declaration, there is still a long way to go before the objectives laid down by that Conference are achieved in the Mediterranean. This is a bitter pill to swallow, but we have to face the facts pragmatically and without hypocrisy. The social, economic, cultural and human partnership between the two sides of the Mediterranean is proceeding on a foundation of uncertainty and contradictions. The Barcelona Process has moved forward slowly, in particular with regard to the implementation of the MEDA programme, whose pace has quickened only in recent years. The European Union has been incapable of playing a significant, decisive role in the Israeli-Palestinian conflict. The outrageous trafficking in illegal immigrants between the two sides of the Mediterranean is a continuing sign of the failure of the cooperation policy that was hoped for between the countries of departure and the countries of arrival. We wish to remain optimistic, however, and we welcome the positive signals coming from that area. The changed behaviour of the Libyan Government towards international terrorism, the recent breakthrough in relations between Israel and Palestine and the establishment of the Euro-Mediterranean Parliamentary Assembly all give us reason to hope. The European Union needs, at last, to take on a more powerful political role in order to bring about a genuine climate of cooperation, growth and peace in the area. Otherwise, this tenth anniversary of the Barcelona Conference, this 2005 dedicated to the Mediterranean, is likely to be seen just as a year marked by our weakness.

 Mr President, the key lesson to be learnt from the Indian Ocean disaster is the crucial and urgent need to equip the European Union with civil protection. The events of recent days should make us give the matter serious consideration: Europe with its 25 Member States, its almost half a billion people and its single currency just looked on, stunned, dismayed and impotent, while the peoples that had been affected called out for immediate, practical and effective aid. Where was the European civil protection mentioned in the action plan drawn up in 1999? What did the European Monitoring Centre achieve? Where was the civil protection task force set up by the Council of the European Union in October 2001 precisely to guarantee rapid intervention even outside Europe? Why did the Commission decide to leave the 300 experts in the European task force at home during the tsunami disaster after training and preparing them for years? Perhaps now is not the time for polemics, but it should at least be put on record – as we have been demanding for the last three years – that what Europe needs is not coordination and pooling of resources, but a civil protection agency, an autonomous body that is versatile and thus able to anticipate needs and take action when and where it is required. That is what Parliament should be proposing, starting with tomorrow’s resolution, if we do not want to carry on pretending that nothing has happened or thinking that solidarity is just an empty promise.

 Turkey’s possible accession to the European Union brings with it many benefits and a few risks. The benefits are more political than economic since, as well as being a member of NATO, Turkey has signed a customs union treaty with the European Union that already permits free trade. Its accession would not only fulfil the dream of millions of citizens of fully belonging to the secular western world, but it would shift the centre of gravity of political and economic influence towards the Mediterranean basin, confirming Europe as a world power no longer closed in within its geopolitical boundaries. On the other hand, the risks that should be taken into consideration are, first, the reduced likelihood of seeing the birth of a Europe with its own common foreign policy, as well as the possible difficulty of making two diverse religious and cultural identities coexist. Can it describe itself yet as a democratic state that respects its ethnic minorities? Secondly, it would have a negative effect on the allocation of European funds to regions currently considered to be ‘lagging behind in their development’, such as Sicily, at least in the short term. Lastly, Turkey should withdraw from that part of Cyprus under military occupation, and it goes without saying that it must declare its willingness to square its account with history by acknowledging the errors it has made over the last hundred years ...

 Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, I shall say straight away that I am in favour of extending the Community action programme on civil protection by two years. To me it seems not so much a free choice as a mandatory solution, without any alternatives. We have reached the end of the current programme without a lasting, concrete solution to the problem. That very fact shows just how marginal the subject of civil protection in Europe is. I feel I have developed some modest experience in this field, as I chair the civil protection committee in Catania, the province of Italy most exposed to seismic and volcanic risk, and also because I coordinated the emergency measures for the Italian Government during the terrible eruption of Mount Etna in the summer of 2001. Over the years I have come to the conclusion that civil protection is not just an agreeable topic for a round table or a pleasant, convivial get-together, but is a subject that is indissolubly linked to people’s safety and, as you know, safety is a physiological right before it is a constitutional right. I believe I can say that the European Union is seriously and scandalously dragging its feet in this area. The subject was first addressed only five years ago with a number of initiatives that appear good in theory but in practice suffer from serious deficiencies – as was pointed out by the rapporteur himself, whose work I admire. In fact, the approach seems schizophrenic not only at a logistical level but also because of the inadequate financial cover. Commissioner, what results have the information monitoring centre, the solidarity fund and the Community mechanism achieved in terms of risk forecasting and prevention, rather than of emergency and post-emergency management? What qualitative results have they had on European Union territory? Can we find out what their effect has been? Can we have a detailed report? Will people understand that a disaster may not always coincide with the borders of an individual state, thus becoming a supranational problem, as the oil slick from the Prestige
 demonstrated? How can civil protection capabilities in Europe be allowed to remain fragmented among the areas of responsibility of the environment, health, territory, agriculture and internal affairs? A European civil protection agency needs to be set up, something I asked the Commission to do two years ago. Apart from the fact that an operational structure can undoubtedly increase involvement, especially in Member States that are less sensitive to the problem, such a solution would have the advantage of operating above the territorial level to develop and harmonise procedures and methods for analysing and mitigating the risk of natural and technological disasters, and it would establish a proper task force. In conclusion, I believe we need to promote the action of civil protection volunteers and to support it with structured training, equipment and funds, so that it can become an essential resource for dealing with emergencies and natural and other disasters. I hope that the Commission will find the strength, the will and the courage to work with Parliament in this area.

Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, our primary aim is to ensure that Europe has a common agricultural policy after 2013. We believe that this is a fundamental point, not only in order to protect the agricultural sector and the socio-economic fabric in our Member States, but also because at the dawn of the third millennium it is more strategically vital than ever to guarantee Europe’s food security. Commissioner, we would like to stress the fact that we need to continue to implement policies of support for each individual common organisation of agricultural markets (CMOs), where necessary, and specifically we believe that: a) In the tobacco sector the decoupling of aid must provide for the option to maintain partially coupled aid up until 2013, in order to avoid the total abandonment of production, because that would jeopardise entire sectors, creating unemployment and also various economic and environmental problems in particularly disadvantaged areas. I would like to remind the Commissioner and the President that the European Parliament has already expressed its support, by a large majority, on this issue. b) In the milk sector, in order to rebalance the market in the short term and to make it possible to exit with a soft landing from the quota system in the long term, it would be advisable to increase quotas by 2% in every marketing year during the 2009-2010 and 2014-2015 periods.

Madam President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, the aim of the Commission proposal is basically to continue deducting 5% of the tobacco aid granted for the calendar years 2008 and 2009 and to use those funds to continue financing the Community Tobacco Fund, whose sole purpose is to finance information initiatives for improving European citizens’ awareness of the harmful effects of tobacco consumption. First of all, I think it would be appropriate to highlight a few objective terms of reference. The transfer of CAP aid to the Fund is a rare and positive example of integration and cooperation between the agriculture and health policies of the European Union. Since the activities of the Fund are important for the citizens of the Union, and will continue to be important in the future, as the Commission has underlined, we consider that its continued financial support is necessary for 2007 and for 2009. The deduction from coupled aid granted to farmers has always been the sole source of financing of the Community Tobacco Fund. The financial basis of this deduction was substantially reduced with the reform of the tobacco CMO and by the decision of some Member States to opt for complete decoupling, thereby completely depriving the Fund of the income from those deductions. It is necessary, by further extending the period of application of the deduction and by increasing its percentage rate, to make sufficient resources available from the Fund to finance programmes without impacting further on the EU budget, at least until the end of the current forecasts, while at the same time seeking other ways of financing the Fund. One of the positive aspects of the Fund’s financing mechanism is the provision for at least 25% of the total amount of approved projects to be co-financed by proven operators, thus guaranteeing the availability of increased funding. The Committee on Agriculture has frequently considered these questions and maintains its own line, which is to tighten restrictions on smoking and to improve people’s awareness of its harmful effect on human health. On the other hand, we are fully aware, as stated in Parliament’s legislative resolution of 10 March 2004, that European raw tobacco production, which is now low and concentrated in a few, specific areas of the Union, accounts for less than 4% of world production and has no impact on local consumption of tobacco products. Although this topic is not central to today’s debate, it is worth remembering that the European Union is the world’s leading importer of raw tobacco and relies for over 70% of its requirements on third countries – principally Brazil, Malawi, Argentina, Indonesia, Zimbabwe, India and China – to the advantage of tobaccos often produced under less closely regulated conditions than European tobacco. This also results in a trade deficit of over EUR 1.2 billion per annum. On the other hand, Member States where tobacco aid has been completely decoupled have seen, besides the cancellation of transfers to the Fund, the total abandonment of production, without any sustainable alternative in economic or employment terms. This has had very serious adverse effects on the rural areas concerned as a whole and has not led to any change in the local consumption of finished tobacco products. As regards the proposal to make a deduction in the aid for the calendar year 2008, and bearing in mind that the tobacco cultivation contracts for the 2008 harvest year were concluded some time ago, the Committee on Agriculture considers that approving that proposal could give rise to a whole series of legal actions or, at any event, to a dispute which would ultimately cause serious harm to farmers alone. Finally, the Committee on Agriculture considers that, by extending the deduction until the harvest year 2012 and increasing the percentage rate of the deduction for the Fund to 6%, there would be enough money to cover actions under the Community Tobacco Fund until the year 2013, and it calls on the Commission to prepare a multiannual programme which, suitably altered in accordance with the amendments proposed here, could draw on EUR 81 million without impacting further on the Union’s budget.

 Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I would like to thank the Commissioner and all those Members who have spoken. I would point out that, as far as the future of the European tobacco sector is concerned, a formal request was made recently to the Commission, signed by the Ministers of almost all the tobacco-producing Member States, including those countries which have opted for complete decoupling, and the new Member States, for the Commission to put forward a proposal for a regulation extending the current system of support for tobacco production until the year 2013. That matter must be addressed as part of the discussions currently in progress on the CAP ‘health check’. I will conclude, Mr President, by inviting my fellow Members – who at first glance might appear to be less interested in a measure which only involves a deduction from aid to growers in five old Member States, which have maintained the aid partly coupled – to reflect on the fact that the use of those resources and the Fund’s information initiatives will continue to be aimed at benefiting the health of all citizens of the Union. I would also like to point out that perhaps there is a fundamental misconception here: this report is not concerned with and takes no decision on prolonging aid payments to tobacco producers; it is merely a question of voting on a report which advocates prolonging the financing of the Community Tobacco Fund. As regards prolonging the aid payments, that is a decision to be taken later, but that is not the subject of this report which, as I said, is about prolonging the financing of the Community Tobacco Fund and not about prolonging aid payments to tobacco producers in the immediate and foreseeable future.

 Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, we are among those who believe in and defend the continuation of the CAP even after 2012. We feel that this report is a step in the right direction, but we cannot accept that the full decoupling of aid should not allow for the possibility of maintaining a partial coupling of aid for some specific sectors, to prevent the complete abandonment of production. There are, in fact, whole sectors, such as the tobacco sector, that would disappear with the application of full decoupling, creating unemployment and various economic and environmental problems in particularly disadvantaged areas. We consider the progressive modulation of aid rather an excessive and probably counterproductive measure if the objective is still to safeguard European agricultural production. We recognise the importance of rural development, but we feel this cannot be achieved at the expense of the first pillar of the CAP. Furthermore, it is necessary to continue to implement policies to support individual common organisations of the markets where this is necessary.

 Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, the text on which we are about to vote constitutes a good compromise and considerably improves the Commission's initial proposal. Our aim is still to launch a reform geared to revitalising the sector on both the domestic and international markets. Global demand is not falling, but rising, so the right approach is not to produce less but to invest in the quality and character of European wines, in cutting costs, in promoting wine so as to expand the market and in helping young people to establish vineyards. It is equally necessary to limit the reduction in European wine production, as proposed by the Commission, by increasing the Member States' autonomy to govern the grubbing-up scheme. We must avoid destroying vineyards which, while perhaps not having a particularly strong market position, produce high-quality regional wines, have well-established historical traditions and even today make up the social fabric of entire regional areas. Despite creating the conditions for greater competitiveness, this reform must retain links with the past and promote the continuation of wine-growing as a factor in preserving the land and the environment. We are therefore in favour of allocating the earmarked resources over three years rather than five and distributing them primarily on the basis of historical data, broadly according to the same criterion used for all other reforms adopted until now. Commissioner, we are opposed to the liberalisation of new oenological practices and the use of imported must to enrich our wines or blend them with third country wines, because we believe that this could be detrimental to the wine's image and could compromise the consumer's trust in the product, with extremely serious consequences for consumption. On the other hand, we think it is vital to provide aid for concentrated musts and rectified concentrated musts used for enrichment purposes, so as to protect an oenological practice common in many Community regions. We believe that investment by producers must be borne in mind and that any disruptions to trade flows which could increase available supplies must be avoided. This reform must encourage the protection of geographical indications and designations of origin, as a means of better guaranteeing and protecting European wines in the context of multilateral negotiations and bilateral trade agreements. Finally, Commissioner, we are against the full liberalisation of planting rights from 2014 onwards for wines with designations of origin and geographical indications, and we can endorse the rapporteur's proposal that the new reform should enter into force on 1 August 2009.

Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, throughout Europe we are seeing across-the-board increases in the price of foodstuffs. Market surveys carried out show how European consumers are radically changing their eating habits, being forced to change the quality and type of products that they buy as a result of the exorbitant prices. These increases can be blamed on the one hand on the excessive number of intermediate phases that products must go through from the producer to the consumer, and on the other on the disproportionate increases applied by major supermarket chains. One thing is certain however: the blame for these increases cannot and must not be placed on our farmers, who are the main victims of this worrying situation. Mr President and Commissioner, we believe that today more than ever, the European agricultural model must be protected in order to shield national agricultural markets from international price fluctuations and give substance to the defence of models of production and use of the territory which are so characteristic of European agriculture. We welcome the Council’s recent decision to ratify the proposal for zero set-aside for 2008. However, this does not do enough to reassure us about the worrying situation in terms of cereal stocks and the rising price of cereals on the world market. We also need to work with the various CMOs and make good use of these mechanisms for rebalancing the market, which would help ease food prices, at least in the internal market. We asked the Commission, in a recent question, to propose an immediate increase in milk quotas of at least 2-3% to help stabilise the price of this staple product. In a difficult economic climate such as this one, the European Union and the Member States have a responsibility to help consumers maintain their food purchasing power while at the same time protecting our farmers’ right to an income.

Madam President, Mrs Fischer Boel, ladies and gentlemen, above and beyond its role as an agricultural and economic product, wine represents our history, culture and traditions. Thus, we cannot accept a reform primarily aimed at resizing a sector that currently uses only 3% of budget funds, as compared with added-value production of 7%. The Commission is proposing to reduce production and to grub up approximately 400 000 hectares of vines over five years, on the grounds of the need to reduce management costs on production surpluses and to improve European competitiveness through the principle that ‘only the strongest will remain on the market’. It is strange to observe that, while Europe favours a policy of grubbing up vines, other countries, such as those in South America and southern Africa, support planting them. In view of the fact that worldwide demand is not falling but increasing, it seems that the Commission intends to restore a balance in the European Union’s internal market without taking into consideration worldwide demand and the balance of the world market, and without considering that in the hasty reduction of European wine production there is a risk of eliminating some vines which, while not producing products that are extremely strong on the market, are regional holdings of quality, with strongly-rooted historical traditions that still today act as the social fabric for entire regional areas. The truth is that the new world wines are gaining market share thanks to a growing improvement in product quality, together with the competitiveness of their prices. The new intervention methods ought to make it possible for the whole sector to meet the new challenges imposed by an increasingly globalised market. The winning formula is still to invest in the quality and individual characteristics of European wines, in cost reduction, in the promotion of wine in order to enlarge its market, and we fear that the spread of new oenological practices may lead to a deterioration in the image of wine and therefore compromise the relationship of trust between the consumer and the product, with very serious consequences for consumption. Mrs Fischer Boel, the wine sector needs a reform that promotes greater competitiveness in European wine, by continuing with the restructuring of vines to make them more competitive and by promoting the maintenance of viticulture to act as protection for the land and the environment. Geographical labels and designations of origin should be understood to be vital tools in guaranteeing and protecting European producers. To conclude, Mrs Fischer Boel, what we ask of a new EU wine policy is the recovery and development of the sector on the world market.

 Madam President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, we have always maintained, both in committee and in Parliament, that the Commission’s haste in pushing through its proposal – to the extent of breaking institutional and Community rules – was suspicious to say the least. The reason for such haste seemed obvious: after the World Trade Organisation negotiations, the Commissioner would certainly find it more difficult to gain approval for a reform characterised above all by major price cuts and partial compensation for losses. Madam President, while agreeing that reform is needed, my group has always demanded that it should not only bring in the necessary changes, but above all not lose sight of the essential aim of keeping the sector internationally competitive in the medium and long term. We have therefore been opposed to the Commission’s proposal right from the start, because it aims at concentrating production in certain Member States by sacrificing the less suitable, weaker areas; thus only some areas will have to pay the price of the inevitable overall cut in European production. Fortunately, the Council has mitigated the Commission’s original proposal, partly by introducing the chance for Member States to grant production-linked aid, up to a maximum of 30%, although the compromise achieved is not fully satisfactory and will still penalise the sector too much. At this stage Parliament must, in any case, accept the responsibilities conferred on it by the Treaties and adopt its own position. Although it will be very difficult to reopen a debate that is now closed, when the Council comes to formally approve the reform, it must consider the possibility of including some of the vital amendments proposed by Parliament to improve the text. These include, for instance, maintaining the intervention system until 2010; varying compensatory aid according to production; making it mandatory to allocate at least 50% of the restructuring aid to sugar beet and chicory growers, to offset their loss of income; and reformulating the conditions for access to the restructuring system through the signing of a trade agreement with the sugar beet and chicory growers.

That is a scandalous rise, because it is prohibitive for most of the families involved and because it was decided while the 1994 agreement, which covered a 10-year period, was still in force. Because European Schools provide a public service, such unilateral decisions violating families’ established rights should not be allowed. Whatever compromises may be possible on budgetary matters, we feel we must stand fast on a number of points: 1) European Schools should exist in all Member States; 2) there should be as many language sections as possible, according to the principle of respecting cultural identity; 3) the maximum class size should be reduced from the current 32; 4) it would be worth making a few adjustments to the curricula: art history, for instance, is currently excluded, although it would encourage a greater understanding of the common cultural values that have inspired the peoples of Europe over the centuries; 5) a vocational baccalaureate should be added alongside the current arts- and science-based European baccalaureate: both courses would remain a specific, valid point of reference for providing young people with a European training.

Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, there is undoubtedly a need for reform of the regime governing Type C Sugar, partly in view of the latest developments at the WTO, but we believe this should be included within the key points of the overall CAP reform. That means making the necessary changes, while not losing sight of the essential aim of keeping the sector internationally competitive over the medium and long term. Instead of this, we have the impression that the European Commission, in complying with the constraints of production cut-backs imposed by international treaties and free trade agreements, is intending to sacrifice certain producing areas, which are frequently the weakest. That will be facilitated by the Commission’s planned mechanism for the purchase of quotas by one Member State from another. On a European level, the closure and abandonment of many sugar plants and the move away from sugar beet production by many agricultural enterprises all confirm that competitive pressure is constantly on the increase as a result of the reduction, in real terms, of the guaranteed price for volumes produced. To conclude, the measures proposed by the European Commission should certainly be viewed as unacceptable, since the excessive reduction in the benchmark intervention price, the major fall in sugar beet prices, the partial 60% compensation and the introduction of private storage put the survival of the sugar beet sector at great risk. In our view, the future proposed law should instead be based upon quotas and guaranteed prices, linked to real national production quotas. It should also protect the European single market, by introducing import restrictions; it should introduce more effective customs rules for checking the origins of products, reduce quotas to a level which would suffice for internal consumption and introduce or maintain measures to reduce the structural disparities – for instance, authorisation for state aid in order to protect the interests of farmers living in the Union's under-privileged areas, guaranteeing the continuation of a multifunctional agriculture throughout the European region.

Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, the crisis which we are discussing is like a tsunami: severe and devastating. So far, it has caused the collapse of the financial markets and undermined the foundations of the real economy. The provision of a total of EUR 200 billion, finalised at the EU summits, seems, in my humble opinion, to be completely inadequate. This figure amounts to less than the sums lost by Europe’s stock markets in a single of those many days when they closed with a sharp deficit. We need to be bolder, more courageous, more European. I am in favour, with my group’s consent, and President Barroso has already been directly authorised to do this, of Member States relying on their own reserves, holding in return a European bond to be traded on the markets. They will be obliged however to invest the same amount in infrastructures and in policies for supporting those experiencing social hardship and the production system. These bonds, which will be pegged to the value of the states’ reserves, should generate confidence and help to acquire the required level of liquidity – 2-5 percentage points of GDP – to be able to pursue the policies which we all agree are needed. All of this is carried out outside the Maastricht Treaty, along with an appropriate recovery plan.

 Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I should like to mention that the right to the sanctity of life and to human dignity – which is upheld in the loftier part of the Fava report – is an absolute value in which we all believe and for which we are prepared to fight. Mr Fava goes further, however, and becomes a one-sided inquisitor: he grants this right to terrorists but not to the secret agents incriminated and arrested in Milan by a judge who has denied the head of the Italian secret service, General Pollari, the right to a defence, since he has rejected his request to call the previous Head of Government, Silvio Berlusconi, and the present incumbent, Romano Prodi, as witnesses. Mr Fava criticises, condemns and deplores all the governments of Europe, in addition to the US Administration. It does not matter to Mr Fava that an undercover intelligence operation and the squeezing of a terrorist’s right to human dignity may have prevented a repetition of the Twin Towers tragedy. The report criticises, deplores and condemns all the governments of Europe, whether on the right or on the left, as well as the Council of Europe itself, as being guilty of colluding with and submitting to the hated enemy George W. Bush. Can it be that only Mr Fava is right and that the judges of just three countries – Italy, Spain and Germany – are the heroes of this report? Yet the centre-left Italian Government under Romano Prodi has challenged the documents – the ones produced by the Public Prosecutor’s Office in Milan – before the Constitutional Court in order to protect State secrets. For Mr Fava, only terrorists have the right to a defence. General Pollari, the head of the Italian secret service, should not defend himself: he is guilty. He cannot reveal, however, that Abu Omar, a suspected CIA agent, was picked up to save him from certain death, so much so that he was not taken to Guantánamo but sent back to his own country, and he is now at liberty. Abu Omar is a CIA spy. General Pollari is right, but it does not matter. Human rights law has been violated and that cannot be tolerated, not even if it was done to save human lives and ensure the security of the Member States. A great mentor of mine, the jurist Salvatore Pugliatti, used to say that laws are female and can be violated, whereas the Law is male and cannot. We are on the side of the Law, and not of laws.

 Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I am making this proposal on behalf of my group and under Rule 155(6) of the Rules of Procedure: I propose a block vote on 122 amendments that are complementary to each other, in order to simplify procedure. In any case, these amendments are workable in relation to those that I propose should be put to the vote individually. Each of these in fact makes its own main point: from violation of State secrecy, to the security of European citizens and States, to the faked kidnapping of Abu Omar, a CIA spy, who was picked up to save him from certain death and not deported to Guantánamo, but sent back to his own country, where he lives under suitable protection and gives interviews. The amendments to be put to the vote separately are therefore the following: 71, 73, 113, 114, 115, 121, 122, 124, 210, 212, 213, 214 and 216. I also propose individual votes, amendment by amendment, from 38 to 69 and from 245 to 256. All the other 122 amendments can be put to the vote as a block.

 Mr President, Commissioner, Minister, ladies and gentlemen, the People programme has found its way to this House after a year of dialogue, in-depth analysis and comparisons. My professional and political experience has brought ideas that are largely shared. They have been instilled into the programme and also incorporated in part into the body of the main legal instrument of Framework Programme 7. I accordingly express my profound thanks to Mr Buzek. The modern world moves at a very fast pace. The twentieth century was turbulent and exciting: it spanned three epochs, from peasant society to the industrial and post-industrial era, and went even further in its final decade. It was then that EU Heads of State or Government drew up their far-sighted recipe for the future. Lisbon 2000 was a ten-year programme, this being the time envisaged for the construction in Europe of a society of knowledge based on research and innovation. Today we must however take note that progress has been slow, although Framework Programme 6 has signalled a significant positive shift in European policy in this particular strategic sector. It is a modest effort when compared with the colossal achievements of the emerging economies: in the past fifteen years investments in the research and development sector in China have risen from USD 12.4 to USD 84.6 billion, an increase of 580%. Today China accounts for 12.5% of world trade and is the second largest world producer of advanced technological goods. Then we have India and the countries of the Indo-Pacific basin, the third axis of the technical and scientific world; this axis accounts for 36% of the high-tech products of the whole world, which is exactly double what the whole of Europe produces. Some analysts have reached a catastrophic conclusion, if this state of affairs is to continue: within twenty years, 90% of the world’s scientists will live in an East Asian country. Thus Europe is lagging behind, when compared to the huge amount – in some cases more than 10% of GDP – that is invested in research and development by those countries. Europe is the prisoner of the selfishness of Member States, some of which even today invest less than 1%, while the average for Europe is less than 2% of GDP. This, very briefly, is the overall picture while we are getting ready to launch Framework Programme 7 – for which the European Commission has rightly asked Member States to provide a more substantial financial input. The People programme constitutes both the mind and the body of the entire legislative corpus: mens sana in corpore sano
. Hence the idea of motivating researchers so as to motivate research. Framework Programme 7 will create the free, independent and motivated European researcher. This is the direction in which we should be moving: from recognising the research profession to giving it legal status; from a code of practice to the creation of a data-bank for selecting and employing researchers; from aligning remuneration with the best international standards; from equal opportunities for men and women, through measures to protect female researchers, to reconciling the needs of the workplace with family life; from initiatives to support family mobility to the necessary social security and insurance provisions, harmonisation of tax regimes, recognition of professional titles across EU states, freedom of movement and independence. These are the prerequisites for creating a European area of research and professional integration, given that after years of investment in training young researchers it is in our own interest to make the most of them. To abandon them would be to give a gift to the United States or China. The positive experience of Marie Curie Actions has appropriately been revisited and will continue, breathing life into a project that aims for excellence in the form of added value: it will have an impact on the organisation of the European research area. We also envisage collaboration and equal opportunities between the public and private sectors. Last but not least, intellectual property, towards which the Council has behaved a little like Pilate with Jesus of Nazareth: it has taken up the idea and turned it into a general rule. No, that is not how things should be done. If we truly wish to motivate researchers, we must give them a cast-iron guarantee that their rights over the intellectual property that they have created will be protected. This is possible – I shall insist on it when I make the request to the Commission and the Council – through contractual clauses under civil law that would protect the results obtained by research and by the individual researcher. To achieve excellence it is necessary to motivate people; and to attract researchers from all parts of the world it is necessary to offer attractive conditions. To combine quantity and quality and produce excellence in basic and technological research, as the People programme and the Framework Programme 7 intend to do, it is necessary to join up all the links and address all outstanding problems, to protect industry and private investments by stimulating them without extinguishing that driving force: the human being that is and remains the heart and mind of research. I thank you all for your kind attention, ladies and gentlemen and shadow rapporteurs – particularly Mr Chichester and my colleagues on the Committee on Industry, Research and Energy, who, by voting unanimously for my report, were sending out a strong signal to the Commission and the Council rather than acknowledging my modest contribution.

 Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, as shadow rapporteur for the seventh framework programme and rapporteur for the ‘People’ specific programme, it is my duty first of all to thank Mr Buzek and all the Members with whom we undertook this difficult work in the knowledge that it had to be done quickly and well, even without any prospect of agreement on the financial perspective. I should also like to thank my colleagues in the Committee on Industry, Research and Energy, and its chairman, Mr Chichester, who timetabled the work wisely and with foresight in such a way that the delay by the Council would not harm the outcome. Last but not least, I have to thank the staff and assistants who surpassed themselves in the long, tiring job of preparing the work and in researching and analysing the points that might lead – as in fact they did – to significant and honourable compromises. Having said that, and before I address some significant points in the framework programme and particularly in the ‘People’ specific programme, I should like to focus on the philosophy of the legislative structure and on the political aspect. The philosophy was to create a European research area that was autonomous and at the same time able to attract new talent and to prevent talent born and bred in Europe from emigrating. The philosophy was also to involve industries and SMEs and to broaden the horizons for research funding and innovative technologies. The objective was achieved in terms of structure, but not at all in terms of resources. The political aspect is linked in practice to the financial aspect, and both are linked to the much abused and hackneyed Lisbon Strategy. At Lisbon, Europe set itself the target of becoming a world leader again by 2010. A rational, pessimistic view is that this target cannot be reached, since other experienced and powerful players are operating on the world stage, with a wealth of means and resources that make our efforts fade into insignificance. In terms of financial resources, our efforts have not been and are still not equal to the task. In that respect it has to be recognised that the Member States have been short-sighted, as they have sacrificed our general interests to the interests of their own national budgets. Nevertheless, while we may have regrets about what might have been done better or about what else could have been done, it is only fair to acknowledge the fact, with hopeful optimism, that much significant progress has been made. I refer to the creation of the European research area, the fact that implementation of the European Charter for Researchers is mandatory for the Member States, the inclusion of small and medium-sized enterprises among those that can compete for and benefit from research projects – in that respect Amendment 334 is significant; it has been signed by several groups and I recommend that it be approved – the introduction of funding for research into renewable and alternative energies, the funding of projects for the preservation of our cultural heritage, and funding through a specific programme for original ideas. As for the ‘People’ specific programme, thanks to a shrewd synergy between the Commission’s competent directorate-general and the shadow rapporteurs, the researcher has become a recognised figure with his or her own dignity and principal attributes; research has become a genuine profession and, as such, it enjoys protection and safeguards. Researchers and women researchers, whose right to have children and a family is recognised, without it being a further hindrance to their careers, are the most important element in research. No researchers means no research, few researchers means little research, and many researchers means a great deal of research. The presence of researchers with economic protection and social assistance, who are mobile and have their own charter implemented at last by all the Member States, means a wealth of talent for Europe and consequently a leading position in the field of innovation, which is an essential step in building a knowledge-based society. I should like to make a final remark on the additional budget that has been granted to the ‘People’ programme at the request of Mr Prodi and by the unanimous decision of the shadow rapporteurs, to whom I am grateful. That is a clear sign that the philosophy whereby people are the driving force behind research is both correct and successful.

Mr President, Mr Piebalgs, ladies and gentlemen, what has happened in recent weeks with the Suez-Enel case and what is happening at the moment regarding E.on’s bid for Endesa, which has been blocked by the Spanish Government’s decree increasing the powers of the national energy council, confirms a regressionist tendency of the Member States with regard to the principles and rules on which the European Union is based. Only yesterday, Mr Barroso said, ‘I hope that the heads of government will answer the question: do they have the political will to find European solutions to European problems?’ The energy problem has been examined by the Commission in all its aspects in a valuable, almost point-by-point analysis, which I do not want to go into here because it is well known to all. In the joint resolution tabled by the Group of the European People's Party (Christian Democrats) and European Democrats, the Socialist Group in the European Parliament, the Group of the Alliance of Liberals and Democrats for Europe and the Union for Europe of the Nations Group concerns are voiced that all European citizens today share, and solutions are put forward that a majority of citizens and Member States would like to see. On one point, however, the proposal is deficient, and that is in relation to the decision-making centres. How many are there, and which are they? In yesterday’s statement, again, Mr Barroso spoke of the existence of 25 different energy markets and 25 different policies in the sector. In addition to this devastating statistic with regard to the hoped-for converging policies of the EU, there is the need to guarantee the physical security of Europe’s energy infrastructure against the risks of natural disasters and terrorist attacks, as well as its security against political risks, including interruptions of supply. The question I put to each and every one of us is: ‘Can Europe be governed by 25 different governments, or has the moment perhaps been reached when European strategy regarding foreign policy, security and energy should have a single decision-making centre in order to be able to deal in a timely and consistent manner with the challenges now thrown up by the fast-moving modern world?’

Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, we find ourselves faced with two possible mergers. The first, between Gaz de France
 and Suez
, is undesirable, because it creates an energy monopoly in the Belgian gas and electricity sector and further closes off the French market to competitors. The second merger, however, between Enel
 and Suez
, could give rise to a diversification of the French and Belgian energy market. The principle of reciprocity in relations between European countries in the energy sector seems essential for a European energy market that benefits the consumer, and for a common European policy in the energy sector. In Italy, ample space has been given to energy companies from other countries by means of privatisation and liberalisation policies. This has also happened in other European countries. France’s breach of the principle of reciprocity in this case cannot be justified by a need to guarantee an autonomous energy sector by means of national champions, but is rather an expression of an excessively nationalistic policy. France already has its national energy champions: it does not need to create any more. The merger between Gaz de France
 and Suez
, which controls the Belgian company Electrabel
, carries a serious risk of encouraging protectionist trends, not only in the energy sector, but also in other industrial, financial and service sectors. In other cases, the European Commission has strictly applied its antitrust instruments to prevent the development of dominant positions and retaliation by international competition. This has happened recently in the cases of ABN-AMRO/Banca Antonveneta
, and BBVA/Banca Nazionale del Lavoro
, which now seems to have gone in favour of BNP Paribas
, a French bank. It is to be hoped that the Commission employs a similar strictness in ensuring the free movement of capital, because even in these circumstances the principle must apply to everyone, for we cannot allow some countries in Europe to be more equal than others.

Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, the current debate is of strategic importance in the ambit of the policies of the European Union. The problem that has been brought to our attention is that of the nuclear power plant at Bohunice in Slovakia and the concomitant problem of the use of financial resources for the decommissioning of nuclear power plants. The first problem relates to the application of Protocol No 9 on the Treaty and the Act of Accession of the Czech Republic, Estonia, Cyprus, Latvia, Lithuania, Hungary, Malta, Poland, Slovenia and Slovakia. Article 3 of this Protocol envisages follow-up financial assistance for the decommissioning of reactors 1 and 2 of the Bohunice plant. We consider that the greatest possible amount of funds must be committed to make reactors 1 and 2 at Bohunice safe during their decommissioning. Nevertheless the problem I want to bring up is that of the safety of our whole continent, and the related question of how such safety can be pursued together with suitable energy supply policies, applied with vigour. Such policies would need to guarantee a level of financial competitiveness in the European system commensurate with the challenges of innovation and development. In Europe today there are 155 power-generating reactors, of which at least one-third will have to be decommissioned in the next few years. The decommissioning of 50 or 60 reactors will involve expenditure that realistically will be close to EUR 50 billion. Given that most of these reactors are situated in new Member States, and are therefore less sound both structurally and financially, the first problem that the Commission must confront is putting in place a systematic plan for helping and supporting such countries with their decommissioning. A second problem concerns the need to set up an in-depth cost-benefit analysis of a nuclear plant, setting these indicators against installation and decommissioning costs in relation obviously to the average lifespan of the reactors that have been installed. On the basis of the results of such a study, it will be possible and proper to make bold, lasting decisions in one direction or the other. A final problem, no less serious, concerns what happens outside Europe. Today there are 440 reactors in operation throughout the world, while 25 more are under construction. Post-Chernobyl, world public opinion has been astounded at the run-down state and the serious dangers posed to humanity by numerous reactors, many of which are situated in the former Soviet Union. That being so, is it not the duty of Parliament to recommend to the Commission that negotiations should be opened with the United States and Russia and all affected states, to establish a policy to clean up the entire planet and make it safer?

Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I will not keep to the speech that I had prepared and I apologise for that, but the speech made by Mr Schmit forces me to hurriedly change the scope of my speech. I find the expression ‘the same job, the same pay’ completely outrageous. I say that as a lawyer, as a legal expert: it is unthinkable that a Member can portray himself as an employee who is given a wage. The Member has an allowance and therefore a sense of dignity, and if we want to give that back to Parliament, we are the first ones obliged to respect its rules, which are also rules of behaviour, in addition to written, and sometimes disobeyed, rules. Among those rules, European law has to guarantee equality. I ask Mr Schmit whether there is a principle of equality by which, a five-star hotel room in one of the new Member States costs the equivalent of EUR 40, as was our experience two weeks’ ago in Krakow, Poland, whilst it costs the equivalent of EUR 500 or EUR 700 for a hotel of the same standard in Rome, Paris or any other European capital. Whilst you can dine out on EUR 10 in a restaurant in one of the countries of the East, a restaurant of the same quality in Italy, Germany or France charges EUR 70, EUR 80 or EUR 100. Today, we are playing a part, fully aware that we are being hypocritical at least. From a legal point of view, I believe that it is unacceptable, partly because the interpretation that we are going to give – and I am only talking about Articles 9 and 10, Mr President – is that the Members are entitled to a fair allowance, enough to give them an independent living. What constitutes fairness and independence for a Member, however? Independence with regard to what, if then, in Article 10, the Member’s dignity is regarded as 38.5% of the basic salary of a judge in the Court of Justice? I ask that that be not mentioned; the allowance required should still be laid down, but not by linking it to that of a civil servant. The Member’s dignity stems from his direct election by the people. Being elected by an Italian electorate of 15 million voters, as I was, is not the same as becoming a Member in an ordered list, produced by the parties in another country where a person has no expenses ...

Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I would first of all like to congratulate Mr Böge on his ability to create a synthesis from the various trends that emerged, and, therefore, for the fine work carried out. I would also like to make a brief observation on the trilogy of Parliament, the Commission and the Council. The first two advocate keeping the commitment appropriations at the current level or slightly less (1.18% and 1.24%). In contrast, the Council defends the prerogatives of the Member States, which are worried – and are even more so after the votes of France and the Netherlands on the Constitution – about the unrest gripping the Union like a vice; they delude themselves that, by reducing the funds, they can protect their respective positions, which are exposed to the dangers represented by China, India, the United States, global revolution, competitiveness and innovation. Ours is a composite society, which lives beyond its means and which is increasingly at risk as a result of inflexible institutions, a government with limited sovereignty and a soulless Central Bank. Reducing the interventions now instead of increasing them, as in my opinion is necessary ... (The President cut off the speaker)

Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, the case under examination very closely affects the existence of thousands of companies and the employment of millions of European citizens, including 570 000 Italians in the textile industry alone. On top of that, there is the footwear industry and other sectors all in line to be hit by the Chinese tsunami effect. The end of import quotas owing to the expiry of the Multifibre Agreement, the entry into force of the EU-China bilateral agreement of 2000 and the counterfeiting of the EC trademark were the subject of three questions that I addressed to the Council and the Commission on 6 January of this year. Concerned by the consequences, I sought to find out what provisions the Commission intended to adopt, given that the principles upon which the WTO rules are based (the environment, work, non-harmful products, counterfeiting) were being violated by China. The replies were of a provisional nature and, even today, the Commission – perhaps a prisoner of a mistaken rigour in interpreting the law – behaves more like a notary than a political, governing body. To all of the above must be added the impact that the REACH Regulation will have on the competitiveness of businesses: Europe is anxious to apply and to export an increasing number of principles and values, which is entirely proper, whilst China and other countries are concerned to produce tights, shoes, knitwear and suchlike at low cost and export them to Europe, with the gratifying outcome for Europe of witnessing the progress and higher levels of employment achieved by exporting countries. The picture would appear almost complete if we consider that relocations favour large European companies, but impoverish Europe, whose white collar workers and capital, together with equipment and machinery, are emigrating elsewhere, leaving thousands of unemployed workers clinging to the dream of social values. The Europe of knowledge, research and innovation cannot be divorced from the Europe of competitive production. It is a matter of cause and effect. A distinguished and most humble monk, Saint Benedict of Nursia, was fond of repeating the words ‘Pray and work’ to each of his brothers, in order that the abstraction of prayer did not distract from the reality of life. We must reflect on the extensive resources that we still possess, on the very many regions addressed in Objective 1, and on the support policies. A new strategy needs to be drawn up, and we need to additionally consider the poverty and needs that exist in Europe itself, including its requirement for harmonious development. We need to assess, moreover, whether vulnerable regions can truly hope for genuine development and whether they can attract European companies to relocate onto their soil. That would perhaps be possible if well-equipped business districts and a modern system of tax breaks were created in those very regions.
