Madam President, on the basis of Rule 154 and Rule 155(2) of the Rules of Procedure, the Group of the Alliance of Liberals and Democrats for Europe would like to endorse the request by the Group of the Greens/European Free Alliance to change the voting order of the amendments and to put Amendments 1 c, p, 2, 5, 6 and 9 to the vote before Compromise Amendment 10. This also relates, among other things – perhaps there is something else on your voting lists – to the fact that, following the motion adopted by our Group yesterday, Compromise Amendment 10 will no longer be supported by the ALDE Group. As regards the voting procedure, Rule 154 explains which amendment is to be dealt with first when there are corresponding or conflicting requests. It is important to us that a court ruling be issued before any intervention in the behaviour of individuals can take place. That is why we have withdrawn the amendment.

Madam President, as rapporteur for the directive on data protection in the area of electronic communications, I would firstly like to thank Mr Harbour, who has given a whole new meaning to the concept of enhanced cooperation. It was not the first procedure of this kind, but in this form it was probably the most fruitful. I would like to thank Commissioner Reding, who was present at each of the trialogues and personally played a part, something which nowadays cannot be said for all Commissioners. I believe we were able to show, that, above all, the best consumer protection is effective data protection; that at a time when people surf the Internet and do not know exactly what is going on behind their screens, it is particularly important that they should be enlightened. We have taken up the Commission’s proposal to make the notification of security breaches compulsory, and have improved it. It is a procedure that will be implemented in stages and has been developed in cooperation with national regulators, telecommunications providers and policy-makers. I am delighted with the Commission’s announcement that by the end of 2011 a horizontal directive will be submitted to this end, because it makes no sense to simply address this in the area of electronic communications. At the same time we have ensured that it is mandatory to obtain the consent of the user for the storage of programs or applications, including personal data, which are on the hard disk. In this regard I would also briefly like to mention that we have developed the original proposals very closely with the industry concerned. For some parts of the industry it did not go far enough or it went too far. They then caused trouble and confusion in the Council and the Commission, before in the end wanting a return to what had originally been put forward, because they did not like the compromise proposals. The lesson from history is that, as institutions, we should have faith in the fact that we can cooperate well together, and should not let those who have other interests drive a wedge between us. To conclude I would once more like to refer to my fellow Member Mrs Trautmann’s report. Some in my Group and others will not agree to a kind of ‘three strikes and out’ law. We need judicial control before net access is blocked.

The European Parliament voted today on Mr Casaca’s report on discharge in respect of the implementation of the budget of the European Parliament for the 2007 budgetary year. The report also addressed the question of the pension fund of the European Parliament. The European Parliament pension fund is a voluntary pension fund. The pension fund has now got into financial difficulties and a deficit has accrued. The Free Democratic Party in the European Parliament is opposed to using tax revenue to clear the deficit. It is irresponsible to expect European taxpayers to pay for these losses. Any such plans should be averted. The Free Democratic Party in the European Parliament voted against discharge in respect of the implementation of the European Parliament’s budget. The possibility of using tax revenue to clear the deficit has not been totally excluded.

 The legal basis used, Article 13(1) of the EC Treaty, is not appropriate considering that, in the opinion of the German Free Democratic Party (FDP), the principle of subsidiarity is not being observed. It is not within the remit of the EU legislator to lay down the regulations in question, thereby seriously encroaching on the self-determination of the Member States.  Combating discrimination of all kinds and bringing about participation in public life by the disabled are important jobs. Proposing to extend the anti-discrimination regulations to practically all areas of life is out of touch with reality, however. The reversal of the burden of proof laid down in the directive will mean that it is possible to open legal proceedings on the basis of accusations not backed up by sufficient evidence. Those affected would then have to pay compensation even if they have not actually committed any acts of discrimination but are unable to prove their innocence. Defined in this sweeping way, this reversal of the burden of proof is therefore questionable from the point of view of its compatibility with acting as a state under the rule of law. It will create uncertainty and facilitate abuse. That cannot be the raison d’être
 of a progressive anti-discrimination policy. A further consideration must be that the Commission is currently pursuing infringement proceedings against numerous Member States in relation to inadequate transposal of the existing European directives on anti-discrimination policy. There is as yet, however, no overview of those regulations that have been transposed so as to make it possible to determine the need for new regulations that has been claimed. Germany, in particular, has already gone far beyond previous stipulations from Brussels. We therefore voted against this report.

 Madam President, I would ask the President of the House to consider, in spite of what Martin Schulz said, that we should follow Voltaire, especially as I come from a Liberal group: even if I did not share an iota of what this person had to say, I consider that he has the right to express his view – as those two had. I believe in equal treatment, and we can deal with an opinion. We should not take away the right of free speech on this issue, even if I do not agree at all with what he has to say.

Mr President, I should like to start by congratulating Mr Lambrinidis on a job well done. He fully involved all the shadow rapporteurs during the drafting of this report and did his very best to reach compromises. This report, which addresses the important questions of the information society, is an important step towards creating an Internet which guarantees both security for our citizens and their fundamental freedoms. The borders between freedom and security do not end at the borders of the virtual world. He has taken account in his report of the fight against cybercrime, child pornography, identity theft and fraud, as well as copyright violation. He has tried to involve Europol and makes clear that the current laws of the physical world must also apply to the virtual world. At the same time, he has managed to strike a balance between the protection of civil rights, freedom of expression, data protection and the right to the complete deletion of data on the Internet. Up to the present day, the Internet does not forget. Some of us can be glad that the Internet did not exist when we were still 13, 14, 15 or 16 years old, when we committed the sins of youth which we would not now want to find on YouTube or Facebook. He has highlighted the need for access to information and, more importantly, access to the Internet and respect for intellectual property. I am well aware that for many Members the report does not go far enough in respect of the protection of intellectual property and copyright. Let us work on that with the IP enforcement directive and highlight these points in that directive. This report makes clear that censorship on the Internet or blocking access to the network, as planned or already implemented by some Member States in Europe, are measures not worthy of our enlightened society and it also makes clear that the European Union is not following the example of totalitarian states and cutting its citizens off from information or feeding them information on a need to know basis. I am delighted that we have a balanced report here which takes account of the demands of an information society and I would be delighted if both my and other groups gave this report the broadest possible support tomorrow, so that we can develop an Internet in the interests of society.

 Mr President, Mr Vice-President of the Commission, I would like to thank the rapporteur for her efforts and her initiative on this report. Protecting children while they are using the Internet and combating child pornography are two of the most urgent issues which we have to deal with. For me, it is very important to ensure that this Framework Decision on combating the sexual exploitation of children and child pornography offers a higher level of protection. The abuse of children over the Internet can only be handled as a joint initiative at a European level, because the Internet is not subject to national boundaries. There are three points in this report which I believe are in need of improvement. Firstly, a balance must be maintained between children’s security and data protection. We must take into consideration not only children’s personal data, but also the personal data of people and content which is relevant for the purpose of providing this protection for children. As well as creating criminal offences for Internet users and suppliers of child pornography, we must first identify the people behind these dreadful activities and arrest them. We can only combat this abuse successfully by attacking it at the roots. We must also target those people who make these services, these appalling criminal activities, available to others and who profit from them. As well as criminalising the offenders, as described in Mrs Angelilli’s report, we must also raise awareness among people who look after children and explain the risks involved in Internet use. We must focus on developing new technological methods and establishing the principle of privacy by design. In addition, we must promote the exchange of information and experiences between the individual authorities in the Member States. The data protection authorities in the Member States can act as important intermediaries in this respect. Only an all-embracing approach will be successful. However, I do not approve of making Internet service providers into an extension of the law enforcement agencies. A much better solution is the implementation of agreements which allow Internet service providers to collaborate with the law enforcement agencies on a voluntary basis, as is already the case. Child pornography in all its manifestations is no more and no less than a crime against humanity. We must put every effort into combating it. We must ensure that the Member States cooperate with us and that we in Parliament are all moving in the same direction. On this basis, the members of the Group of the Alliance of Liberals and Democrats for Europe will support Mrs Angelilli’s report.

 Madam President, Mr Vice-President of the Commission, I believe that what Mr Kreissl-Dörfler has said is right. I would like to thank Mr Fava for his report and for the excellent work that he has done. The report makes it clear that both parties involved in illegal employment must be held equally liable, which will create a legal balance. Illegal employment must be penalised and prohibited in all Member States. Employers must be made responsible for upholding this ban, but it is also the job of the relevant authorities to monitor the observance of the ban and to impose penalties. The most important issue is to protect the people in these employment relationships from exploitation. Establishing legal penalties certainly represents a step forward. However, the authorities must put in place more controls and prosecute those suspected of committing offences. The report is a compromise between the Council and the European Parliament and specifies minimum standards. Nevertheless, the prospect of Member States strengthening or weakening the requirements is not inspiring. We have taken the first step forward. Now we should go the rest of the way together. I think I can say, at least for myself and on behalf of parts of my group, if not for the majority, that we can support this report in good conscience.

 Mr President, welcome Commissioner, tomorrow we will vote on the report prepared by my fellow Member, Mr Cappato, on public access to documents. Mr Cashman, a very good and normally unbelievably efficient colleague, has already pointed out that the most important thing is to give the public access to documents that are discussed and decided upon here. One might accuse Mr Cappato, as Mr Herrero-Tejedor and Mr Cashman have done, of going beyond the remit. That is surely a matter of interpretation and in this case also not entirely justified. The discussion as to whether or not, in principle, the group meetings should be broadcast is surely something we can talk about. The question is, then, whether we would have the right, for example, to hold such a meeting in private at the request of the majority of the group members, as there are certainly sensitive issues – as we all know from our own meetings – that need to be clarified between ourselves before we can go public with them. In my opinion, it is normal to wash your dirty laundry at home and not out in the street. I might also add that this example shows that political parties – not the party groups in this case – always have a certain interest in the general public when it suits them. Otherwise, party conferences would not be broadcast so extensively. Interestingly, no one complains that the conferences of some political parties where things can get quite lively could be broadcast in full. I think I can say, therefore, that Mr Cappato has produced a good piece of work here, even though – as we are accustomed to – suggestions for improvement may perhaps come from other groups. In some cases they are, in fact, so good that they should be considered. Compared to either of the other institutions, Parliament can still be considered to lead the way when it comes to transparency and so I would not make it my top priority, since with regard to both the accessibility of documents and to the transparency of its sittings and the activities of the Members of the European Parliament, we are more open than any national parliament. That does not mean that there is no need for improvement, including in other institutions, particularly the Council, which, regrettably, is not here now. Mr Cashman has just said that we need to know who has made what decision and how in order to be able to establish accountability for political actions. It is even more important, however, to provide access to documents produced within the framework of the comitology procedure, for example. A specific example is the Regulation on liquids in hand luggage, the annex to which was not accessible to citizens, and neither was it accessible to parliamentarians. The requirement for transparency has not been introduced in most Member States of the European Union without good reason, and that is to give the people the opportunity to understand the political activities, to be able to establish accountability and then perhaps also to enable different decisions to be made in elections. Thank you very much for the extra time, Mr President. Good luck, Marco. I will be with you in the vote tomorrow, and I believe that we will bring this to a satisfactory conclusion.

 Mr President, the agreement that has been reached on the climate action and renewable energy package is a modest result. The EU has set itself the target of a 20% reduction below 1990 levels. We have achieved almost half of this already by means of our enlargement to the east, where emissions are lower in absolute terms, and there remains the target of a 12% reduction below 1990 levels. The EU is permitted to achieve 3-4% of the reduction in the developing world, which means that just under 9% remains. Missing the target by up to 5% is permitted, which leaves 4%. It could be said at this point that we are lucky that the EU has decided not to export its entire economy to Asia straight away. The compromise is significantly cheaper than the Commission’s proposal, which has meant that the German Free Democratic Party can support it. Instead, the EU is now playing its own Member States off against one another. Some Member States are at an advantage on account of derogations, negotiating skill and their energy mix. German energy providers could soon find it worthwhile generating electricity in Poland instead of at home – if they are not bought up by French providers, that is. The fact that the EU Member States are engaging in such horse-trading does not bode well for a global agreement. Besides, the issue arises as to the efficiency of the means. It is now up to governments, the Council and the European Commission to ensure efficiency, both in environmental protection and for the benefit of the economy and growth.

Madam President, Mrs Yade, Mr Vice-President of the Commission, today, we celebrated the 20th 
anniversary of the Sakharov Prize, and last week saw the 60th 
anniversary of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights – and these two events have never been so relevant. We must reinforce our on-going efforts to implement human and fundamental rights, not only in Europe but also worldwide. Mrs Yade, I have the greatest respect for you for having the courage to criticise your own government’s relations with Libya here. Not everyone would dare to do that, and I believe that that is what is known as ‘first putting one’s own house in order’. In 2004, the European Parliament was assured that there was a group of Commissioners who would concern themselves with fundamental rights. I am afraid that we have yet to be presented with a report on this; and, unfortunately, we have seen violations of freedom to travel in Italy, of freedom of expression in Member States, and of the right to individual privacy, among other things, in the United Kingdom. Fundamental rights are like muscles: if they are not used, they waste away. Help us now to exercise this muscle, to enable us to rediscover a basis for decent coexistence in our societies in the future, too.

I fully support the introduction of the Blue Card. However, with the adoption of the PPE and PSE amendments, I fear that Europe’s forward-looking strategy on legal migration will soon vanish into thin air. The current text is simply off-putting to most highly qualified workers considering legal immigration to the EU. Highly qualified workers will not be encouraged to work on the EU labour market, not least because of the bureaucratic obstacles that were endorsed in the current text.

 Mr President, both before and after the European elections, we shall be hearing the usual regrettable assessment that Europe is too far removed from its citizens. I ask myself what the European Parliament is doing about this. Some time ago, a colleague and I launched an online petition, which is being dealt with in committee just like other petitions. Approximately one-and-a-half million people have signed this online petition; a figure roughly equivalent to the population of Estonia. Under pressure from the Chairman of the Committee on Petitions, Mr Libicki, this matter was taken to the Conference of Presidents with the request that a debate be permitted in Parliament on how online petitions are to be dealt with in principle. The fact that the petition concerned is about the seat of Parliament should be irrelevant, as we often discuss controversial issues – and I am also aware that not everyone shares my opinion. Yet the failure to permit such a debate and the complaints about how far removed Europe is from its citizens are mutually incompatible. I should like the Conference of Presidents to do something about this and perhaps bear it in mind when Europe’s distance from its citizens is lamented again.

Mr President, on Tuesday five Members from four different political groups put up a large poster to publicise written declaration No 75. The requisite authorisation was obtained from the competent quaestor, Mr Fazakas, before the poster went on display. Someone removed the poster on Tuesday afternoon without informing any of the authors of the written declaration. Yesterday we could not find it at all. Today we discovered that it is with the security service. The reason given to us was that a political decision had been taken to the effect that this written declaration could not be advertised. Since when has the administration decided what is politically right and wrong, particularly after the competent quaestor has given his approval? We are democratic Members of Parliament with the right to state our position. You do not have to agree with the content of the declaration, but removing the poster without informing the authors is wrong; it is a preposterous curtailment of Members’ rights. I ask you to comment on this matter. (Applause)

 Mr President, President-in-Office of the Council, Commission Vice-President, with their reports, Mrs Lefrançois and Mrs Roure have done a great deal of work, and I have also been delighted to have been able to work together with them as they did so. We have achieved a lot and also made a big difference. I regret that Mrs Roure’s report is still stuck in the Council even though we have revised it. In this regard I feel the things Mr Jouyet spoke about are lacking somewhat, namely that we seize on topics and declare them a priority. We also heard this repeatedly and most recently from the German Council Presidency. Unfortunately, it has just not been translated into action. Parliament cannot be satisfied in the long run purely with lip service. With regard to the report by Mrs Lefrançois: there is definitely something remarkable in this report that none of you has yet addressed. It implies that we have here one of the rare cases in which we are harmonising substantive criminal law – quite clearly beyond the field of the environment. This is something that goes way beyond what the European Union has been doing until now. In civil law we have seen it in cross-border matters. However, harmonising substantive criminal law goes much deeper than has been broached here. Hence the Commission understands perhaps why we are conducting such an intensive discussion on public provocation or incitement. ‘Incitement’ is a normal judicial term in every Member State. The member states of the Council of Europe decided on the term ‘provocation’ as a compromise. This also includes countries such as Russia. I do not believe that we have to discuss whether we all have a common legal basis with this. I have also continued to make it clear in discussions with Mrs Lefrançois that, from my national perspective alone, I have a problem with the term ‘incitement’, as it is also worded here, because the fact that an incitement can be punished without there being a premeditated unlawful predicate crime is alien to our system. In that the clause allows for incitement or provocation, both these terms are at worst even a bluff. They both fail to show premeditation on the part of the perpetrator. It is solely dependent on the perception of third parties whether what someone has said could be a serious provocation to commit a terrorist offence or not. At the moment I am wondering where you draw the line between the terrorist and the irate citizen around the regulars’ table who is denounced by his neighbour. In this respect we must also touch upon the existing legal systems. I know that it is different in some respects in Spain, but this is so that it can combat home-grown terrorism. Believe me, I am thankful that I am young enough not to have lived through the bad times of the RAF in Germany, but then, too, appropriate laws were discussed. Of course countries must act exceptionally in special cases, but in the last seven years we have also seen that much of what was decided at the outset in a frenzy of activity must now be retracted. In this respect I am also glad that we have been focusing on people and fundamental rights across party lines in this report. With regard to the Roure report, it is much more critical that the Council takes action. We must not fool ourselves with regard to the Treaty of Lisbon. We all want it to stand until the European elections in 2009, but we also know that I want never gets. We now have to try to weave this report into these discussions – particularly with regard to the talks currently being conducted by the Commission with the United States on an EU/US data protection agreement. Indeed, the two cannot be allowed to exist independently of each other. Hence I should like us not only to seize the political will, but ultimately also to take a political decision, to enable the Framework Decision on data protection to finally come into force. The Commission and Council are striving, with an incredible amount of activity, to take action in the field of the economic protection of personal data. When we see what is happening in the United Kingdom, Germany and other Member States, where there are cases of loss or theft of personal data administered by public authorities, we have just as urgent a need for action here. This is ultimately more than ever about citizens’ rights, as they are not able to prevent their government behaving in this way. With enterprises, the citizen is still able to choose a different one in case of doubt.

Madam President, if you granted me the same speaking time as the three previous speakers, that would suit me fine. I should observe in passing, however, that I was under the impression that I would have two and a half minutes. So as not to waste any of that time, let me thank Malcolm Harbour, Catherine Trautmann and Pilar del Castillo Vera for our truly outstanding cooperation, to which Malcolm has already referred. We tackled this issue without friction in a spirit of mutual trust and in particularly close cooperation. It is, unfortunately, too late now to correct the structural defect of having the two directives lumped together. Nevertheless, let me say in the brief time at my disposal that I am very pleased that the Commission addressed the general issue of data privacy, albeit rather superficially. The fact is, Commissioner, that you would probably not give me your credit-card details, your telephone number and your address, even if I asked nicely. The problem, when you are on the Net, is that much of this information may well be there already, in places you cannot imagine and where you would not like it to be. To that extent I am pleased that I was able, in cooperation with other groups and Members, to help ensure that the right of consumers to have their personal details treated confidentially and their personal systems protected will be incorporated into this package. I see that time is running out, but I do hope we shall have more opportunities to discuss this or that issue more thoroughly. May I therefore say thank you again for our constructive cooperation, and perhaps we shall manage to advance the development of data privacy in Europe for the benefit of consumers.
 Alexander Alvaro  (ALDE

Madam President, this gives me an unexpected opportunity to respond to Mrs Harms’ contribution, which I shall do with the greatest of pleasure, for the distinction between suggestions and facts, I believe, is certainly discernible in the report. We have essentially incorporated a judgment of the Federal Constitutional Court that created a new fundamental right. The right to the confidentiality and integrity of IT systems was the first thing to be enshrined in this legislative act. We have thus acted faster than any Member State, particularly my own. Publicly accessible private networks have also been included, services like Facebook, Bebo, etc., that have hitherto lain completely outside the scope of directive. What about cookies, similar software or other applications that transmit user data back to home base, as it were, without the consumer’s prior consent – will they become a thing of the past? Consumers have given their prior consent, in principle, in respect of everything in their computers, mobiles and other applications belonging to, or even accessible to, third parties. In future, location information can only be captured anonymously or with the prior consent of the consumer. Unsolicited marketing, irritating text messages, stupid e-mails and the like – the directive will rule out all of these things. Notification of the data-protection authorities will be mandatory in future whenever any authority searches for anyone’s personal data. Last but not least, we have created a clearer framework for the notification requirement in the event of security breaches and the loss of data than has existed to date. Since we were talking about suggestions before, I do not wish to omit that we are considering how to deal with IP addresses, because IP addresses – and we must not confuse these things – are not the data that are being traded, which are personal data, credit-card details, etc., and even if they were traded – just to explain this briefly – an IP address is not necessarily a personal characteristic, at least not when your fridge transmits a message to your computer.

 Madam President, my thanks also to the rapporteur, Mr Weber, although he might like to overlook me and particularly my colleague Mrs Hennis-Plasschaert, who, together with the other rapporteurs, have pushed this difficult process forward over the last three years through rough seas and into calm waters. At this point I would just like to be allowed to say that I find it mischievous and dishonourable for people to link the tragedy of deaths in the Mediterranean with this Directive, as, realistically, they have nothing to do with each other. This must not be allowed! This Directive creates legal certainty for people where there is none. The lot in life of people currently living in undignified conditions, who do not know when they are going to be returned to their countries, and do not have access to judicial authorities, will be improved. It sets minimum standards for 27 Member States, and for one third of the Member States, which have no standards at all, this is better than the current situation. It is the first step towards an urgently needed common asylum policy and Europe-wide respect for human dignity. I believe that everyone who wants to take that step with us should take that responsibility seriously and vote in favour of this report.
 Alexander Alvaro  (ALDE

 Mr President, even if it is too late to say so, I think that the Member’s objection may have been misunderstood. He wanted a vote on Paragraph 65, fifth indent. You had a vote on whether family members may be employed. Paragraph 65, fifth indent does not regulate that, but whether payments can be suspended in the event that there is suspicion of malpractice. We did not vote on that, or you announced something incorrectly. Just so that we clear that up, so that everyone knows what is happening.
 Alexander Alvaro,

. – (DE) 
Mr President, I believe I am speaking on behalf of my group when I say that we had excellent cooperation with the rapporteur. We cooperated very closely, as Mr Reul has just said. Nonetheless, we have to ask why it is so urgent to take a decision, why it has to be taken now and, in particular, before the end of the year. We would have been very happy to see the Lisbon Treaty rules apply here, such as judicial review, as also proper participation in the sense of codecision with the European Parliament. As regards the data protection aspect that was addressed here, Prüm has its own data protection rules, and then there are the implementing rules and the treaty rules. Indeed Mrs Dührkop Dührkop also noted the need for a framework decision in the third pillar. If we take a careful look at the categories of data regulated by the Prüm Treaty, we see that it is more than necessary to have framework legislation on the matter. We must also ask why so-called special categories of data are included, such as data providing information on sexual orientation, health, political and union activities, and religious belief. That goes far beyond the basic data needed in relation to organised crime. There are restrictions on the use of that data yet it remains incredible that it can be used at all. In the case of DNA data, we strongly support the rapporteur’s view that – if that data is necessary and if it can be exchanged – it must be clearly restricted and used only for the purpose for which it was intended. Furthermore, it must be made clear that Member States which do not have national DNA databases are not obliged to establish them. I want to finish by saying that it would be very sensible – as personal exchanges of views with police authorities have brought to light – if, instead of concentrating on legislative measures, we financed programmes to assist the exchange of personnel between police forces. That would be sure to improve cooperation in the Union. It is astonishing that the funding has not yet been clarified given that the decision is to be taken very soon. Before spending money, people should know how much is to be spent, before taking a decision people should know how much it costs.
 Alexander Alvaro  (ALDE

(DE) 
Madam President, we also discussed this issue in the Committee on Civil Liberties, Justice and Home Affairs, and there is no one on that committee who does not sympathise with the situation in which the new Member States find themselves, particularly with regard to visa policy and bilateral dealings with the United States. Yet there are also older Member States – Greece was mentioned in this context – which are similarly waiting for a change in US visa policy. No one, then, is questioning their right to break ranks, but we must ask whether what is legal is necessarily legitimate. In this case it is not legitimate, because it undermines a united approach on the part of the European Union and thereby obstructs the conclusion of an agreement that would apply to the whole territory of the European Union. A step-by-step approach is essential. We have just managed to deal with the new members’ accession to the Schengen Area. The next step is to consider how we can obtain a general arrangement on the visa issue. One final word: I find the threat with the Treaty of Lisbon utterly disgraceful.
 Alexander Alvaro  (ALDE

(DE) 
Mr President, I must admit that I like this ‘catch the eye’ arrangement, particularly the part before the countdown starts. We undoubtedly have much to discuss in the realm of data protection. Some members from the Greens Group addressed the subject of data pertaining to private businesses and individuals. Mergers like the one between Google and DoubleClick certainly do raise some questions. Nevertheless, care should be taken not to confuse one thing with another. However many frogs croak, the result will only ever be a croaking sound. What I mean is that we should not forget the need to understand the underlying technical processes too. We – and my political group is certainly no exception – often take a particularly close interest in matters relating to the Internet and, of course, data privacy and frequently respond to them in a highly emotional way. If I am to grasp how the Internet and data capture work, however, I must first understand the underlying technology. In this respect, I believe there is much to be said for Mr Weber’s approach of ascertaining first of all the extent to which IP addresses might constitute personal data within the meaning of Directive 2002/58 on privacy and electronic communications, for in some cases the IP address in conjunction with user data certainly can be the key to the collection of personal information. On the other hand, given the state of technological development today, when fridges, for example, can automatically retrieve recipes from the Internet, the question whether the IP address of my fridge truly constitutes personal data is obsolete.

Mr President, many thanks to Mr Deprez and Mr Guardans Cambó for their comments. I think they are very much in line with our group's position. The report is entitled 'The factors favouring support for terrorism and the recruitment of terrorists'. Other speakers have welcomed the fact that we are talking about this issue, and they are right to do so. However, we are not discussing it for the first time. The European Parliament and the Union as a whole have talked about the preachers of hate and have taken preventive measures to cut off the flow of funds to terrorist organisations. These are certainly useful measures. In that respect, I think that the report largely hits the right note. I think it would be slightly overstating the case to view the Internet as the root of all evil or as a safe haven. It is undoubtedly a space which reflects social trends just as much as real life does, and I do not believe that we should be focusing all our efforts on quelling it once and for all. We simply will not manage it. The question, then, is what can we do instead? We have talked about audiovisual services, and the question which arises here is: why does the European Union not take action if certain channels are broadcasting hate programmes on EU territory that are aimed directly at children? In one of Hezbollah's programmes, for example, a figure disguised as Mickey Mouse – in whatever form – attacks Jewish settlers. This is intended to teach small Palestinian children about their history. It is not the case that a Member State intervened to put an end to this problem. Instead, the Walt Disney company asserted its rights over Mickey Mouse, and at the end of the series, Mickey Mouse was killed off by a Jewish settler. This was broadcast on European territory! Why is Hezbollah still not on the EU's list of terrorist organisations? We have just had an interesting discussion with Dick Marty on this issue. I believe that, in general, more building blocks are needed to curb terrorism as a whole. This must certainly include tackling the roots of terrorism in the countries concerned, for example by creating healthcare systems, infrastructure and education systems. We should not leave it to terrorist organisations like Hamas in the Gaza Strip or Hezbollah to provide these services, for these havens within society are the very places where these organisations recruit their supporters.

 Mr President, I am delighted that you have given us leave to speak again, as that has been handled differently in another debate. Nonetheless, although Mr Pirker and I may not always see eye to eye – we often argue, and do so with great enjoyment and fervour — he is quite right to say that such debates should not be abused for national purposes. It disrupts everything and it simply leads to false compromises. I am sure that the Spanish colleagues here in the House will give a different answer. I simply know from my own experience that this type of thing is very often dragged into the national debate. I am also getting rather tired of the fact that – not for the first time – we are being used as a ping pong ball between the PPE-DE and the PSE on these matters. However, I am glad that the Liberals have been able to mediate and are still up to the challenge. Our colleague from Northern Ireland is unfortunately no longer present. I find that rather galling because he said something that I view as quite incredible: he said that terrorists do not have the same basic human rights as everyone else. However, that is precisely what distinguishes us from terrorists: the fact that we regard human rights as universal. We should never give the impression that this House could ever take a different view.
 Alexander Alvaro  (ALDE

Mr President, what can be affirmed is the fact that not only do the Council and the Commission place greater emphasis on the term ‘security’ in their documents, but they also appear to have become increasingly aware of citizens’ basic freedoms and rights. We in Europe, however, can do as much work as we want on the common area of freedom, security and law when third countries’ legal systems are apparently impeding us in this exercise. I believe that the Commission, and specifically the Member States too, should be increasingly monitoring the extent to which the US legal system, for example, is impacting on the households of European citizens. The Commission and the Council will find themselves faced with a question from me and some of my colleagues, asking how it is possible that mail transfer data from the United States, which to all intents and purposes should be used only for customs purposes, is being passed on to the security authorities. The confidentiality of mail is one of the last bastions we have so far been able to protect. I hope that the Commission in cooperation with the Council will be able to resolve the problem of a global approach to combating terrorism and organised crime not only from the security aspect, but also from the aspect of freedom, protection of citizens and elimination of the problems of conflicting legal systems.

Madam President, Mr Vice-President, Minister, before I begin I should like to thank Mr°Díaz de Mera García Consuegra for his constructive and outstanding cooperation. Our teamwork, including with colleagues from the Socialist Group in the European Parliament, has been very good despite, incidentally, the isolated case where the Socialists criticised the rapporteur. We have no misgivings at all about the expansion of Europol, which was founded in 1994 as the European Drug Unit and was converted into Europol, as we now know it, in 1999. This is necessary to protect our population in the fight against organised crime, which does not stop at borders, whether these be sea, land or air. In the same way, Europe’s officials must be able to take action and deal with it. It must be equally clear, however, that there are certain ground rules in police work. Immunity of Europol officers, as is regulated in the codicil, does not make sense. This has to be said. It does not make sense that Europe’s police officers should have more powers as Europol officers than others do. Nor does it make sense that there are no parliamentary controls over police cooperation. After all, we want to create an efficient authority, which can also be called to account for any mistakes it may make, and not the Sheriff of Nottingham! The same applies to the judicial scrutiny of Europol. It is inconceivable that a police authority in Europe should be able to act without its actions being subject to judicial review. As a result we Liberals (our colleague Mr Pirker has perhaps misunderstood this) have introduced an amendment, whereby a revision clause is to be adopted, as Mr Fava has already stated, so that the European Parliament is able to deal with this once again six months after the Treaty of Lisbon comes into force. As for the rest, we – that is the Group of the Alliance of Liberals and Democrats for Europe, at least – also expect a clear statement from the Council here that this revision clause is being considered and included in the negotiations. In the face of a structural majority, we would not wish to make use of Article 53 or Article 168 of the Rules of procedure, that is, referral to the Committee, because we, too, believe that we need Europol now and that its expansion should not be delayed. However, when forced to, we must act in this way.
 Alexander Alvaro (ALDE
). 
 – (DE) 
Madam President, because I had the feeling that the Minister had misunderstood this, I just wanted to take the liberty very briefly of pointing out the fact that the revision clause does not in any way jeopardise or influence ratification of the Treaty, but simply guarantees that after ratification, Parliament will once again deal with the Europol report. After consultation with other permanent representatives, it does not seem to me that this threat is seen as general.

Mr President, I do not think there is much to be added to what Mrs Kallenbach has just said, other than that it has been a pleasure for me to work alongside the Chairman of the Committee on the Internal Market and Consumer Protection, Arlene McCarthy, and my colleague on that Committee, Gisela Kallenbach, with whom I worked very closely with great confidence during this phase of the process. Not least, I would also like to thank the Commission, represented in this case by Commissioner Verheugen. Such close cooperation is a rare commodity. What can you say in a minute when you have taken 30 seconds to thank people? In essence, what we have achieved is this: the European Union has sent out a clear message that, when it regulates the legal firearms trade, it is equally concerned about tackling the illegal transfer and abuse of firearms. We have made it clear that the European Union will not tolerate any form of crime involving firearms on its territory, that we will not tolerate people using weapons which they have not acquired through a legal process, and we will not tolerate a situation in which people abuse the rights they have acquired through the EU. I say this to everyone who has today received countless e-mails, as I have, from hunters and sports marksmen accusing us in the European Union of restricting their freedoms: read the directive, contact the Commission and you will see that the European Union has taken action to protect its citizens, not the reverse!

 Mr President, 2001-2007 has been six years of a politically motivated fight against terrorism. The only thing we have seen in these six years is the quest for a policy response to every measure taken. What I cannot make out, however, is an approach with regard to the development of European counter-terrorism policy in a global context. What role are we playing? What role do we want to play worldwide? Do we have an underlying plan? To date, I have seen no plan or paper, either from the Commission or the Council – or, incidentally, from any Member State – proposing a short-, medium- and long-term counter-terrorism strategy. We have launched measures with short-term effect, stemming financial flows – which has been excellent. We have launched measures aiming to combat terrorism in the medium term by including biometric data in identity documents – which I, personally, do not consider to be the right approach, but was decided by a political majority. With regard to the long term, I cannot see any progress or movement in the field of development assistance, which can be understood in the sense of security policy. Nor do I see any movement in terms of respect for those cultures in which terrorism can supposedly originate; that is, in terms of our making efforts to live a globalised existence, to coexist decently with each other in a globalised world, rather than going out and trying to communicate our society to the rest of the world. The question, therefore, is: what role will Europe adopt? The response since 11 September 2001 has consisted of manifold actionism: each time there is an attack, the respective governments have endeavoured to reassure the population by launching short-term measures, be it the British vehemence in pushing through data retention in the immediate aftermath of the tragic attacks in London, or Germany’s endeavours to push through online searches. There is a lack of an underlying plan. Infringements of fundamental rights, as in the times of the emergency laws, will not solve the problem alone. If we wish to combat terrorism successfully we must define Europe’s worldwide role in this fight, rather than pursuing national actionism, which is then carried out only in Europe.

Mr President, since several Members addressed me before the vote, I would like to use this opportunity to stress once again that the proposal to include the question of representation for the European Parliament in the Intergovernmental Conference mandate was supported by many Members of this House.

 Mr President, Commissioner, Mr Altmaier, ladies and gentlemen, we have had a very detailed briefing on the VIS, and anything I might add to that would only water down the good things that have already been said. Accordingly, I would like to concentrate on the Prüm Treaty. I agree with my honourable colleague, Mr Herbert Reul, that a sound instrument has been created here. The fact that the data I used to request through the system of official and judicial assistance can now be exchanged digitally makes thoroughly good sense. There is not a great deal to be said on the aim and the idea. I do fear, however, that we are making three cardinal errors – one in the field of internal security, one in the realm of justice and home affairs and one with regard to the third pillar. We believe that speed, per se
, is a virtue. We no longer take time to consider whether certain things are actually working or how they could be improved. As far as the third pillar is concerned, we have heard one or two comments today about transparency and democracy, at least with regard to the involvement of Parliament and its right to receive information. The main point I want to make is this: of course exchanges work well between Germany and Austria. We know that successes have been registered there. But now imagine the situation with 27 Member States. Work out the sheer number of possible combinations, what that will mean in terms of the volume of data exchanges and also what a database has to be able to deliver in this context. We do not know whether it is even technically feasible in its present form. My other point is that data, particularly the likes of fingerprints and DNA data, are stored in the various Member States for different reasons. The United Kingdom, as my honourable colleague Sarah Ludford is probably all too well aware, is currently establishing a database that will eventually cover the entire population. At what point does the exchange of such data become legitimate and workable in these circumstances? Cost is another matter. The Member States still have to foot the bill, although I believe that, at a pinch, parts of the cost could be transferred to the community budget – we would have to see what agreement is reached; I know that Poland, for example, takes a different view. I seem to remember reading a document from the Presidency of the Council, which estimated that Germany would incur costs of around EUR 900 000. This makes me wonder how, in its study, the House of Lords could estimate the cost of the project for Britain at some EUR 35 million. Surely there cannot be such huge differences in the way these figures are assessed! Had we not had such an excellent committee secretariat and such outstanding staff, we should not even have reached page 2 in our assessment of the Prüm Treaty and the accompanying parliamentary opinion. Finally, I have a request to make. You have heard often enough that the procedure has come under heavy fire here. It certainly does not accord with the principle of better lawmaking or with the democratic involvement of a third institution. Let us cooperate properly and reasonably in future rather than proceeding in the way that was done with the Prüm Treaty – even if you do have a formal right to exert pressure on us through the three-month limit. It is not entirely conducive to a good working climate either if a senior civil servant from the Council Presidency, when asked in the Committee on Civil Liberties, Justice and Home Affairs what is happening with the parliamentary amendments on Prüm, replies, ‘Well, if we took them into account at this stage and reopened the package that has been sealed with the Member States, we would never make any progress’. That is no way to cooperate. In all other respects, Mr Altmaier, you know that I hold you in high regard!

 Mr President, meaning well is not the same thing as doing well, or so we say in German, and one very much suspects that this regulation is more the fruit of the desire to have an effect on the masses than an expression of rational policymaking. Yes, of course, roaming charges are excessive, and yes, of course, we can all see that the market has failed to do anything about it, but the only question is as to how I remedy the failure of the market; can it be done by means of machinery to determine and regulate prices, which is what we are creating here, or does it not make much more sense, when we come to future deliberations on the telecommunications package, to make the appropriate adjustments to the directive on market access, so that service providers the length and breadth of Europe are enabled to offer their services in every country, thus generating competition that will bring pressure on prices and push them downwards? The liberalisation of telecoms markets has worked; the national markets show us as much, and that must also be possible at the European level. After all, if you have a headache, the doctor does not cut your head off; instead, he might give you an aspirin or something of the sort. It is measures such as these that we should consider rather than throwing the baby out with the bathwater. This is a regression to the sort of price-regulating machinery that the EU abandoned all of 20 years ago, and I find it lamentable.

 Mr President, various Members, among them Mr Salafranca, have highlighted just how much this report has brought to light, and so Mr Coelho and Mr Fava deserve particular gratitude for the work that they and their committee have put in. It is regrettable that there are many Members – most of them, deplorably, from the Group of the European People’s Party (Christian Democrats) and European Democrats, who are behaving like little boys who want to wear shorts in winter, claiming – despite the snow on the ground outside – that the weather is not cold. It is by such obtuse behaviour that many seek to further obstruct the political work that this committee has done, trying, through misconceived loyalty, to protect those who have, in essence, played a part in helping to abduct people and set up secret prisons. Even if we have not proven this, I do believe that it is something that the evidence has made so plain to see that it is difficult to close one’s eyes to these things having been done or to counter with arguments that they have not. Reference has been made to presumed rights that have to be accorded. I think we have to make it clear, right now, that every human and fundamental right, in whatever state, must be a matter of interest to the European Union.
 Alexander Alvaro (ALDE

Mr President, Mr Gloser, Commissioner, the fact that you have heard the same refrain right across the political groups should, I believe, give you pause for thought. The message is that we do of course need a transatlantic partnership and that we are allies in the fight against terrorism. Not only the refrain, but even the verse was the same across the board, namely that credibility, confidence and transparency are necessary where these issues are concerned. Let us begin with credibility. I still remember very well how, in his last speech in this House, the Commissioner particularly praised the data protection aspects of the agreement. I do not believe that such praise is compatible with the rights that we should have from the point of view of data protection law. Where the transfer of airline passenger data is concerned, there is no duty to provide information, and the individuals concerned have no right to correct the data. What, moreover, has happened to credibility when you call the conversations you are conducting with the United States ‘negotiations’? You are standing with your back to the wall and with a pistol pointing at your chest. The United States is threatening no longer to allow aircraft to land, and none of the European Union’s institutions has the backbone to say that, in all good faith, we shall not allow ourselves to be treated like that. Credibility is undermined by our hearing again and again that Parliament is to be involved. If you are serious about that, then include us around the table and, in so doing, show us that you mean what you say. Turning now to the subject of transparency, which European citizens are aware that, when they board an aircraft, 34 items of data, including information about what they have to eat and where they sit, are transferred? None do. I have discussed this very question with citizens in a broadcast. No one knows that this is what happens when he or she boards an aircraft. We are on your side, so involve us instead of just fobbing us off.

 Mr President, Madam Federal Chancellor, the European Union’s primary interest lies in protecting the freedom and security of 480 million people. You were right, in the programme for your presidency, to prioritise the area of justice and internal policy and equally right to lay special emphasis on citizens’ rights. Although there are sensible proposals to be found in it, what I would like to have from you is a clear commitment concerning the balance of freedom and security. What, then, is your position on the introduction – already carried out – of biometric identifiers in identity documents, on the retention of data, on the handing over of air travellers’ data and of data relating to financial transactions to the United States, on the creation of European databases and on the Prüm Convention? What we see happening here is the octopus of data management spreading its tentacles ever wider. Will the German Presidency see the conclusion of the negotiations on the Framework Decision on data protection in the third pillar, and hence the restoration of balance to the scales of freedom and security?
 Alexander Alvaro (ALDE

 – (DE)
 Madam President, there are two points in this work programme that I want to say something about; one has to do with basic freedoms and the other with civic participation in the European Union. Reference has frequently been made in this debate to the problem inherent in the lack of any preferences or priorities on the part of the Commission in the field of basic freedoms and third pillar, a problem that we need, firstly, to address as a matter of urgency, before, secondly, establishing the cause of the lack of political will. Reference has been made to the fact that Mr Barroso, at the beginning of this legislative period, set up a working party made up of Commissioners and tasked with addressing the issue of basic freedoms. I find myself wondering what this working party has been up to over the last two years, since no report has been forthcoming. So have they been doing nothing? Drinking coffee? In all seriousness, though, we must, if we are to take this subject seriously, know what is to be discussed in this context. What I find worthy of criticism about this work programme is the fact that – in parallel with the efforts by G6 states to do something about legal migration and by the few states gathered around the Federal Republic of Germany that have launched the Prüm Convention – parallel structures are developing into a third pillar outside the third pillar without the Commission – whose role as guardian of treaties is about more than making laws – intervening or making any kind of forthright public comment. The fact is that, if we are to act on the judicial and police cooperation front, we have to do so within the framework set for us by the Treaties. Since my time is running out, I will conclude with a brief point, which is that, on page 10 of the programme on civic involvement is written, in English, the following – and I quote:  ‘This includes a commitment to listen and to deliver.’
  (DE)
 We have done so. We have handed one million signatures to the Commission and the Council concerning the seat of Parliament. Two-and-a-half months on, we have yet to receive a reply. I believe that, as far as ‘listen and deliver’ is concerned, the ball is now in the Commission’s court.
 Alexander Alvaro (ALDE

 Mr President, may I make just a very brief interjection, since this report is not exactly an unimportant one, and ask just how legitimate a vote is when fewer than half the Members are present for it? I have no desire to waste the House’s time, since the previous President wasted quite enough of it already.
 Alexander Alvaro (ALDE
). 
 – (DE)
 Mr President, I must admit that I see some aspects quite differently from the previous speaker, but Mr Cashman and I have a relationship of friendly disagreement, and it actually works quite well. Nonetheless, I think it most regrettable that the Council is no longer present, as it is clear from the speech on its behalf that neither was it present at the negotiations nor does it know the substance of this agreement. It is not possible to speak of any gain in data protection if we have adopted the same amount in this regard as before, namely nothing – as twice nothing is still nothing. We still do not know where the data retrieved will end up. We do not know which authority in the United States has access to them, and thus where they will be stored in the end, let alone where they will be transmitted. We do not know when they will be deleted. European citizens are not entitled to enquire where these data are. They are not entitled to require that the data be corrected. It is not true, therefore, that we have achieved more in essence. I am not accusing the Commissioner personally, as I know the pressure the United States has exerted, but I should have liked us to have put up more resistance to this pressure and, for example, taken up my colleague Mr Cavada’s suggestion in saying that, if the US expects data from us, it has to hand its own over too. Who says there cannot be any threat to the EU from the USA? Who says that we do not also have the right to learn who is travelling into our territory? We must be able to pay the US back in the same coin in this case instead of just yielding to its pressure.
 Alexander Alvaro (ALDE

 – (DE)
 Mr President, this is a difficult thing for me to say, but Mr Schulz is absolutely right in everything he has said. I do not think I have ever said that in this House before, and it does not seem likely that I will ever do it again, but he has spelled out where the problem lies, namely in balancing the sovereignty of the Member States against the Union’s capacity to act. How much are the Member States prepared to concede, and how much capacity to act do they want the EU to have? This is aptly reflected in the saying to the effect that the spirit is willing, but the flesh weak. Perhaps, in this instance, it will be the German Presidency of the Council that will send out the signal that moves the European Union further ahead, but I have to say that I would like to see Finland and Portugal acting as particle accelerators, for Germany, although large, is sluggish; it is comparable with France in being a country with great traditions, but not much in the way of speed. Like an oil tanker, it is slow and unmanoeuvrable, and less innovative than countries like Finland where these matters are concerned, and so I ask that you help the German Presidency of the Council to make it easier to weigh up where the fundamental key issues are. On the subject of immigration, Günther Beckstein, the Bavarian Interior Minister, made a disastrous error when he claimed that it would not be too much to expect Spain to take in 25 000 people, for what matters is not whether or not it is reasonable that they should be expected; the real point is that the fate of people – people in desperate need – waiting offshore, is at stake. As far as migration in search of work is concerned, the German Federal Interior Minister, Wolfgang Schäuble, made it abundantly clear that legal migration cannot be considered in isolation from the labour market, so we know that nothing is happening on that front either, and, as for the Human Rights Agency that is so important to you, what the German Federal Chancellor, Angela Merkel, had to say about that was, in effect, ‘well, yes, all right, if we do not have any choice in the matter, but why do we have to have an agency to watch over our own fundamental rights?’ You can see, then, where the problem lies, so I ask you to put your particle-accelerating skills to use; you can enable Germany to make a good job of its term in the Council Presidency. At the moment, it is a prospect that fills me with foreboding.
 Alexander Alvaro (ALDE

 Mr President, I believe that the Council – which is not present, even though the Vice-President is here to represent the Commission – will eventually be aware that this House, all of whose groups have joined together to speak with one voice, certainly does – albeit to varying degrees – see the need for negotiations between us and the United States, as equals, on arrangements relating to data protection, and indeed demands that such negotiations should take place. That should give the other institutions something to think about. The ruling by the European Court of Justice has not got us much further. While it does tell us that we chose the wrong legal basis, it does not tell us how we could have made a better job of it, although that, indeed, is not what the Court is there to do; it is for us to take care how we go about doing things. I would like to say something about the things we need to do in order to put this into practice. I think we are going to end up in a whole load of difficulties if we carry on as we are doing. For a start, and quite apart from the fact that we would rather do this at the European level, rather than having the nation states doing it each off their own bat, I would like to express my doubt as to whether we really do have the legal power to do it. I have to say, quite honestly, that I am not sure about this. Even if we do, the question arises of whether we can do it within the time allowed for implementation. If we in fact do opt for either the third pillar or a combination of second and third pillar as a means of moving this process on, we will meet with problems of implementation, in most Member States at any rate. We will have problems with their constitutions; I can say that in the case of Germany, and I am sure that most of the Member States will find further obstacles in terms of their constitutional law when it comes to implementing this agreement, and so it is in the individual Member States that the necessary conditions must be put in place first of all. There will also be problems relating to the laws on the protection of data, since the European Union – with the exception of the first pillar – has no really effective means of data protection, which means that it is the Member States who will have to prepare the ground where data protection and the legislative process are concerned. What I fear, then, is that the entry into force will be delayed for a bit by quite a few cases brought either before the European Court of Human Rights or the ECJ itself – provided that that is a legal possibility, which will depend on the legal position – or before the national constitutional courts, and so we should, leaving considerations of substance to one side for the moment, apply the greatest of care when dealing with the formal aspects in order to save ourselves further embarrassment of the kind that we cannot afford on the international stage, and certainly not in relation to this issue. By way of conclusion, one has to consider the economic damage that would ensue if the United States were to threaten to prevent our airlines from landing there if we did not sign this agreement, and I would also like to ask why nobody within the European Union has ventured to remind our trans-Atlantic partners of this.

 Mr President, I would like, in particular, to take this opportunity to say how very grateful I am to Mr Bullmann and to Professor Lauk of the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs, who ensured that cooperation with the Committee on Civil Liberties, Justice and Home Affairs was very good and very fruitful, and, at the same time, extend warm thanks to the Council and the Commission, too, for their cooperation. I would also like, speaking on behalf of my group, to reiterate that we, despite the content of this report, will be abstaining when it is voted on, and that the reason for our doing so is that there is a very close connection between the matter we are dealing with and the SWIFT debate that is currently going on. It is particularly because so many people are concerned about interference with fundamental rights and about programmes about which people are not informed that I would have thought it politically well-advised for us to wait and see what comes out of the SWIFT investigation, and I will, for that reason, be recommending to my group that we should abstain. As for the report itself, Mr Lauk and Mr Bullmann have my support, and I wish to thank the two groups for their good cooperation. (Applause)

.  The ALDE group unfortunately feels compelled to abstain from voting on the final vote on this report. ALDE's request to postpone the vote not having been granted, we feel adoption of this report is premature as long as the question marks over the recent SWIFT scandal have not been resolved. The legislative proposal at hand must be adopted on the basis of an international agreement (FATF), to which both the EU and the USA are signatories. The position of the USA must be clarified before the EU should proceed to fulfilling its part of the agreement. Clarification by the ECB and the national central banks is equally precondition for adoption. In view of growing concerns about civil rights and protection of personal data of EU citizens, ALDE feels further assurances are needed in this area. We note that in recent years a host of security measures has been taken, whereas measures to strengthen civil rights and privacy protection have been stalled, and decision making in this area largely takes place without any meaningful parliamentary scrutiny or judicial review. The case of SWIFT casts doubts on the adequacy of data protection instruments in the EU. A fundamental debate must be held first.

 Mr President, the MEPs belonging to the Free Democratic Party have voted against the resolution on the economic and social consequences of business restructuring operations in Europe, being convinced that, in Europe’s market economies, businesses should be free from political pressure in deciding where their production sites should be located. In our single market, competition – including competition between regions – plays a decisive role in terms of the further development of European enterprise and of the way in which it can keep itself fit. The ultimate effect of political pressure is to impede the functioning of the market and it is for that reason that it should not be applied as a means of deterring businesses from acting on their own decisions.

 Mr President, that this is an emotional debate, and is also being conducted in an emotional way, is something I can understand, but I have to say, in all honesty, that I am horrified by the lack of rationality in it. Accusing all these Members of being motivated by pure anti-Americanism, accusing others of having an ideological barrier in their heads, is to act like children in a sandpit squabbling over their buckets and spades. We need to get beyond that stage if we want to be able to produce a balanced and rational report. I can understand why some, for political reasons, might not share the view put across by the committee, and I can also understand why others might find the failure to share that view something worthy of scorn. On this occasion, of course, we have done no more than assemble circumstantial evidence rather than watertight proof, quite simply because no head of a secret service is going to come out and say, ‘Yes, of course, that’s how we did it. We abducted people illegally.’ There are people in this House who would probably not notice that they had been illegally abducted if they had been confined to an aircraft, been blindfolded and taken away, but that is irrelevant. There are many legal systems in which circumstantial evidence can be used as the basis of a trial, and there is circumstantial evidence that is so weighty that it virtually constitutes proof. This is a situation we have found ourselves in in a number of cases. Not everything will turn out to be the way some people, with their conspiracy theories, imagine it to be, but nor is the world as pink and pretty as those imagine who maintain that these things never happened at all, and so this committee has done valuable work in bringing to light at least the tip of an iceberg, for if we want to win the war on terrorism, we can do so only if we are credible, and we can be credible only if we keep to the rules that we lay down to others. What I would like to see, then, is for this committee to carry on doing what it is doing and come to an objective conclusion. I would, by the way, like to say something to the members of the Group of the European People’s Party (Christian Democrats) and European Democrats: your counterparts in the Council of Europe voted to endorse Mr Marty's report, which, as we have just heard, goes even further than the report before this House, and so I find myself wondering how you will be able to justify it if you decide not to vote in favour of this one.

Mr President, I have exercised the right to sit nearer the front so that you do not have to keep looking up to the back rows, and it might make the debates in this House more lively if we moved closer together. After all, we want to ensure that we engage in proper parliamentary deliberation. I do not think I need dwell any longer on this technical point. Commissioner McCreevy explained very well what is essentially at stake here. He pointed out that we have an international obligation to fulfil Special Recommendation VII of the Financial Action Task Force. He has dealt with the technical details, and for that reason I need hardly reiterate these. As he quite rightly said, we have achieved a balanced and reasonable compromise with the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs in collaboration with the Commission and the Council, a compromise which, as I see it and in the view of my committee, takes full account of the interests of data protection and data security as well as meeting the concerns of the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs. Nevertheless, in the case of such reports, even those that come from international bodies, we should ask ourselves far more frequently whether they actually achieve anything. As this document has been on the table since last year and its existence has been common knowledge since some time around November 2005, I took the liberty of taking it with me on a trip to Israel, where I had talks with an expert at a university who specialises in the study of countermeasures to freeze the flow of funds to terrorists. He used to be an agent and a lieutenant in the Israeli armed forces and had worked for Mossad. He looked at this document and, to be perfectly honest, did not really see the value of it. I can quite understand his reaction. My own background is as follows: I have worked in a bank, and I have studied law. I know that terrorist funding does not involve Terrorist A going into a high street bank, depositing his money and hoping that someone will draw it from a bank based in Damascus. There are completely different ways of channelling funds to terrorists. We are perhaps closing a window of opportunity, and we shall no doubt catch some small fry as a result – so much seems certain – but it is not the proper sharp instrument we need to combat terrorism. I am honestly convinced of that. I naturally believe it is right and reasonable to try to curb and dry up the flow of funding to terrorists. That is an absolute must. There might be other ways to achieve that goal. The fact is, however, that instead of standing here I would probably be going up to receive the Nobel Prize if I knew exactly how to do it. Things being as they are, I believe we have at least a good starting point here. For all that, we have engaged in lengthy discussions. We have spoken about this report with many different institutions, including the European Central Bank. With regard to our talks with the ECB, it was hugely disappointing to learn from the press that the ECB had long been aware of the system for which we are now creating a legal basis and which has been publicised in the media and that the ECB knew what SWIFT was doing with the United States. I am not trying to link two issues here, but it is surely obvious that what we are doing here is rubber-stamping a fait accompli
 by creating a system after the event and putting it on a legal basis. It would have been very helpful – and this is not addressed to the Commission, because the fault does not lie with it – if an institution like the ECB had said ‘We know that such things are happening, and we want to cooperate with you to develop a sound legal basis on which to create provisions that protect the fundamental rights of our population, particularly in relation to the United States’. The United States is, of course, a transatlantic partner of ours. I would never question that, particularly as a German. Yet we are starting to think things over. It is not only the recent disclosure of events in connection with SWIFT. There was also the issue of storing aircraft passengers’ personal data, we suspected the existence of secret prisons, there were secret flights, and we had the discussion on data retention. These things are steadily escalating. For precisely this reason, I personally would have inserted a sunset clause – irrespective of the fact that this is an international instrument – so that we could check after five years whether the whole system had achieved anything, whether it had proved useful or whether we had created unnecessary legislation, for that cannot be our function as a parliament. If I call in a painter, I want him to paint the wall properly when he comes. I do not want him to come back twice more to paint some of the bits he has missed. The public have exactly the same expectation of our legislative activity. In this respect, I would like to see the sunset clause stay in place – and I am aware that there has been an agreement on committee procedure – so that we in Parliament have an obligation to review what we are actually doing. Nevertheless, I shall hold discussions with my colleagues from the Group of the European People’s Party (Christian Democrats) and European Democrats and the Socialist Group in the European Parliament to determine our general approach to the subject of SWIFT in the context of transfers of funds. At the end of the day, however, my thanks go to the Commission for cooperating in a spirit of mutual trust, and I would ask whether it might also exert some influence on the European Central Bank to encourage it to cooperate in the same spirit as the Commission itself.

 Mr President, Mr Vice-President, Mrs Roure deserves warm thanks for this report, which has already received deservedly appreciative comments from various Members. As I see it, all the groups have worked together to put together a really outstanding document, not least considering the fact that some of them had been working towards this sort of report and constantly stressing the need for one long before I was elected to this House. The primary reason why this report is so much more urgently needed now than it was before has to do with the information age in which we are now living. It is worth bearing in mind that the total data stored by European authorities amounts, not to hundreds of thousands, or even to millions, but to billions of units of data touching upon the personality of every individual, in that the information stored could, with ill intent – which I am not, however, ascribing to any state – be brought together to compile profiles in order to find out what those citizens we disapprove of are getting up to. This report is made all the more urgently necessary by the prospect of these quantities of data increasing still further. Systems such as EURODAC and APIS exist already, but are yet to be implemented, and the visa information system is in the course of being developed. SIS – the second-generation Schengen information system – is in place, and there may well soon also be, in the third pillar, the storage and transfer of information on air passengers, and so these billions of data units will increase still further. To that one must add the Commission communication on interoperability and synergy and enhancing the efficiency of European databases, the effect of which in practice will be to connect these databases with one another, so that – once the technical problems have been overcome – the exchange of data will be made much simpler. The problem is, though, that the people who want to protect this data, are often depicted as a bunch of crackpots who are incapable of rationally balancing fundamental rights against the right to security. Thank heaven this House has not, in this instance, allowed itself to be pushed into this sort of corner and forced to play off fundamental rights against security, for what definitely does endanger public security is a reduction in fundamental rights. I am very grateful to Mrs Roure for saving us Liberals a great deal of work by incorporating an incredible number of amendments and proposals that originated from Peter Hustinx, the European Data Protection Commissioner, so that means that we are in full agreement. This House has but few swords to hand, and I think Mrs Roure has realised that, but the willingness, if need be, to halt the progress of SIS and VIS shows just how important this report is.

 Mr President, this is probably the wrong time to discuss the content of this proposal in detail, but I would like to say that I have received hundreds of e-mails – not sent in bulk, but individually written messages – and 58 000 verified signatures from members of the public right across Europe, giving vent to their grave concerns. So much for the alleged great public longing for data retention! The Committee on Citizens’ Freedoms and Rights, Justice and Home Affairs has taken these objections seriously and, by means of its amendments, balanced freedom and security against one another. The accumulated pressure of time does not, however, justify the ways in which some elements are attempting to proceed. If this project matters to the European public and is not meant to be just a favour done for the British Presidency of the Council, then we should proceed with caution, for if we do not, we will be fostering the prejudicial belief that the Council only has to call on Parliament to jump for this House to ask in reply ‘how high?’ Under high-pressure conditions, that is the sort of thing that can happen. It is high pressure that enables nature, over the course of millions of years, to produce the most marvellous diamonds. Put a lemon under high pressure, though, and in no time at all, all that will be left is juice and pulp. Whether this House is to be a diamond or a lemon depends on us, so, in order that it may remain a diamond, I ask you to join with me in endorsing the amendments tabled by your committee. (Applause)

 Mr President, Commissioner, Mr Clarke, I am glad of your presence here, and also of that of the distinguished colleagues with whom I have had the privilege of working for over a year. You cannot, however, expect me to be jumping for joy, since the line I take differs from the one you have just put forward. For a start, I do not believe that we ever really had a decision to take on which legal basis was actually being considered, for that is obvious; there are treaties that spell it out in black and white. Moreover, the Commission also brought in a proposal, under Article 95, for a directive that would have required codecision by this House. To celebrate getting something that is rightfully ours is something I regard as derogatory to the dignity of this House, but, fair enough, I dare say that others take a different view. Speaking personally, I believe that we knew perfectly well what we were letting ourselves in for, and we know from the legal services – including the Council’s own – that the Council would not have been well advised to take a decision. We also know that there was no unanimity at Council level, and so it made perfectly good tactical sense for unanimity to be established here in this House. I also wish to dispute much of the substance of what you said. The decisions we took in Committee were taken together, without regard to party allegiances, and sometimes unanimously, and the amendments we drafted were excellent. A final vote of 33 to 8 with 5 abstentions accurately reflects the position taken by the second-largest committee of this House, and the only one of its constituent bodies to take a decision on the matter. I take a different view where the time limits for storage are concerned, but you know that. I have travelled a much greater distance and have gone a long way in reaching these compromises, to which we in the Committee have agreed, in order to show some sort of backbone. Now, along comes this Article X, which makes provision for the Member States to extend the time limits for storage for as long as they like, provided that they inform the Commission and give it the opportunity to spend six months assessing whether their doing so could result in barriers to trade or disruption to the internal market – interestingly enough, not whether there might be any objections of a legal nature or from the point of view of fundamental rights. One result of this is that Poland, the Federal Republic of Germany’s much-valued neighbour, has plans to retain data for 15 years. What an interesting idea! We have not, however, managed to come to any agreement about the costs involved. The fact that the companies and the public have to foot the bill for what the states order sets a precedent. I do indeed note the inclusion of provisions on the protection of data and of the public, as well as of sanction mechanisms, but, much as I welcome these positive steps, they require the Council to do no more than snap its fingers, since they refer to national legislation – which, as you must surely be aware, is not difficult to implement. As regards content, we also consulted with the Commission, which took a similar line to our own, and came to the conclusion that:  ‘It is quite clear that the text is divergent from our original proposal in a number of important areas. While the adoption of our proposal would have resulted in almost complete harmonisation in this area, the compromise text represents only a partial harmonisation.’  (DE)
 As we have not resolved the issue of the retention of data once and for all, which is what the Committee and the Commission had had in mind, I do wonder to what degree we can call this an outright success. What we have done is to hand over to the Member States a measure that Directive 2002/58 did not empower them to implement. Precisely what shape it takes is now largely for them to decide, since we have provided for an enormous degree of flexibility. I do not believe that, in so doing, we can justifiably claim to have acted as European legislators. I also believe that there are continuing misunderstandings as to this House’s competence and future powers. A press communiqué dated 8 December from the Socialist Group ends with the following sentence:  In future all dossiers in this area will be treated on the basis of codecison with Parliament, including the revision of the present directive.  (DE) 
In the latter case, that is certainly true, but the idea that, in future, everything serving to combat terrorism will be dealt with in accordance with a codecision procedure, is something I find highly doubtful, since this is an area in which the Council’s decisions must be unanimous. I also know that Ireland will take any decision we make here on appeal to the European Court of Justice, and will raise the question of whether this is possible in terms of competence; this is a very interesting turn of events. I would like, finally, to tell you that I am very disappointed with the way the procedure has gone and with the contributions made by the two big groups. I regard as in unbelievably bad taste the manner in which they behaved after we had spent eight weeks discussing these matters in great depth and considering our next steps, with everyone having given some ground, an enormous number of compromises having been made, and the Committee having come to a very clear and definite decision. I think it was in bad taste for a handful of members of the big groups to prejudice in this way a compromise proposal that the Council had not yet officially produced, there having been as yet no official negotiation with the Council on the grounds that the Council representative had, in principle, negated his own mandate and believed himself unable to negotiate! It is true to say that I am disappointed, but I look forward with very eager anticipation to tomorrow’s vote and, all things considered, will say that the willingness to work together in a rational manner will always be there. Not everyone has to find the results to their liking. (Applause)

Mr President, Commissioner, Mr de Vries, ladies and gentlemen, Mr Duquesne has already given a detailed explanation of the need for action to curb, combat and prevent terrorism in Europe and throughout the world. In the context of the reports on the table, and particularly the one for which I am responsible, the report on the retention of data, I should like to remind the House of what the European Court of Justice has said with regard to the war on terrorism, namely that governments must constantly consider whether all the resources they deploy and all the measures they enact, however legitimate they may be, are not actually endangering what they are intended to protect. In some cases, this may be the existence of a free society; in others it may be the right of personal privacy. I heartily agree with the shadow rapporteurs, and I should like to take this opportunity to express my thanks to them, that we are not fundamentally opposed to the proposals made by the governments of the United Kingdom, Ireland, France and Sweden. We would certainly insist, however, that measures involving significant curtailments of fundamental rights, which – as all law students learn in the first term at every European university – must always be properly justified, are based on a needs assessment which endorses the measures in question. This assessment should not be confined to identifying the need for action but should also outline the benefits of retaining, as a matter of course, data from public telecommunications networks – the Internet, landlines, mobile phones and SMS – which could relate to any of 450 million people. The main problem I should like to re-examine in this context is that of the procedural method. I am grateful for the communication we have received. With the best will in the world, however, I have to say that the procedure leaves a great deal of scope for improvement. The report on which you will vote today is based on a draft dating from April of last year. In the meantime, the Council’s proposal has undergone several amendments. The most recent proposal dates from 24 May. Since then the Commission has taken the initiative to introduce its own proposals. Since Parliament is not up to date on these, not having been involved in the latest discussions to the extent of receiving a new document through official channels, we can scarcely be expected to express unbounded enthusiasm about the cooperation of the other institutions in this matter. Perhaps some thought should be given to ways of improving interinstitutional cooperation if we want to succeed in combating terrorism. To deal briefly with the report itself, in the old version – and similar problems may well exist in the new version too – we identified technical defects with regard to the means of enforcement. It is a matter of creating databases designed to store as much data as it is possible and necessary to retain; it is a matter of ascertaining how easily ways can be found to circumvent the provisions contained in the present proposal and how easy or difficult it may and must be for the relevant industry to effect the requisite structural changes – and this is the economic crux of the matter – without the need for compensation. Perhaps some of the new proposals set out different rules on this last point, but there was certainly no provision for compensation in the version on which we had to base our deliberations. The other question we had to examine was a legal one: to what extent is the proposed system compatible with the right to respect for private and family life as defined in Article 8 of the European Convention on Human Rights? To what extent is it compatible with the fundamental rights enshrined in our national constitutions, such as the right to determine the disclosure and use of one’s own personal data, as in Germany, and the right of telephone privacy, which presumably exists in every Member State, to store the data of all European citizens? In which country will the framework decision first be declared unconstitutional, if it is adopted at all? Another aspect is the political message conveyed in the justification of the first document, which states that the system should be deliberately designed to include those who have never come under suspicion so that it can achieve the goal of combating terrorism and organised crime as comprehensively and efficiently as possible. Perhaps an alternative solution could be sought among the other available options. We have the Convention on Cybercrime, which proposes ways of striking a reasonable balance between the storage and protection of data, such as the use of a data freeze or a system of data preservation. This Convention proposes several solutions that have not yet been implemented in a single country. At this point one begins to wonder whether the desire to take rapid action did not triumph over rational reflection in this case, particularly in view of the fact that the Council received its mandate on 25 March of last year, exactly two weeks after the dreadful atrocities in Madrid. I hope that the message we are sending out from here will be properly interpreted. We are willing to cooperate, but we also want the right procedure to be chosen. As the report shows, we believe, and the legal services believe, that this matter should be part of the first pillar of the EU Treaty, in other words one of the areas in which our Parliament engages in joint decision-making and is not merely consulted. Perhaps that can be taken on board, and perhaps we shall then be accorded the same level of respect that we give the other institutions in the course of our work.

 Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, Mr Cavada was quite right to raise just now the issue of Parliament’s involvement, and I think we should give more thought to our approach in such a sensitive area as this one. Particularly as we are discussing the area of freedom, security and justice, I would like to focus on the planned proposal on data retention. The Committee on Civil Liberties, Justice and Home Affairs – and I, as its rapporteur – had doubts about the legal basis for this proposal, and in this the Committee on Legal Affairs, the Commission and the Council’s Legal Service agreed with us. I would now just like to know whether we can assume that the Council will do likewise and involve Parliament in the decision on this matter, or whether we can take it as read that the Member States will stick with their proposal in the full knowledge that they are setting themselves against three institutions. I would be very interested to learn that as a matter of extreme urgency.

 Mr President, since many good things have already been said, it is not necessary for me to report on everything. The ALDE Group welcomes Mrs Buitenweg’s report on the proposal for a Council framework decision on criminal judicial cooperation. Procedural safeguards are an indispensable supplement in an area where cooperation between Member States’ judicial and law enforcement agencies is ever closer. We believe that while the mutual recognition of decisions necessitates trust between Member States, it is equally important that suspects affected enjoy equivalent rights. I must admit that as a new Member of this Parliament it was quite frightening to hear that in the European Union this was not the case in the past. But it is now satisfactorily regulated that suspects have the same rights throughout Europe; so I am very happy that this framework decision is now on the table. The ALDE Group had certain ideas in relation to this proposal. First of all we proposed establishing a register of specialised qualified interpreters and an interpretation hotline. We wanted to guarantee the rights of disabled people and psychological assistance. We wanted the Letter of Rights to be made accessible to the disabled, the inclusion of victims’ rights and the setting-up of an independent body of experienced, independent and properly remunerated lawyers. We are very happy that the rapporteur has taken most of these ideas on board. This is a very good outcome and that is why we support the rapporteur’s original line. We aim to give equal rights to suspects regardless of the type of suspicion they are under. We aim for equal protection and for harmonisation. Finally, I am very satisfied that the majority of the Committee on Civil Liberties, Justice and Home Affairs supported our amendments, which were aimed at giving equal rights to the disabled and clarified the obligations as regards lawyers and interpreters. Mrs Buitenweg, the ALDE Group will support you and your report.

 Mr President, I wish to thank Commissioner Frattini for attending this debate tonight, which is the first on data protection during this parliamentary term, on the initiative of my own Group, the Alliance of Liberals and Democrats for Europe. This is not the first time that Parliament has examined the issue of PNR, but it is almost two years to the day since Parliament first raised this issue. Tonight’s debate is therefore intended to take stock of what has happened since then. I have been appointed rapporteur on the initiative by four Member States relating to data retention. That is why some months ago we tabled two oral questions on the issue of PNR and the issue of data retention, with a view to having a public debate on two issues that raise serious concerns from the point of view of fundamental human rights, and to get more information from the Commission on these issues. Commissioner Frattini, we were pleased to hear during the EP hearings of candidate Commissioners that you attach a great deal of importance to defending fundamental rights, and I know that you are personally committed to defending citizens’ privacy. We appreciate that stance, but also want the Commission to bring forward the proposals on data protection under the third pillar that we have been promised for so long. The European Parliament finds itself in quite a conflictual situation vis-à-vis other EU institutions. We have strongly disagreed with the Commission and Council on the PNR issue, challenging their decisions before the Court of Justice, but unfortunately will have to wait a long time before the Court issues its decision. On the data retention issue, I am unconvinced by the four Member States’ initiative, with regard both to the content and the legal basis. I know that the Commission shares these doubts. In general terms, the European Parliament is extremely worried about the compliance of these provisions with international and European human rights norms, such as the European Convention on Human Rights, and the related jurisprudence, as well as with EU law. That is why we are here tonight. On the issue of data retention, we know the Commission has raised the scrutiny reservation on the correctness of the legal basis of the four Member States’ proposal. The Commission believes that a third pillar basis is not correct, and that a first pillar basis would be the right one. We would be keen to view the Commission’s legal responding, since I have the same doubts and have requested Parliament’s legal service to make the same legal check. However, we also have doubts on the necessity and proportionality of European data retention provisions. That is why we would ask the Commission whether it supports the four Member States’ initiative not only in terms of the legal basis but also in terms of the content. Secondly, we would like to know whether the Commission will ask the four Member States to withdraw their initiative, a move the Commission has not yet made. We would also like to know if and when the Commission will propose a first pillar instrument. The Commission 2005 working programme schedules for this month the adoption by the Commission of a directive on the retention of data for law enforcement purposes. Will this deadline be respected and what will the content of the proposal be? Thirdly, we would like an update on the long-overdue third pillar data protection instrument that Commissioner Frattini personally promised would be brought forward. Let me underline that the Article 29 Working Party has already drafted a proposal for harmonised data protection principles for the third pillar. We would be honoured to hear your remarks on this issue. On the PNR issue, Parliament has a keen interest and a right to have an update on the current action before the Court of Justice, with Parliament objecting to the signing of the international agreement of 28 May 2004 that makes the transfer of air passenger data to the US possible. First of all, Parliament has consistently requested the development of a push system, most recently in the amendment adopted to the 2005 budget. Can the Commission inform Parliament whether there have been any developments? With a view to the protection of the privacy of European air passengers, could the Commission inform Parliament of the volume of passenger data which the authorities have access to and whether there is an effective filtering of sensitive data. Also, are intra-European flights excluded? The Commission has published a communication on a global EU approach on PNR. However, the Commission is evidently not following a coherent approach, since on the one hand it has not finalised the international agreement with Australia, while on the other hand it is ready to negotiate with Canada on standards that are entirely different from those which apply to the US. Will the Commission follow up on the communication and will it start adhering to a truly global EU approach? Finally, why has Parliament never been informed about the negotiations on PNR at an ICAO level? The current practice is not democratic, transparent or justifiable. Thank you, and I look forward to hearing your answers.

 Mr President, even though Iran is one of the largest countries on earth, it still has a government whose actions we view with concern. I am delighted to learn of the efforts being made to foster dialogue with it, and of the pressure that the European Union is exerting in connection with the state of human rights there. During the fourth dialogue on human rights between the EU and Iran, held on 14 and 15 June 2004 in Teheran, Iran undertook to improve human rights, and that is a good thing, but we can also see that there is an urgent need that something be done about this, for international organisations estimate that every year still sees between 300 and 400 executions carried out, with some 80 people being flogged and an unknown number stoned to death – all this despite, as you have heard, these things no longer, officially, being in the Iranian penal code. What shows how much contempt a government can have for its own people is the relevant article – no. 119 – from the former Iranian penal code, according to which the stones used at a stoning must not be so large that the condemned person dies from the impact of one or two of them, nor so small that they cannot be described as stones. Such a thing is torture, legitimised by the state with the intention of causing death, and it has yet to be demonstrated that it is no longer carried out today, at this stage in the twenty-first century. Reference has also been made to the human rights of juveniles; although death sentences are pronounced on them, the sentence is not carried out until they are 18. That means that minors aged 14 and over can spend up to four years in what are called ‘education camps’, waiting to be executed, instead of being able to have a proper education and a future to look forward to. We have just heard what the UN has had to say on the situation in Iran. I am very glad that the letter sent by the President of this Parliament, Josep Borrell, to the Iranian ambassador has helped to get a stoning, due to be carried out at the end of last year, delayed and the sentence commuted. Let us continue to exert this sort of pressure, for only in that way will we, in the eyes of the world, do justice to our own objectives.

 Mr President, I am particularly keen to pick up on Mrs Lambert’s comments on transition periods. We should do our best to avoid perpetuating the absurd situation whereby third-country nationals are invited to work in the European Union or in the European labour market whilst restrictions on employment opportunities for those from EU Member States are still in place. A balance of some kind must be found, and I am confident that this will become possible in the course of further work on the matter. I would however like to thank Commissioner Frattini and his staff for their efforts in continuing work on this issue, above all because employment is by far the best form of integration we can offer our citizens, as has been brought to my attention in many conversations with groups and individuals affected. On a slightly different note, I have noticed that the Green Paper is littered with a great many questions. Given that the issue of labour migration is such a complex one, it would perhaps be better to leave some of these to one side, in line with the principle of ‘keep it simple, stupid’.

 Mr President, Mr President of the Commission, ladies and gentlemen, it is by no means easy to deliver an appreciation of the Commission’s strategic policy objectives in two and a half minutes, but, as we are in such festive spirits, I do have this to say on the subject. Let us imagine the Commission as Santa Claus and me as a little boy. I will have to give some more thought to the role to be played by the Council, and will leave you to imagine it as Rudolf or as Santa’s little helpers. I now have the difficult task of drawing up my wish list, and top of the list is that I, along with all other MEPs, should no longer be denied the right of codecision in matters of justice and home affairs. This is an important field for the EU, and one in which this House expects, from 2005, to be fully involved, for our European society is founded upon the rule of law, and every citizen allows himself to be guided by the standards set by the Community, believing as he does that these have been examined and approved by the majority of his legitimate representatives. My wish is that that belief should become reality. My second wish is that we should all play by the same rules – rules that we have made for ourselves. I think we can no longer tolerate the situation in which national governments, in love with their own grandeur, circumvent the institutions they created. When a handful of European interior ministers take decisions as a clique, they treat European democracy with contempt. Both Tampere and the Hague Programme are good examples of a Community approach that involves everyone. My wish is that we should press on with this open dialogue instead of forming ourselves into small clubs. My third wish is that due account be taken of the need for data protection. It is time that the third pillar included an instrument comparable to Directive 95/46/EC on data protection. I would like Commissioner Frattini to remember that he has indicated his agreement to this. My fourth wish – and my last for today – is that the European Union should face terrorism head-on, and that it should show that democracy also means the defence of democracy. The European Union must demonstrate that it is more than equal to those who seek to send freedom up in flames. A victory for terrorism means the destruction of free society, and that is something we must neither aid nor abet. I would like to see the Commission valuing and maintaining fundamental democratic principles, the freedom of the individual, and giving due weight to data protection. Most of the wish lists I have seen and heard so far are not as short as that, but for all those who wrote them they are expressions of hope. My hope is that what I want for Christmas will not be buried under a snowdrift thrown up by political aberrations.

 Mr President, while working in my electoral district at the weekend, I was told that, following a court ruling in Iran, another woman is expected to be stoned to death in three weeks’ time. As this information came too late for a motion for urgent procedure, I would now ask the House to examine this case and, if need be, to take action against Iran. I do not believe that this House, let alone the European Union, can tolerate actions of this kind on the part of states. I therefore ask you, as a matter of urgency, to determine whether a young woman is indeed expecting to be stoned to death in Iran in three weeks’ time, and to intervene in so far as you are able should this prove to be the case.

 Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, Commissioner, I am delighted that you are still here at this late hour. I should firstly like to thank Mr Coelho for his report on the Council’s proposal to include biometric data in identity documents, which from a liberal point of view was on the whole balanced and justifiably critical. I believe that Mr Coelho, in his report, made reference, without hesitation and with the necessary clarity, to the issues that remain unclear, whether these issues involved the guarantee of data protection or the remaining uncertainties with regard to the technical procedures for storing the data on the identity documents. Further to Mr Coelho’s comments, I wonder why it has not again been clarified as to which costs will be incurred by the inclusion of biometric data in identity documents, before the Council presses forward and takes a decision? The question must also be asked as to whether this is financially responsible. I am, however, seriously annoyed, as the lack of clarity over some of the contents leaves me no option but to ask myself how much attention the Council really pays to such a serious issue. I am not necessarily talking about technical issues. In this connection, I have to ask myself – and this is something that was referred to by Mr Cashman – how the Council defines its relationship with Parliament. After the relevant committee issued its opinion on the proposal, the Council presented us with an amended proposal, with amendments which were clearly more than merely editorial or cosmetic changes. The original Council proposal provided, as mentioned by Mr Frattini, for the mandatory integration of a biometric feature in EU citizens’ identity documents, with the way in which this was to be implemented being at the Member States’ discretion. The new proposal we have before us is quite different. This gives rise to two questions, to which I would ask the Council to respond; why have these amendments been made after the relevant committee had discussed the proposal? The Commissioner’s answer implied that the subsidiarity principle was being circumvented here, as a number of Member States had no interest in implementing the proposal. The other question – and I know that my time is nearly up, but I have one more question I should like answered – is: what kind of way is this to act? Parliament is being threatened with ...

 Mr President, just a very brief word to Mr Schulz: please bring the statement you have just made to the attention of the German Minister for the Interior. That would seem to be urgently needed. On 4 and 5 November this year, the European Council laid down its priorities for the further development of the area of freedom, security and justice. It is probable that these developments will do more to shape the EU’s character than any previous joint initiative, for it is on the realisation of this Union governed by the rule of law that a common European community will be founded. The character of our society will be determined not only by to what extent the European Union wants our 450 million citizens to be protected against the dangers of terrorism, among other things, or the degree to which it wants judicial cooperation to be organised in future practice, but also by joint action in the areas of asylum, immigration and integration. We must not forget that the foundations we will be laying down over the coming five years will determine not only the futures of 450 million people, but also those of their children and grandchildren. I would just like to take this opportunity not merely to remind you, but also perhaps to make you again aware, of the responsibility we all took on when we made the decision to be policymakers in this House. We shape societies and fashion their futures; it is, alas, only in retrospect that we will learn whether our efforts are crowned with success. We will then, however, have to answer our children’s questions, as our parents and grandparents had to answer our own, and I will be able to tell them that I did indeed prevent freedom being sacrificed to security, that I did indeed help to keep this great society open, tolerant and free, a society that would never tolerate intolerance, that I did indeed offer those persecuted in foreign lands the opportunity to seek safety in this Europe of ours, and gave that same opportunity to those who wanted to live and work here. And when my children ask me how I achieved that, I hope I will be able to tell them how we, the citizens’ directly elected representatives, would not stand for the interior ministers of a few countries joining together in what they called ‘G5’ and taking essential decisions without reference to Parliament. We have seen how important it is to integrate the foreigners living in Europe, in a way which respects them and likewise demands that they respect it. I will tell them how we overcame those who sought to burn a free society to the ground, how we, in fighting terrorism, always took account of the need to preserve citizens’ rights and freedoms. Such measures as biometric data in identity documents are to be assessed most stringently by reference to their necessity and proportionality. I will tell them how we stamped out every form of traffic in human beings, which was slavery in a modern guise, combating it at every level and making it possible for people to enter Europe legally, and how we discharged our obligations to those who seek asylum, without making it easy for ourselves by shifting our responsibility to states beyond our borders and without our laws. I will tell them that we did not merely create empty institutions, but such bodies as the European Human Rights Agency, endowed with funding and a mandate. The Hague Programme is a beginning; it is certainly not an end. Before we make irreversible changes to our society, we must think, discuss and argue, and do it time and time again. For it is the protection of human and civil rights, of freedom and security, that underpins this Europe of ours, which we must defend – even, and something particularly, within its own institutions.

 Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, in ruling that patients have a right to be reimbursed the costs of treatment carried out abroad, the European Court of Justice has given us a clear mission. In this regard, Commissioner Vassiliou, the Commission proposal is excellent. It is a proposal worth standing up for. I regret what has gone on in this House with regard to this directive over the last few weeks. The spectres of the market have been evoked and absurd connections to the Services Directive have been created. Some of the amendments – and I say this as someone who grew up in the former German Democratic Republic – make my blood run cold. One example states that Member States may take appropriate measures to stem patient flows. What manner of people are these? It would seem that new Iron Curtains are to be put up. It is all the more remarkable that such proposals should come from the Group of the Greens/European Free Alliance, of all people. We are talking about social Europe, something that we talk about a lot these days – Members from the Socialist Group in the European Parliament, in particular, like to do so. This lunchtime we have the opportunity to pass this acid test and make it clear whether, for us, this is about patients’ rights or whether we prefer the blinkered perspective of the national healthcare bureaucracies.

 Mr President, Commissioner Verheugen, ladies and gentlemen, I have a few words of warning to say about this compromise, which was achieved very quickly – astonishingly quickly, in fact. We have leapt forward so quickly that we could have adopted this directive tonight practically without debate. That must be one of the reasons why so few Members are planning to speak. I would like to warn that we are extending the scope of this directive at a point in time where we have hardly any experience of how transposal of the current directive has gone. I would also like to remind everyone that we have debated the scope in Parliament, and this House wanted to extend it to cover all products. I think that would be the wrong way to go. It is neither acceptable nor sensible to subject every product produced in the EU to an environmental compliance assessment, and it is regrettable – at least as far as I can see – that this is being included in the text as an option for 2012. I would like to warn that we need to beware that the European Commission does not become a product planning authority. Politicians and administrators do not know better, including after the experiences of the financial and economic crisis, how products should be produced and what engineers can perhaps do better. In closing, I would also like to remind everyone that the growing complexity of this product legislation overwhelms small and medium-sized enterprises. Many of these requirements can hardly be met by these enterprises as it is, and what we are doing today will saddle them with further burdens, the practical consequences of which I have the feeling we have not sufficiently thought out.

 Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, I fundamentally welcome the European Ecolabel. It is right that we should make a new attempt to spread the Community Ecolabel further. I also think it is right that we will be retaining the voluntary nature of the scheme in future. In future, the label scheme will only be implemented where clear criteria and yardsticks apply, which must be met before the Ecolabel may be used. In this regard, I call on the Commission to draw up sensible, clear and comprehensible criteria. The idea of attracting people to the scheme must be at the heart of this. It would be a great shame if the establishment of the Ecolabel were to fail due to bureaucratic obstacles. It will be the consumer, at the end of the day, who decides whether the Ecolabel succeeds or fails, as it is with consumers that the scheme must find acceptance. Attached as I am to the Blue Angel ecolabel that we have in Germany, it must not be a question of personal preference, at the end of the day, but rather it comes down to conveying to consumers at a single glance what specific qualities a product has. There will only be added value for consumers if the Member States do not use their own symbols and there is ultimately a uniform symbol at the European level. A jumble of symbols alienates consumers rather than informing them. One symbol, one conclusion – that is what we should all be working towards together.

 The legal basis used, Article 13(1) of the EC Treaty, is not appropriate considering that, in the opinion of the German Free Democratic Party (FDP), the principle of subsidiarity is not being observed. It is not within the remit of the EU legislator to lay down the regulations in question, thereby seriously encroaching on the self-determination of the Member States.  Combating discrimination of all kinds and bringing about participation in public life by the disabled are important jobs. Proposing to extend the anti-discrimination regulations to practically all areas of life is out of touch with reality, however. The reversal of the burden of proof laid down in the directive will mean that it is possible to open legal proceedings on the basis of accusations not backed up by sufficient evidence. Those affected would then have to pay compensation even if they have not actually committed any acts of discrimination but are unable to prove their innocence. Defined in this sweeping way, this reversal of the burden of proof is therefore questionable from the point of view of its compatibility with acting as a state under the rule of law. It will create uncertainty and facilitate abuse. That cannot be the raison d’être
 of a progressive anti-discrimination policy. A further consideration must be that the Commission is currently pursuing infringement proceedings against numerous Member States in relation to inadequate transposal of the existing European directives on anti-discrimination policy. There is as yet, however, no overview of those regulations that have been transposed so as to make it possible to determine the need for new regulations that has been claimed. Germany, in particular, has already gone far beyond previous stipulations from Brussels. We therefore voted against this report.

 Madam President, Commissioners, ladies and gentlemen, we will shortly be voting on the directive on the prevention of industrial emissions. The Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Food Safety adopted a series of compromises by a large majority. I hope that we can hold that course, as these rules will harmonise the environmental requirements for industrial installations across the EU. Doing so improves the protection of the environment whilst, at the same time, ensuring fair competition. At the heart of the compromises is the European safety network. This concept introduces Community-wide limit values for pollutant emissions by industry. These define clear requirements for the licensing of industrial installations. In order to obtain a permit, they must be better than the specification from the safety network. This approach allows sufficient room to manoeuvre to set individual requirements. What it certainly means, however, is the end of the opportunity to abuse that room to manoeuvre and operate installations with poor emissions ratings via derogations. With the safety network, we will achieve clarity together with the necessary flexibility. There will be absolutely no need for stretchable derogations that are open to interpretation. When I made this proposal, I was accused of being a ‘green activist’. That – and I will put this somewhat carefully – is an exaggeration. This is about improving the implementation of EU rules that have been in force for years. Best available technique – which is what the European safety network is aimed at – should have been standard in all industrial plants in the EU since last autumn, yet that is still far from the reality. Best available technique is currently seeing judicious use in three Member States. Oxides of nitrogen and sulphur are some of the primary issues in industrial environmental pollution. There is potential here for a reduction of 60% to 80% if the best available techniques are consistently applied. Those are the European Environment Agency’s figures. This technique is not science fiction. It is not something from the laboratory, it is not at the laboratory stage, it is available, it is affordable and it works. Despite that, many Member States are saving themselves the effort, because there is good money to be had even in pollution-spewing installations. Some Member States have been simply overlooking the need to invest in modernising their plants for years. That distorts competition and damages the environment and I am therefore arguing for a new approach for the improved implementation of best available techniques. The compromise packages will also reduce expenditure on bureaucracy, which only costs money and does nothing to help the environment. We are therefore linking the number of reports that plant operators have to send to the authorities to the risk posed by their plants and to whether the operators meet the requirements imposed on them. The same applies to inspections by the authorities. Where there may be danger, a closer look should be taken. Where nothing happens, there is no need for constant monitoring. For many in this Chamber, soil protection is a sore point. A constructive debate on this topic is, unfortunately, clearly no longer possible, although it was possible to reach compromises. They reduce the soil status report to the essentials – the status report need not be comprehensive and need not always be carried out. Instead, we are concentrating on the actual risk posed by a given plant. Analyses are required where relevant quantities of hazardous substances are actually handled. Furthermore, the clean-up of sites to their original condition is unrealistic, for which reason the compromise now talks of clean-up to a satisfactory condition. That does not change my own personal view that soil protection is not an area that should be regulated at EU level. It would be better left to the Member States. IPPC affects almost all sectors of industry. That being the case, there has been very intensive lobbying over recent days. In some areas, improvements on the original compromises were actually necessary, one example being in relation to agriculture. The calculation of threshold values for poultry farms is too bureaucratic. Instead of differentiating by species between turkeys, ducks and broiler chickens, we should keep the threshold of 40 000 places for poultry. The production of natural manure, liquid manure and slurry, furthermore, is not something that belongs within the scope of this directive. The subject is relevant, regulation serves a purpose, but please, not in this legal act. A farmer’s field is no industrial plant. Farmers have many more items on their wish lists, and the decision about these two points is appropriate. I therefore went to some lengths to get the agreement of the shadow rapporteurs on this point. The same applies to power generation from waste gases in steel production. This process is very efficient and produces energy from an otherwise useless by-product. The marginal reduction in the emission of pollutants that was desired could only be achieved with a large degree of financial expenditure. This was about keeping things in proportion. I find the behaviour of the Group of the European People’s Party (Christian Democrats) and European Democrats, in pulling out of the compromise and going through the entire report again, scattering amendments everywhere, distressing and regrettable. Such an approach is not constructive. Reaching political decisions requires at least a minimum level of mutual reliance and working together. I can understand that members of the PPE-DE Group might not be completely satisfied with the various compromises. All I can say, in that regard, is that I would have been very happy to have discussed their proposals, but at no time during the compromise negotiations with the shadow rapporteurs were such proposals put forward. Their uncoordinated last-minute actions mean that there is now a danger that exactly the opposite will be achieved – sound and correct proposals are being jeopardised. I would like, at this point, to offer my sincere thanks to the other shadow rapporteurs, in particular, Mr Turmes, Mr Hegyi and Mr Blokland, who were reliable partners in negotiation despite differences in substance. We have an opportunity here, today, to send a signal for both better environmental protection and fair competition. I hope that we will use that opportunity for a plan that is supported by major economic and environmental groups. Please support the compromises! Thank you.

 rapporteur.

 Mr President, I want to keep this short. I would like to offer my thanks for the constructive contributions that I have heard Members make to the debate today. To conclude, I just have a couple more things to say. Firstly, I would like to offer my sincere thanks to the Commissioner for not categorically arguing against the concept of minimum requirements for the safety network. This proposal is no work of the devil, nor is it a bureaucratic monster. It is an instrument for solving problems and one that we should give a chance to. For that reason I would like to take this opportunity just to call for your support for it once again. The other thing I wanted to say I will direct at my British friends, and ‘across all the parties’. My dear British friends, I do understand, Caroline, I can see your problem. I can well understand that the energy security of a country will be put above compliance with an air pollution limit for a certain period of time. I have a lot of sympathy for that. I am also the last person who would fail to grant Her Majesty additional time when it comes to building new coal-fired power stations. This is something that we can talk about. The problem is that that is exactly what we have not done. At no point in the last four months has this conversation taken place. I want to urge you, at this point – looking forward to second reading now – to be open-minded once again and to say ‘let us talk about a compromise now’ and, to that end, to give up the resistance – which, in my view, is completely irrational – and the fundamental opposition to the minimum standards, which is unjustifiable from the point of view of either competition policy or environmental policy. I think that a compromise can be reached on this, something I also hope to see at the end of the second reading. Incidentally, I am not of the view that we should not seek compromises at first reading. This legislation is too complex for that. I do not wish to end this parliamentary term as rapporteur and hand on legislation to the next Parliament where the text of the directive that is debated is inconsistent, illogical and contradictory. I therefore ask for your support for the compromises when we vote in an hour’s time.

 Mr President, I am very pleased that the President has finally given the floor to the rapporteur. I am also quite surprised! At this time, we are still getting used to the recast rules. I would, however, like to draw attention to the fact that the application of these rules is no surprise, even just before a vote. We have already applied these rules consistently in committee and it is only logical for them to be applied consistently in plenary. If we were to vote now, there would not be a single amendment and not a single compromise up for voting that have not been discussed. Everything is itemised on the voting list. For the same reason as Mr Sacconi, but with a different conclusion, I see absolutely no reason to postpone. We can vote now! (Applause)

Madam President, I would like to thank Mr Florenz very much for his report, which, unfortunately, has not been a great success, probably partly as a result of the fact that it has been discussed very much in the shadow of the legislative package on climate change. We must face up to the consequences of climate change; there is no question about that. It is only the means for doing so chosen by the report that I cannot fully support. Firstly, it is right that the EU should take the first steps to protect the climate, but it is not beneficial to rush on ahead alone without the involvement of partners. Europe leading the way is not enough to convince the rest of the world. A more viable approach must involve the industrial nations and at least China, India and Brazil, otherwise Europe’s economy will remain unfairly burdened without there being any measureable effects on global CO2
 emissions. Secondly, with our current level of knowledge, renewable energies cannot completely replace fossil energy sources. It may be motivating on a political level to demand that, but it is not realistic. The political will, as great as that may be, will not nullify any physical laws. Thirdly, biofuels are hailed as environmentally-friendly alternatives. Their negative side effects on food prices, which are rising as a result of these biofuels, and rainforests, which are being deforested, are not as yet under control. Fourthly, a means of mobility that protects resources in the long term is a reasonable goal. Providing incentives may help to achieve this goal. However, we should consider at what point state intervention is going too far and at what stage we can claim to have knowledge that we do not have today. No one currently knows which technologies will best meet the mobility needs of individuals in 50 years’ time and politicians certainly do not have any better idea of this than engineers do. Although it started with good intentions, what remains, unfortunately, is a report full of wishful thinking in written form, with moral appeals and pointing fingers. Unfortunately, the German liberals cannot give their support to this.

 Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, plant protection products were, and still are, essential agricultural resources. Farmers require a minimum selection of plant protection products because it is a matter of protecting the indigenous cultural landscape, producing top-quality food and protecting resources. Our debates about chemicals are too often conducted on a very irrational level. We must think and act rationally if we are to achieve sensible results. The effects of Parliament's original position would have been fatal: a blanket ban on plant protection products would result in lower agricultural yields and, ultimately, rising food prices. Therefore, I am happy that an acceptable compromise was found in the trialogue negotiations. It is welcome that we have retained the three-zone ruling even with considerable exemptions for Member States. A courageous step to a consistent internal market solution would look different at this stage: Alongside the acceptable compromises achieved, we should not second guess a final definition of endocrinically effective substances but actually allow the Commission its four years to produce a scientifically-based definition. Otherwise, we will overstretch the precautionary principle here. I find it regrettable that we are not permitting any impact assessment of the agreement now reached.

Madam President, the agreement on the climate package is a modest result. The EU has set a reduction target of 20% compared with 1990. We have already managed just under half the reduction. The keyword is expansion to the east, where emissions are lower in absolute figures, leaving a reduction target of 12% compared with 1990. The EU should achieve 3% to 4% of the reduction in developing countries, leaving just under 9%. Targets can be missed by up to 5%. That leaves 4%. Normally one should say at this point, good, how lucky, the EU has decided not to export its entire economy to Asia. The compromise is clearly cheaper than the Commission proposal. That allows the German Free Democratic Party (FDP) to agree. Instead, the EU is now playing its own Member States off against each other; as a result of the energy mix, exemption rules and crafty negotiation, some Member States have an advantage over others. We could soon see German energy suppliers generating electricity in Poland rather than in Germany, unless they buy it from the French. The fact that the EU Member States are engaged in such horse-trading leaves little expectation of a global agreement and the question of efficiency of resources also arises. Governments, the Council and the EU Commission are called upon to provide for efficiency both for environmental protection and for the economy and growth.

 Mr President, if we adopt Euro VI for heavy-duty vehicles tomorrow, we will be doing so in a very good tradition. Not that long ago, in the course of this legislative period, we also voted in Euro 5 and Euro 6 for passenger cars, thereby continuing the success story of exhaust gas standards for vehicles – in today’s case heavy-duty vehicles – in Europe. I would like, at this point, to express my special thanks to the rapporteur, Mr Groote, with whom, once again, I experienced successful collaboration. Once again we are successfully bringing legislation to the first reading together, ensuring certainty of planning for industry and, of course, sound protection of the environment. The agreement with the Council and the Commission has produced a piece of viable legislation. The values for pollutants for heavy-duty vehicle exhaust gases are advanced in an ambitious way and the schedule is tightened up. The new limit values will enter into force earlier than the Commission originally proposed. In bringing this about, we are making a positive contribution to the protection of the environment and the health of the citizens of Europe, without unduly hitting the manufacturers. The entry into force of this regulation has been brought forward by nearly a year in comparison with the Commission proposal and yet the manufacturer’s product cycles and planning deadlines have still been taken into consideration. I welcome the fact that the Commission has learned from the mistakes of the past and accepted a deadline for comitology and for the tabling of the implementing measures. In this way we will, hopefully, avoid a delay like the one that occurred in the introduction of Euro 5 for passenger cars. The figures in the proposal for reducing emissions are impressive: 66% less soot, 80% less nitrogen oxides. As far as the reduction of pollutant emissions is concerned, the manufacturers are operating at the very limit of what is technically achievable. While maximum feasible improvements can always be made – and I fully believe in the creativity and inventiveness of European manufacturers in this regard – the closer you get to zero level, the more expensive the technology becomes. In light of this, the renewal of the stock of cars on the road is of increasing importance. Pollution-spewing old bangers that have not met the applicable standards for many a year must be taken off the roads. This would improve the emissions balance sheet more rapidly and more easily than expensive engine-tuning.

 Mr President, the environmental policy of the EU is facing a reality check. Economic performance in Europe is collapsing, and here we are considering how we can set up additional hurdles for our industry. Emissions trading is supposed to reduce emissions, but first and foremost it will increase costs. This increases the danger that jobs will be exported. Meanwhile the rest of the world is calmly watching us. China really only has to bide its time, then steel will be produced there and no longer in Europe. It is not for nothing that 11 000 steelworkers demonstrated in Brussels this week to keep their jobs. I welcome very much what Mr Swoboda has just said about the benchmark system, but the insight of the Social Democrats was very late in coming. I am convinced that we enormously overestimate our importance if we believe we can significantly influence the global climate by means of political measures. In the 21st century those societies which answer two questions intelligently will be successful: Where does our energy come from and how do we employ it efficiently? A policy of particularly expensive and ideological CO2
 avoidance, like that we are currently operating in Europe, will not lead to success.

 Mr President, even though we have now arrived at compromises, or perhaps precisely because we have now arrived at compromises, which – as Mr Schwab has just said – have removed the teeth from this legislative text, the question arises as to what is the point of this directive. In view of the very small market share of publicly purchased vehicles – we are talking about 1% of private cars and 6% of lorries – there can be no question of a significant contribution to climate protection being made. It is no more than a drop in the ocean. The expenditure it involves us in is not justified in terms of value. Above all, I find the use of procurement law as an instrument to be questionable. As an instrument of economic purchase by public authorities, procurement law is clearly designed to be related to the product, its suitability and its performance. Additional environmental criteria are simply not included. I should also like to point out that we shall debate product standards in Brussels. We are to debate emissions standards for lorries and private cars and are then also to debate CO2
 thresholds for private cars and lorries. We do not need additional European regulations governing product acquisition. We are in this case once again creating additional and useless bureaucracy and we are once again infringing the principle of subsidiarity.
 Holger Krahmer  (ALDE

 Mr President, I very much welcome the strategy set out in the White Paper, which will enable us to tackle the causes of poor nutrition and obesity and the diseases with which they are associated. Unfortunately, in Europe's food policy, whether we are talking about nutrient profiles or food labelling, or indeed in some aspects of the White Paper, we tend to resort to a very one-sided approach. We generally try to resolve Europe's problems through product policy. In my view, assuming that there are good and bad foods is fundamentally the wrong approach. As many of the amendments show, this is not the case. There are only good and bad, or balanced and unbalanced, types of diet. That should be our approach. There are many reasons why people eat the wrong type of diet. Addressing this problem by attempting to steer consumers in a particular direction with product labelling or even by introducing advertising bans or regulations or applying different VAT rates, will not bring us closer to our desired objective. I do not want to pre-empt the debate on the Food Labelling Directive, but I do believe that whatever action we take here should be guided by the principle that we should be motivating consumers to think about their eating habits. Traffic-light labelling – which is supposed to make the consumer stop and think whether he or she is about to choose a good or a bad product – is an approach which patronises consumers rather educating them and raising awareness. I would like to see a more balanced approach, along with the recognition that pursuing a solely product policy-oriented approach will not take us very far.

 Madam President, I am surprised, pleased and concerned all at the same time. My surprise is at the speed at which Parliament’s rapporteur, in a back-room meeting with the Council Presidency, managed to sweep practically everything from the table that Parliament has considered to be of importance to this dossier over the last two years. This should not be the benchmark for our debate of the energy package that is before us, for that is back-room politics not transparent democracy. However, I am pleased that we have kept our feet on the ground. In our inclusion of the airlines it is especially important to keep the cost of the system down, for any airline today that does not operate an efficient fuel management regime pays for it with their own demise. Finally, I am concerned at the wishful thinking that seems to be affecting many of us as regards the international situation. Mr Liese, emissions trading in the US was not rejected by the President but was defeated in the Senate, in which the party that holds the majority could well be providing the President the next time round. We really need to be realistic in our assessment of the situation, for even if we succeed in convincing the Americans to join in the emissions trading system we shall still be faced with a list of other countries around the world and I personally am not sure how we are ever going to start talking to them. I am thinking for example of the Emir of Dubai. In commercial terms this region is for us a much greater challenge and the competition from that particular source is much more significant than that which comes from a couple of – if you will forgive the word – bankrupt US airlines. This is something that we have completely ignored. It is very important to keep a sense of proportion, a sense of perspective when debating that we should certainly move ahead but not make so much progress that the others can no longer keep up with us. We are provoking a trade war here. This is something, Mr Liese, that you must have been made aware of one-to-one during your hearings in the US Congress, though funnily enough you will never say that openly here. For this reason we now have a compromise that is fairly realistic but, it is to be hoped, in terms of procedure is not ... (The President cut off the speaker)

 Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, food and hygiene go together; there is absolutely no doubt about that. Everyone has at some time in their lives eaten something that was 'off'. On the other hand, over-caution and excessively stringent regulation do not give us a cornucopia of foods which meet exemplary hygiene standards. A small producer is more likely to close down his shop because he cannot afford to pay the additional workers required to fill in forms rather than bake bread. My host, who serves the bread rolls, does not have to keep a record of whether he has wiped the counter and washed the dishes. After all, if he failed to take these basic precautions, he would have no customers anyway. What is happening is that responsible legislation is sliding into regulatory zeal that does more harm than good. That is why I am completely in favour of easing the administrative burden on companies, especially micro-enterprises, which find it more difficult to cope with this burden than the major corporations. I would like to see this greater awareness of the impacts on micro-enterprises being carried over into other areas of legislation that we discuss in this House as well, especially environmental and consumer protection.

Mr President, I thank Mrs Lynne for spending time on the subject of anti-discrimination and I am completely on her side up to a certain point. However, dear Mrs Lynne, Mrs Schroedter, Mrs Gröner and Mrs in ’t Veld, you mean well, but you are not doing yourselves any favours in the end if you are now calling for another directive against discrimination that goes beyond what we already have in Europe. I say this quite deliberately and quite bluntly here as a homosexual: you are not doing the people you want to protect any favours. There will ultimately be a far-reaching anti-discrimination regulation against the people whom you want to protect here. How can this be? If we extend anti-discrimination to access to goods and services and to a shifting of the burden of proof, we will create a climate of concealed discrimination. Very few employers will be openly willing to discuss discrimination. Job applicants who represent a potential risk, perhaps because of their passport photograph, will no longer be contacted by the employer in case of doubt. We are not doing people any favours in the end. We ought instead to be worrying about the fact that the anti-discrimination directive we have today is being changed and watching to see how it pans out. If we generate a tangled mass of bureaucracy and lawsuits as well as legal uncertainty, the acceptance of anti-discrimination regulations will decline among people in the European Union.

Mr President, I welcome market-based instruments as a means of implementing policies, including environmental policy. I would, however, make the point that no policy instrument is effective simply because it carries the label ‘market-based’. All the instruments that we use to achieve policy objectives must meet certain criteria. For example, is the instrument appropriate to the given objective? If we confuse different objectives we will not achieve any of them properly. If part of the thinking behind an environmental measure is that it should be a means of making money, we are already on uncertain ground because the measure is liable to be distorted for a variety of reasons. Does a given instrument actually help to achieve an objective? That question needs to be closely – and regularly – examined. Is a given instrument compatible with others that already exist? What about efficiency – the relationship between cost and benefit? Reading this report, I am doubtful in some cases whether the criteria I refer to have been met. Emissions trading systems work very well in theory but the reality is somewhat different. The EU Emissions Trading Scheme is in a state of chaos. Fortunes have been wiped out and the actual aim of the scheme has not been achieved. Fair enough, you may say, this is the experimental phase and we have not yet got it right; but we certainly cannot afford much more of this expensive experimentation. The policy on taxation of energy use also illustrates my point. Taxation really has no place in an EU Green Paper about market-based instruments. The mere fact that an instrument influences sections of the market does not make it market-based. I have no objection in principle to tax measures being used to achieve environmental objectives but I will support their introduction only if they meet the criteria I have mentioned. My case is that we should set out the objectives to be achieved; the choice of means to achieve them should then be left to those involved in the market.

Madam President, when we look back at the Bali conference, we cannot but conclude that it was the biggest, most expensive and most elaborate climate conference ever held and that it actually achieved only one result, namely an agreement to continue negotiating. If truth be told, nothing more came out of it. An honest appraisal in the aftermath of Bali compels us to analyse the conference as follows: first of all, the International Panel on Climate Change managed to convince much of global public opinion with its climate scenarios but was by no means as convincing on the conclusions to be drawn from the present situation; secondly, while Europe forges ahead on its own, there is scarcely any sign of willingness among the international community to enter into binding agreements on CO2 reductions. This applies not only to the United States but also to Japan, Canada, Australia and many other countries. A glance at the four remaining candidates with a realistic chance of becoming President of the United States shows fairly clearly that there is virtually no prospect of commitment to a UN process in the field of climate policy. We – by which I mean the EU – should rethink our strategy. What happens if the 2009 Copenhagen conference ends in failure? There are cost-effective alternatives to an international agreement, such as technology transfer, a decent system of incentives to protect tropical rain forests, carbon capture and storage and the development of nuclear energy too. The law of scarce resources will eventually induce even the United States and China to save energy and avoid CO2 emissions. The new industrial revolution will come when the price of oil rises. We do not need to force it by enacting laws.

Mr President, car manufacturing is one of Europe’s key industries. It employs some 12 million people, it represents innovation and growth and it produces something designed to provide individual mobility. It must therefore be our aim to see that the European car industry maintains its global leadership and its competitiveness. At the same time, however, we need to remember that in today’s global economy there is a very fine line between incentives for innovation and penalties for economic actions, and that, at the end of the day, we are still exporting the best products in the world and not just outsourcing our production locations. I essentially want to focus on the CO2 issue, which is without doubt one of the most important aspects of the subject we are discussing here. Lifestyle criticism, which Mr Verheugen mentioned, has long been an unpleasant aspect of the European climate debate. It is very ‘in’ to criticise individual lifestyles. Claude Turmes has just done as much. The thing is, if we were to withdraw all the two-tonne limousines from the market, as he would dearly like to do, the CO2 reductions would scarcely be measurable, but the damage to the national economy would be enormous. Let me now comment on the proposed CO2 regulation that is currently on the table. Mr Verheugen has said quite clearly in this respect that he has no wish to introduce legislation that would constitute a lifestyle criticism. However, when I look at the penalty payments now being proposed for minimal deviations from the prescribed limits, I tend to be of the view that this is precisely what the Commission has done. In actual fact, the regulation that we are discussing and approving here today is hostile to innovation, for the money that the car manufacturers will have to pay out is needed for innovation and research.

Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, ‘Yours for ever, AIDS’ were the words I read on a poster for World AIDS Day, which took place almost two weeks ago. The message was that AIDS is treatable but not curable. Many people, especially younger people, lose sight of that or choose to ignore it. The infection rates, to which previous speakers have referred, speak for themselves. Education is the only way to prevent HIV and AIDS, and I am pleased that the Commission subscribes to that view. Education, however, must not be confined to poster campaigns or visits to schools by government ministers. These things attract brief attention and may catch the eye of the media too, but they do not modify behaviour patterns, especially among young people. AIDS and HIV were once the stuff of real-life horror stories in the press. Many people felt insecure and afraid because nobody knew how dangerous the virus really was. I have no wish to return to those days, but with the existence of HIV/AIDS having become a fact of life and treatments having become safer, the problem no longer automatically captures the same level of public attention today. Many people have become accustomed to these messages, and some are even tired of hearing and seeing them. That is irrational, but it is a fact. Education must be adapted to take account of these changed circumstances. Education must be designed to reach out and capture people’s attention, to address tailored messages to specific target groups in their own vernacular. There are young people out there who misinterpret HIV as a negligible risk, and it is particularly important that we engage with them on their own cognitive ground and prompt them to think about the consequences of infection. Many people still do think about the consequences, but unfortunately they start too late, namely when a doctor or social worker tells them they have tested positive. Then the disease, which has hitherto been a dim and distant concept, suddenly becomes very real. Only if we manage to make people think about HIV before it is too late shall we have made any progress. Patient long-term efforts will be needed to achieve that goal. There must be facilities, services and projects designed for target groups – the more differentiated and the closer to personal experience they are, the better they will be. The organised AIDS charities, such as the AIDS-Hilfe 
associations in Germany, can continue to play an important role here if they rise to this new challenge. That, unfortunately, is not happening everywhere. Those who are HIV-positive today have a good chance of a long life, in western Europe at least. In other parts of the world, such as Africa, it is a different matter. This comfortable situation of ours, however, should not breed complacency.

 Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, the compromise on the Air Quality Directive is primarily the result of successful team work. I wish to emphasise this at the outset. My thanks especially to all my fellow Members who have taken an active part in defining the text of this Directive, particularly to the rapporteurs, Mrs Weisgerber of the Group of the European People’s Party (Christian Democrats) and European Democrats and Mrs Corbey of the Socialist Group in the European Parliament, as well as Mrs Hassi of the Group of the Greens/European Free Alliance. I should also like to thank the Commission for its valuable assistance and the Portuguese Council Presidency, which has made a vital contribution to this good result as an open and constructive negotiating partner. The compromise puts the EU’s future air quality policy on a sound footing. The new Directive maintains the balance between ambitious targets and limits and the necessary flexibility for implementation in the Member States. In addition, the focus is directed more towards exposure and increased awareness of the need for measures at the sources of pollution. Let me first outline the key elements of the compromise. There has been decisive progress, which is the intention with the amendment of air quality legislation, in the regulation of the finest PM2.5
 particulates. In the opinion of all the experts, the finest particulates originating exclusively from human sources pose the greatest risks to human health. Fine PM2.5
 dust particulates less than 2.5 micrometres in diameter and therefore not visible to the naked eye can penetrate the lungs and lead to serious, long-term respiratory diseases. Focussing on the smallest particles in European policy on air quality is therefore long overdue. In the United States, there has been a strict PM2.5
 limit since 1997. The United States is a good 10 years ahead of the EU with regard to legislation in this sector. However, with all due respect for US air quality policy, I should like to state that we cannot simply copy what the United States has been doing for years. We have completely different conditions in Europe, particularly with regard to population and traffic density. The demand by environmental groups for the immediate introduction of a strict PM2.5
 limit is unrealistic. Data in Europe is not strong and measurement experience is inadequate – not good conditions for a hasty introduction of a limit. The Council and Parliament have been in agreement since the outset on regulating PM2.5
 in two phases. Firstly, there should be a target from 2010 onwards and then a limit from 2015 onwards of 25 micrograms per cubic meter. Parliament has constantly been lobbying the Commission as well as campaigning against the Council’s opposition for a stricter value for PM2.5
. It is therefore to Parliament’s credit that today we want to reduce the limit for PM2.5
 to 20 micrograms per cubic meter in a second stage in 2020. In addition to a target and limit for PM2.5
, an exposure concentration obligation of 20 micrograms will be introduced for the Member States in 2015. This has the aim of reducing background concentration and will have a positive effect on the protection of human health particularly in urban conurbations. The model proposed by the European Parliament for reducing concentrations of PM2.5 
by 2020 has likewise been implemented. There is a differentiation according to the Member States and greater account will be taken of inputs. As regards PM10
, a majority in Parliament lobbied at first reading for an ambitious annual limit, which is also better correlated to the daily limit in force. The position of the Council and the Commission not to touch the current limits at all has won recognition in the negotiations. With a three-year extension to the deadline for PM10
, the deadline extension is guaranteed until 2012 after the new Directive comes into force for local authorities, which have not been able to keep to the limits owing to their geographical position or meteorological conditions, despite all demonstrable efforts. Even though improving the quality of the ambient air will also be a major challenge for the EU in the future, I should like to raise three points that in my view should be noted when implementing this Directive and when revising the legislation in 2013. Firstly, the pollution of ambient air has fallen drastically in recent decades. As a new study by the European Environment Agency shows, around 50% of fine dust emissions were reduced in the period between 1990 and 2004 – therefore even before the introduction of the PM10 
limits. This has been achieved less through legislation than through technical progress. Secondly, conditions in the European Union and between the Member States vary enormously. I have already mentioned meteorological and geographical conditions. However, it is principally the widely differing population, traffic and industry densities that have the greatest influence. More consideration must be given to this when implementing future legislation. Thirdly, in order to reduce air pollution even further, neither short-term actions such as road blocks and traffic bans, nor stricter, paper-based limits will lead to success. Parliament greatly welcomes the Commission’s statement, to be published together with the new Directive in the Official Journal in 2008, on the adoption of measures at source. Air pollution can be reduced only in the long term and at EU level specifically by strengthening cross-border measures. The policy on sources, which has been given little consideration to date, should be the main focus in future, particularly private combustion plants, the shipping industry and also agriculture.

 Madam President, first of all, I too should like to convey my very sincere thanks to the rapporteur, Mrs Gutiérrez-Cortines, who has expended a great deal of energy in the last few months acting as a broker between proponents and opponents of a directive and who, in the end, managed to prepare the basis of a workable compromise. Nevertheless, I am, as I always have been, of the same opinion as the Members of this House who want to reject the Commission proposal. Let there be no mistake: our soils are the basis of our existence. Without healthy soil there is no agriculture, no natural cycle of nutrients and, in the long term, no life. We are responsible for protecting our soils from harmful effects where possible, and keeping them in good condition. However, this Directive is not the right way to achieve this. I do not believe that the question here is whether we wish to protect our soils better or not; instead, at the European level the question as I see it is: is this within our jurisdiction or not? I believe that it is not. Obviously, many Member States have developed their own functioning soil protection legislation, with more concern for and better solutions to local problems than would be possible with centralised regulation from Brussels. Therefore I would ask the House to support the amendments that retain operational scope for the Member States. Apart from that, we are about to create vast amounts of new bureaucracy and expense for administrative bodies and businesses. There are amendments that would use the mere establishment of an industrial business as a reason to require detailed examinations and reports. Let me quickly give you just one example, that of the building of industrial gas plants. These separate normal air, which is a mixture of gases, into its components –which does not harm the soil at all. We should not be worrying about things like that, but only about things where there is justified concern that they may contaminate the soil. I believe that it is high time we refrained from the preparation and publishing of soil status reports. That is an encroachment on freedom of contract. The sale of land is covered by civil law, with good reason, and it should stay this way. Ladies and gentlemen, I hope that, in the end, we shall achieve a Directive that really does guarantee protection of the soil and does not primarily increase administrative load.

 Mr President, my thanks in the first instance to the two rapporteurs on this topic, Mr Liese and Mr Jarzembowski, who evidently did not always have a smooth ride together on this topic. Together with investment in new technologies and the creation of further infrastructure, emissions trading can make an important contribution to the reduction of CO2
 emissions in aviation. In doing so, emissions trading must allow growth rather than hindering it. It should provide incentives to renew fleets and create more efficient, more modern aircraft. The Group of the Alliance of Liberals and Democrats for Europe is making the case for including all airlines in a single starting date of 2011. In our view, the emissions from 2004-2006 should serve as a basis. This rewards those airlines that have updated and modernised their fleet in the past. My group proposes setting the cap at 90%. This is ambitious, more ambitious than the Commission’s proposal, but not excessive. A maximum of 30% of the allowances should be auctioned off, in our opinion, to make it easier for new operators to enter the market. The revenues from the auction should primarily be used by the aviation sector to reduce emissions. We are also in favour of increasing the take-off weight to 20 tonnes, because we want to keep the bureaucratic hurdles for small operators to a minimum. I make the case for including aviation in a trading system that is as open and efficient as possible. Limiting how credits can be used makes no sense ecologically. Just as every gram of CO2
 emitted must be regarded in the same way, the reduction of emissions, too, has the same effect everywhere. There are good economic reasons for unlimited, flexible access to credits if emissions can be reduced elsewhere less expensively. Aviation is vitally important to Europe’s economic growth. Globalisation is unthinkable without airlines that are competitive. In future, people will want to fly more, not less, not only in Europe but also, in particular, to other parts of the world; we have to acknowledge this. The EU is single-handedly deciding to include aviation in emissions trading and is making both friends and enemies internationally in the process. If we Europeans want to lead the way in climate politics, we have to ask ourselves not only how far we should go but also how we can take everyone else with us. This question will come up again in Bali. Ladies and gentlemen, it is time to distance ourselves from insular EU solutions in climate policy.

Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, not only with regard to protecting non-smokers, but also in other matters, I believe we should not take the EU’s powers to extremes. What are we really talking about here? Surely the point is to initiate discussion about a potentially smoke-free Europe, not to wage a crusade against people who consume a product that is legal in Europe. However, some of the contributions to this discussion, and many of the amendments, sound more like a religious war than the debate that I feel would be appropriate. In the same way, the report stated that this policy should create an environment in which smoking was no longer seen as normal. I do not believe that it is the task of politicians to teach people how to behave or to dictate to people what they should think. We should keep things in perspective when it comes to the question of what the EU should regulate and what it should not. Regulations structuring the tax systems of individual Member States are not part of our competence, nor are wide-ranging bans on smoking. Put simply, the Member States have not given us that authority. Even though there is a trend towards non-smoking in Europe, to exploit this trend to adopt excessive rules and to ride the wave of public approval is bad form, in my opinion. We are talking here almost exclusively of bans. Bans usually only increase the attraction of whatever has been forbidden, especially for young people, the group that we are particularly concerned about. Instead, we should focus our energy and money on educating people about the harmful consequences of tobacco consumption, targeting each group as individually as possible. That is the only way to get people to make wise decisions in the long term.

Madam President, many of my fellow Members believe we need strict rules for dealing with plant protection agents, and they are right, but at the same time we must not ignore the impact of the legislation we adopt. The fact is that plant protection products are an important element of modern-day agriculture. Take the example of the regulation on authorisation. We are in the process of banning entire clusters of active substances on the basis of exclusion criteria, simply because of an abstract notion of hazardousness. This approach ignores the actual risk involved in applying these agents down on the farm. It leads us to ban active substances which do not pose any problem at all in practice. As a result, not enough active substances will be available in future to combat pests properly. If only a few active substances are used, resistance to pesticides will develop more quickly. There will be no reliable means left to deal with many pest problems. And these are probably the new heights to which Mrs Breyer just referred. When that stage is reached, the security of Europe’s food supply will plumb new depths. Instead of imposing blanket bans we should be providing for a reliable licensing procedure that examines the actual risk involved in the use of each substance. The next example relates to the strategic approach to this issue, in which we argue for an across-the-board Europe-wide reduction target for the use of plant protection products. That, however, has nothing at all to do with the risks involved in their use. The Commission had set targets for reducing the actual risk. That is a good idea, and we should retain it. When all is said and done, we should focus on what is feasible, namely efficient pest control coupled with proper risk management. After all, it is also a matter of establishing how the growing need for raw vegetable materials is to be met in future. In the past innovative plant protection products have helped to make production grow faster than demand for arable land. Our aim for the future should not be to reverse this situation.

Madam President, when it comes to discussing CO2
 emissions, we are very quick to talk about cars, simply because the way to a person’s guilty conscience is through their car. That is why Mrs Harms, the Greens and many environmental organisations are particularly keen to talk about cars. We are faced with a broken voluntary pledge – no doubt about that – and we therefore need regulation. We have no alternative. What you came here and told us, Mrs Harms, about the voluntary commitment being deliberately and strategically torpedoed by the car industry seems rather far-fetched to me. Let me just remind you that a market comprises not only suppliers of products but also those who demand them. We ourselves help to create demand too, and shortly, when we are driven home by the car service, we shall be using those very cars that do not meet the targets to which the car makers committed themselves. I should like to see an initiative from the Greens. If your intentions are honourable, please now make sure that the small cars which meet next year’s voluntary target are ordered for Parliament. In future legislation, it is imperative for us to ensure that the desired reductions stand up to cost-benefit analysis. The Stern 
report which you and the Greens like to quote, Mrs Harms, calculates that, of 13 potential CO2
-reduction measures, those targeting cars at the very top of the price range are actually the least effective. Anyone making political demands for stringent emission limits and more efficient cars must recognise that the development and production cycle in the car industry takes five to seven years. It is by failing to recognise that, Mrs Harms, that we put jobs at risk, not by recognising it. I am therefore pleased that our rapporteur has done just this by saying that it is unrealistic to set any deadline before 2015. Tomorrow Parliament will vote in favour of one of the options on the table, and it must be said that, whatever it is, whatever year is designated and whatever average value is set, it will still be more stringent and ambitious than any other regime in the world. We should not lose sight of that. There is an extremely fine line between carrot and stick for our car industry, and at the end of the day we must take great care to ensure that we really do export the best products and not perhaps our industry.

 Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, I agree: mercury is highly toxic. It is harmful to the environment, to animals and, through the food chain and by other routes, to human beings. It is right that this element should be replaced where it is possible and sensible to do so, but not always and at any price and not because of the properties of the substance itself, but whenever its use really does present a hazard to the environment. We cannot remove mercury from circulation completely in any case, because then we would also have to say goodbye to another product that is much valued by many Members of this House. The energy-saving light bulb, which many would prefer to impose by law in order to protect the climate, also contains mercury. If energy-saving light bulbs were universally used, we would have at least as much of it in our households as at present with traditional barometers. I do not think much of banning mercury and a whole group of craft businesses from the EU market tomorrow while at the same time wanting to screw mercury lamps into our light fittings. I would be interested to hear what the Commissioner has to say about these conflicting aims.

 Madam President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, I, too, would like to thank both the rapporteurs, and particularly Mrs Jackson, who, in seeking compromises in an extremely complex regulatory framework, is evidently getting on top of a mammoth task. I have to say, though, that the impression I got from the way the first reading went was that this House is engaged in doing the opposite of what we originally sought to achieve by revising this legislation, that is to say, simplifying European law on waste and making it less bureaucratic. What is needed in the application of the hierarchy of waste is flexibility, a flexibility that is necessary if economically and ecologically reasonable flows of waste are to be made a practical possibility. What I would say to Mr Sacconi, who is unfortunately currently leaving the Chambers, is that life-cycle analyses are a bureaucratic business, and, rather than in practice ensuring the flexible management of the hierarchy, will have precisely the opposite effect. Contrary to our aim of avoiding waste, they produce superfluous paper. I am aware that people have very considerable reservations about a flexible hierarchy of waste, but taking a look at the practice of modern waste management will help to reduce them; new technical processes have brought new solutions with them, and we should not use the revision of a law to make tried and tested practices illegal; there is no longer any reason not to treat recycling and the use of waste as an energy source as being of equivalent value. If you really want resources to be better used and lifecycles to be managed, you have to abandon your ideological blinkers. Let me just add something about autarky. There is, in principle, no place in environmental legislation for market regulations, which are, both ecologically and environmentally, counterproductive in their effects. It is regrettable that it is in the field of environmental legislation that we avail ourselves of the internal market or dispense with it as we please. This is not about the prevention of waste tourism but about seeking, through Europe-wide competition, those solutions that work best both environmentally and economically. It is a lamentable and obvious fact that, in the current debate about the autarky principle, national and regional interests take precedence over everything else.

 Mr President, in the first place thanks are due to the rapporteur for having produced this excellent piece of work. That is a big compliment, Matthias, for it is not every day that I praise Social Democrats. The close cooperation between the rapporteurs has decisively contributed to the fact that we have been able to achieve a good compromise and a consensus at first reading. With Euro 5, the soot particle problem of diesel vehicles is practically solved, particulate matter emissions are reduced by 80%, and, thanks to modern engine filters and particle filters, many a new diesel passenger car will have an exhaust that lets out cleaner air behind than it sucks in at the front. We also achieve a drastic reduction in the nitrogen oxides emitted by diesel vehicles. As rapporteur for the air quality directive I can tell you I wish that all technical systems were as clean and energy-efficient as our modern passenger cars. I am pleased that we could agree on a realistic timetable for the introduction of the new limit values, one which takes into account the production cycles of the modern automobile industry. The ‘green side’ of this House would like to see Euro 5 and Euro 6 introduced earlier, and also stricter limit values for nitrogen oxides, as, indeed, do we all, and the ‘green side’ is even right in saying that the technology to do this already exists, of course it does, but we cannot pursue illusory policies here. Not only do businesses bear responsibility, but they also incur risks. Technologies must not only be available, but must also be marketable and affordable for the consumer. It does little for the environment if new, clean cars are not affordable and we therefore cannot get the old ones off the roads. Even today, it is not the new cars which are the problem. More than half of all the passenger cars in Europe only comply with the Euro 3 standard or less, and our goal must therefore be to completely renew all vehicles on the road. We were generous with the exceptions for M1 vehicles, but I think that this is justified, since the effects on the environment are comparatively small. The fact is that SUVs are popular with consumers and there is a trend towards larger cars. However, it is not the job of the legislator to criticise this. In a market economy – and when it comes to environmental decisions I keep wanting to remind people about this – the decision to buy is, in the end, made by the consumer. I come from the system of the former GDR, where the state and party leadership decided for us what the best car for each individual was, and that is something I have no desire to go back to.

 Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, I should like to start by thanking the rapporteur, Mr Schlyter, for his constructive cooperation. It is well known that the two of us do not always see eye to eye, but I welcome the fact that a vote is to be held tomorrow on a compromise that will enable agreement at first reading. I also welcome the fact that the compromise disregards a number of the demands made by the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Food Safety such as the precipitate inclusion of PFOA without a prior risk assessment. The toxicity of PFOS is undisputed, including by industry. After all, industry took it upon itself to dispense with the use of PFOS in particularly critical applications such as consumer goods. Some sectors at the top end of the value-added chain, such as the aviation, aerospace and semiconductor industries, cannot dispense with the use of PFOS at present, however. A ban on PFOS or a derogation involving strict time limits would deprive some high-technology sectors of planning security. The Commission proposal already lays down appropriate derogations for this, and it is essential that these be retained until there is a suitable substitute. The problem with PFOS is not the use of the substance in these sectors, however, but the fact that it is still found in old textiles such as carpets and clothing and reaches the environment via these. I should like to make some concluding remarks on EU chemicals policy with regard to the forthcoming REACH debate. EU chemicals legislation must strike a balance between the socio-economically appropriate use of certain substances and high environmental standards. As with PFOS, derogations must always be possible where there are no suitable alternatives. After all, the objective of chemicals policy must be the safe, risk-based handling of chemicals rather than the ideological policy of complete chemical bans. I hope that the Commissioner will remain committed to a sound chemicals policy in future, too.

 Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, I would like to begin by thanking the shadow rapporteurs from the European People’s Party and Socialist Groups, Mrs Weisgerber and Mrs Corbey, for their cooperation, but I also want to thank the Commission and both the Austrian and Finnish Presidencies of the Council for their openness and willingness to engage in dialogue. That there is not always complete agreement about everything, whether within this House or between one institution and another, should become the norm in European democracy, for what really matters is that we, although we approach it from different angles and with different priorities, should have one single end in mind, that being that air quality in Europe should be improved. That many respiratory diseases and the consequences resulting from them are attributable to high levels of air pollution, particularly in densely-populated areas and conurbations in the EU, is not disputed. Polluted air takes no account of borders, and so improving the quality of our ambient air remains a major challenge. The problem of air pollution can only be solved in the long term and in a European framework, particularly by stepping up cross-border measures. In order for the ambitious goals to be achieved, further instruments will be needed in the Community in future: clean air in the Member States can only be achieved if the directives which are in force are transposed consistently and if new EU legislative proposals concentrate on restricting emissions at the point where polluters cause them. While there is justifiable concern about the state of ambient air in Europe, I would like to take this opportunity to emphasise that air quality in Europe has, over the past decades, been improved as a result of stringent legal regulation and technical advances. Prior to the July vote in the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Food Safety, and looking forward to the vote we are about to take in this plenary, all three of the main groups in this House negotiated a package of compromise amendments, which can be summed up as aiming for, on the one hand, ambitious limit and target values, with, on the other, greater flexibility and consideration of the difficulties that individual Member States face with the transposition of the current directive. Let me briefly sketch out the essential points. I will start with PM10. There is a large degree of consensus in this House about the lack of ambition inherent in allowing the 40 microgram annual average value for PM10 to remain unchanged after 2010. This value is already adhered to in most European cities. The Commission had already announced a more stringent annual average value for PM10 with effect from 2010, but, as this present proposal makes no reference to it, the three big groups propose that the threshold value for PM10 be reduced to 33 micrograms with effect from 2010. I have to say, Commissioner, that I find it remarkable, in view of the criticism that these compromises attract, that you continually neglect to make this very point. Where the PM10 annual limit values are concerned, there is a marked downward turn. I would like to point out that this is not an example of the dilution of limit values that has attracted such strong criticism from the environmental organisations. The daily limit value for PM10, according to which 50 micrograms may be exceeded on at most 35 days in the year, has come in for forthright criticism from many Members, but the fact is that there is no correlation between the current daily and annual threshold values, and, moreover, the figure of 35 days is arbitrary. Nobody in this House would doubt the importance of carrying out daily measurements and informing at-risk groups of increased concentrations of pollutants. On the other hand, no credible scientist has as yet claimed that the daily limit value is more relevant to health policy than the annual one. The problems cities have with compliance with the daily limit value are no secret, and we abandon municipalities to a sort of organised helplessness. It has now been demonstrated that compliance with daily limit values is completely unrelated to any clean air measures, but rather largely dependent on chance meteorological phenomena. The Committee on the Environment and the three main groups in this House endorse the compromise proposal according to which the cities and municipalities affected would, in tandem with a reduction in the annual limit value of approximately 20%, be allowed – albeit only subject to certain conditions – rather more flexibility and permitted to comply with a limit value on a maximum of 55 rather than 35 days. There may be those who will have their doubts about the correlation between the daily and annual limit values proposed by this House, but nobody can claim with any seriousness that we are thereby being any less ambitious than the Commission and the Council. Let me now turn to PM2.5, the smallest particles, which are, according to all the experts, the source of the greatest hazards to health. However, the data obtained in Europe on PM2.5 are as yet uncertain, and most Member States have had insufficient experience with measurements of it. We therefore propose a two-stage regulation for PM2.5, with, in the first instance, a target value from 2010 onwards, and, with effect from 2005, a limit value around 20 micrograms; this too, is more ambitious than what the Council and the Commission are proposing. A majority in this House agrees that the 25 microgram annual average value as proposed by the Commission is lacking in ambition and that we should therefore reduce it. In its proposal, the Commission opted for an overall reduction of 20% for PM2.5 without undertaking any further impact assessment relating to the practical actions and costs resulting from it for each individual Member State. Like my fellow members of the committee, I am persuaded that a graduated model, with Member States being treated differently and greater account taken of previous achievements, is in any case preferable to aiming for a reduction across the board. Let me just say something about Article 20. I could understand the Commission’s and outside bodies' criticisms of the 5+5 rule – which aims to institute a time delay in order to enable the limit values to be reached. We have put together a new package called ‘4+2’, which represents a move towards the position taken by the Commission, which, as we know, is proposing a five-year period. I would like to reiterate air quality in Europe will be achieved only in the long term and only by means of actions targeting the problem at source, that is, the causes of pollution. I look to the Commission in expectation of the proposals that it has announced for reducing pollution at its source.

 Mr President, the MEPs belonging to the Free Democratic Party have voted against the resolution on the economic and social consequences of business restructuring operations in Europe, being convinced that, in Europe’s market economies, businesses should be free from political pressure in deciding where their production sites should be located. In our single market, competition – including competition between regions – plays a decisive role in terms of the further development of European enterprise and of the way in which it can keep itself fit. The ultimate effect of political pressure is to impede the functioning of the market and it is for that reason that it should not be applied as a means of deterring businesses from acting on their own decisions.

 Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, as an important transport sector, aviation is of vital significance to economic development in Europe. Worldwide and also in the EU, aviation is a growth sector, providing employment for more than four million Europeans. Although aviation accounts for only approximately 3% of global CO2 emissions, this proportion is growing constantly. The objective of our policy must be to reduce the climate-change impact without also reducing growth in this key sector. The growth and competitiveness of our airlines must not conflict with the reduction of greenhouse gases. The choice of instruments is vital to achieving this objective. The introduction of a kerosene tax and the levying of departure or airline-ticket taxes would only result in dampening demand. Making flying more expensive would reduce greenhouse gases, but only at the expense of growth, which is not absolutely necessary. The incorporation of aviation into the Emissions Trading Scheme, as proposed by the Commission, is a better alternative from an environmental and economic point of view. Emissions trading that is limited to the EU must offer guarantees that European airlines are not put at a disadvantage in comparison to other airlines. In addition, emissions trading must not become an end in itself, but must primarily create incentives for investment in improved technologies. The promotion of technology holds the key to harmonising the objectives of growth and reduction of CO2 emissions. The European aviation and space-travel industry, in particular, has made a decisive contribution to the development of engines with greater fuel efficiency, and thus of cleaner aircraft. In addition to the promotion of technology, two further aspects need to be taken into account that have been neglected in the debate on reducing emissions. Firstly, the creation of a single European airspace and air traffic control area – the ‘Single European Sky’ project – and secondly the extension of airports. Even without regulatory enthusiasm, we can achieve a considerable reduction in greenhouse gases by reducing flying distances and avoiding stacking.

Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, flooding is a disaster scenario that threatens many areas of Europe year after year. In the last few years alone, floods in Europe have cost hundreds of human lives, made hundreds of thousands of people homeless and caused billions’ worth of damage. Experts say that the likelihood of recurring floods is set to increase still further in future years. In the summer of 2002, many riverside areas in Central Europe were flooded. I myself come from Saxony, a region that was particularly hard hit by those floods, and many of you will no doubt recall the pictures of our flooded capital, Dresden. In the aftermath, my region, like many of the flood-stricken countries, was engaged not only in reconstructing and restoring the destroyed infrastructure but also in devising sound strategies for the long-term avoidance and management of floods in the affected areas. There were loud calls for European assistance at that time. The solidarity fund was set up even before a specific European directive was drafted. I would not question in principle the need for Community legal provisions and action plans, since most of Europe’s river basins are divided between two or more countries, and purely national strategies are sometimes inappropriate. In its proposal for a directive on the assessment and management of floods, the Commission has produced a great deal of unnecessary red tape. I should like to focus on two specific points. Firstly, the draft directive clearly infringes the subsidiarity principle, particularly in Articles 7 and 9. The idea that the Member States should have to compile flood-risk maps and management plans for parts of river basins is unacceptable. We should only make European rules for matters that need to be regulated on a European scale. The directive should concentrate on river basins straddling national borders. Secondly, little or no consideration is given to existing plans and measures. In many Member States there are already adequate arrangements for national water bodies and watercourses. The very countries that have suffered from flooding in the past now possess very good strategies and plans which take account of both the European flood-protection objectives and specific local conditions. I therefore wholeheartedly support the amendment establishing a new Article 16a, which would recognise the Member States’ previous work inasmuch as it coincides with the aims of the directive. Countries must be given the necessary leeway in this respect, for our failure to introduce a healthy dose of flexibility would make transposition a hugely expensive business for those very countries that have already done a great deal of work in developing efficient strategies. The draft must be adjusted accordingly. We say yes to European flood prevention but no to infringement of the subsidiarity principle and to unnecessary red tape.

 Madam President, Commissioner Verheugen, ladies and gentlemen, I too would like to congratulate the rapporteur, especially on her negotiation skills and on the constructive result that we have today. This regulation on the security of children’s medical products is a great success for patients in Europe. It is long overdue, and now it is important that it enter into force quickly. This is why the Group of the Alliance of Liberals and Democrats for Europe supports this helpful compromise, which makes an agreement with the Council at second reading possible. We have had lengthy and extensive debates in this House on the renewal of patents for research-conducting producers of medicines, and sometimes there was haggling over each individual month of renewal. Many colleagues have been quite upset about the possibility of additional profits for the pharmaceutical industry. This unspeakable debate is now finally over. This is, after all, about the security of medical products for children, which must be guaranteed. If the research-conducting producers of medicines require an additional incentive in order to develop their products, then they should get it. Finally, economic logic requires it too. If this incentive has the additional effect of strengthening European research and attracting research-conducting pharmaceutical businesses back to Europe, then this is positive.

 Mr President, even though the Council ignored this House’s abundantly clear vote on the health claims at first reading, we have now reached a compromise that I – albeit with gritted teeth – will vote to accept, for, as Mrs Sommer so rightly said, we are now, in practical terms, being faced with the choice between a great evil and a lesser one. Turning specifically to two contentious points, I do believe that trademarks are subject to a different legal regime, are covered by other regulations and are quite out of place here. As for nutrient profiles, whilst the compromise has made it possible for the profiles to be prevented from having a prohibitive effect, we are nonetheless a long way off making the right deletion, as we did at first reading. I remain convinced that nutrient profiles are a misguided concept. Obesity and excess weight are problems that need to be taken very seriously; they are the subjects of emotional debates that will be with us again – by the time of the Green Paper on the promotion of healthy eating at the latest. I would like, at this juncture, to briefly jump ahead and say that advertising does not make people fat. The causes of obesity are multifarious and highly complex, and it is not by imposing more bans that we will successfully address them. We should seek the solution in cooperation with the food industry rather than in opposition to it.

 Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, health policy falls essentially within the competence of the Member States. There is a good reason for that. Health systems are paid for out of contributions and taxes, and the various systems are geared to specific needs. Moreover, the principle of subsidiarity applies for the field of health services and medical care. Article 152 of the EU Treaty requires Member States to ensure a high level of health protection. The EU can also take measures in support of Member States’ policies. I sometimes get the impression that the Commission and some of our fellow Members, too, would prefer to compete with national policies on health. We have the same problem with health policy as also constantly recurs in other fields: Europe is suffering from being unable to do the important things it ought to be concerned with. The upshot is that the EU embraces many areas of policy which, if in doubt, would be better dealt with by the Member States and interferes assiduously in their affairs. That does not of course mean that Europe should keep its hands off health policy. Rather, the EU must concentrate on things that have real European added value, and here I can pick up directly what the previous speaker was saying: Europe should take action primarily on cross-border questions that one Member State is unable to deal with alone. Top priority must be given to improving the exchange of information and to closer cooperation in coordinating the fight against epidemics and infectious diseases. The health risks resulting from bird flu show the urgency of cross-border coordination of measures. The same goes for HIV and Aids, a major problem in the new Member States in particular, and one which is increasingly being forgotten and neglected even though infection rates are rising. The EU should set stronger priorities for fighting disease. My group has tabled amendments on this, for which I would again like to canvas your support. The focus should be on the most important widespread diseases, such as diabetes, cancer and cardiovascular diseases; that is where the EU’s measures and scarce resources must be concentrated. We should not take it upon ourselves to make a shopping list. In Committee, we discussed at length what diseases and what preventive measures should have priority in the action programme. Let us be consistent in our demands here. Parliament’s December 2005 resolution on the work programme calls explicitly for measures to combat diabetes, cancer and cardiovascular diseases. The terms of the proposal for the Commission action programme were too general, too broad. It is time for us to set political priorities and concentrate on the most widespread diseases. I would also like to say a few words about the budget and the funding of NGOs. My Group supports the rapporteur’s proposal that the budget for the action programme be increased to EUR 1.2 billion. If we are serious about the priorities we are setting with this programme, we will of course need the resources to match. Patients’ associations and non-governmental organisations are playing an increasingly important role, which justifies them receiving EU support. When funding NGOs, however, we must ensure there are strict criteria and transparency. It cannot be acceptable that some organisations – as happens in the environmental field – are so lavishly endowed that they can pay for Brussels offices as though they were subsidiaries of the EU Commission.

 Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I wonder whether I will live to see homosexuality accepted and lived as something completely normal. I wonder whether the time will come when politicians will no longer be able to make political capital for themselves with discriminatory comments about homosexual people, and I wonder when same-sex partnerships will be recognised as sharing responsibilities and enjoying equal rights. There is something about the view – as expressed in the Pope’s definition – of homosexual couples as merely convenient arrangements for the purpose of pursuing meaningless sex that betrays a contempt for people, and it bears no relation to the reality of life as lived by homosexual couples. Discrimination against homosexual lifestyles and their marginalisation begins in people’s heads, and our adopting a directive on the subject will not put a stop to it. The events in Poland are no more accidental than the latest utterances of one Italian minister are slips of the tongue; rather, they are expressions of an attitude of mind. Combating homophobia is an educational task, and it is intended that 2007 should be the Year against Discrimination. The Commission needs to give the fight against homophobia the same level of priority among its activities as the combating of discrimination on the grounds of gender, race or religion.

 Mr President, I would like to concentrate on the three core aspects of this directive, those being its legal basis, the ban on cadmium, and the collection targets. This directive has as its priority objective the reduction and avoidance of waste batteries, but we cannot overlook the fact that it is also an example of product-oriented legislation for the internal market. The fact that it has Article 175 as its sole legal basis could result in varying standards and hence in distortions of competition and of the market. It is for that reason that the Liberals support Articles 95 and 175 as a dual legal basis, and in so doing we are doing as the Legal Affairs Committee has recommended. In both the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Food Safety and the Council, a ban on cadmium and mercury was adopted only in relation to portable batteries. Our group is not in favour of there being any further bans on marketing or of the ban on cadmium being extended to, for example, tools without cables or medical equipment. The example of power tools is always being quoted, and I will say now, particularly for the benefit of Mr Schlyter and also Mrs Westlund, that there are of course alternatives to nickel-cadmium available for those, but every kind of technology has its advantages and disadvantages. In the case of rechargeable batteries and accumulators, which amount in any case to only a very small quantity of waste, we have to consider other characteristics as well, such as energy efficiency, useful life and, of course, the price that the consumer has to pay for them. The presence of an alternative on the market does not necessarily mean that it is an adequate substitute. The actual amount of cadmium that we in Europe absorb through our environment is considerably below the level regarded by the WHO as harmful to health, and it is worth noting that only about one per cent of it comes from batteries. Let me conclude by considering the collection targets. The Council is not aiming very high with its targets of 25% after six years and 45% after ten, but it has to be said that the 40% and 60% respectively on which we agreed in the Committee are not realistic; the quotas in some Member States are under 10%. In Germany, over ten years of all-out effort have enabled us to achieve 35%. It follows that it is important that we review the collection targets in six years’ time and, in so doing, learn from the experience and best practice in the Member States. Finally, I would like to emphasise that all stakeholders bear a responsibility for this; while we must not dump the costs of collection on the retail trade, we do have to oblige traders to collect!

 Mr President, one of the key elements of this regulation is data requirements for registration. A very satisfactory compromise has been put before the House on this issue, and it has gained the support of the three main groups in Parliament. In this context, and addressing my comments in particular to the Group of the Greens/European Free Alliance, I should like to reiterate the point that a compromise backed by such a large parliamentary majority is an entirely normal democratic procedure. Accusations that this House has been hypnotised by the chemical industry are insulting, and we should voice our protest at them. The Group of the Alliance of Liberals and Democrats for Europe has always championed a workable version of REACH. Our key demand is a system that cuts costs significantly for businesses, especially small businesses, and avoids unnecessary red tape, without sacrificing the goals of environmental and consumer protection. As recently as one year ago, our position was branded industry-oriented; it is now the consensus view. It involves the introduction of exposure categories, a significant relaxation of the rules for low-tonnage substances and the granting of derogations for research and OSOR. At the same time, however, the other key element of REACH, namely the authorisation of chemicals, must not fall prey to a political success story where registration is concerned. The point is that REACH does not only affect the chemical industry, and I say this particularly for Mr Nassauer’s benefit, since this is something he is wont to stress most emphatically. Instead, it affects all sectors that process chemical substances. The Group of the Alliance of Liberals and Democrats for Europe has retabled the proposal of the Committee on Industry, Research and Energy concerning authorisation, since it is eminently sensible. Businesses need clear criteria in order to comply with legislation and plan ahead. Hazardous substances should only be replaced if scientific evidence indicates that safe alternatives exist. Furthermore, a flexible approach must be taken to the temporary authorisation of chemicals, with due consideration for sector-specific product cycles.

 Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, in voting on the directive on mobile air-conditioning systems, my group, like the majority of this House, will follow the rapporteur’s sensible path and adopt the Common Position without major amendment, for it represents a good compromise. A GWP threshold value of 150 reduces emissions by 90%. The deadlines – 2011 for new types and 2017 for new models – are ambitious enough, and it will also be possible for the manufacturers to meet them. The Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Consumer Protection has already voted to reject the demand for the reintroduction of GWP 50. Compared with a threshold value of 150, a GWP threshold value of 50 has no significant impact on the greenhouse effect; that is confirmed, not by the car industry, but by the British impact assessment, the Commission and the Swedish Environment Ministry. Setting the GWP at 50 would exclude all the alternatives to CO2 as refrigerants for mobile air-conditioning systems, but it is not for the legislator to prescribe one single technology to the industry. We should instead leave that to the engineers and promote competition between environmentally-friendly alternatives. The core issue with the f-gas Regulation is its legal basis. There is no apparent reason why we should have different legal bases for stationary air-conditioning systems on the one hand and for mobile ones on the other. In both instances, we are dealing with product-oriented legislation for the internal market. If the confidence to plan ahead, legal certainty and common standards in the internal market are to be guaranteed, then the legal basis should be Article 95. This expresses a clear commitment to both high environmental standards and a functioning internal market in which all are subject to the same ground rules. At a time when we frequently find ourselves discussing better regulation, I would, in this specific instance, remind the House of the problems involved in transposing the electronic waste directive, which is based on Article 175.

 Mr President, the regulation on the safety of medicinal products for paediatric use is a necessary and sensible alternative that puts an end to a long period of uncertainty surrounding medicinal products in the paediatric sector. The Commission’s proposal was well-balanced and was based on impact assessments. A six-month extension of patent protection as an incentive for pharmaceutical manufacturers is reasonable. This period is based on the results of the impact study and is a clear, fair basis for calculation for all manufacturers. I am pleased that a majority in Parliament supports this fixed period. Variable patent protection is impracticable and entails a considerable administrative burden. In addition, the duration of a patent must never be dependent on a product’s sales figures. The international competitive situation of the research-oriented pharmaceutical industry demands that we take a look at Europe’s attractiveness as a research destination. This is another reason why I see no material arguments in favour of the reduction in the fixed six-month period that is still under discussion.

Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons are dangerous substances used in the manufacture of tyres for various vehicles. Because of their toxicity, we are today debating their restriction. We have before us a compromise which will probably be accepted tomorrow by a large majority. Happy though I am when we avoid ideological debates on technical issues and adopt slim directives in a short space of time, there are a couple of minor but important aspects that we have overlooked. A proposed amendment, which I jointly initiated and which was originally accepted in the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Food Safety, aimed to obtain an extension to 2012 for certain urgently needed technical applications. These were exceptions for armoured, fire brigade, rescue and other special purpose vehicles. The number of applications is extremely minor and the damage to the environment negligible. The original exemption for aircraft tyres, to which no time limit was originally attached, was also buried in the compromise package. On this point, Parliament is about to take an irresponsible decision. The aviation sector operates at physical limits, which is why the safety aspect must not be compromised and must even come before environmental aspects. Industry cannot guarantee that we shall have alternatives available by 2010 which will meet the specific and extremely demanding safety standards for aircraft tyres. I fail to understand how the Council could totally disregard this aspect, especially as the European Aviation Safety Agency was not consulted and there has been no follow-up assessment on it. I am not in favour of more bureaucracy, but in such a safety sensitive sector as aviation, more careful attention should have been paid to the risks, especially as this is what we do with other regulations in the environmental sector where we often rush past the target. I have received a letter from the European Cockpit Association, which represents 34 000 pilots in Europe and expresses great concern about this. I wish to highlight this, because the pilots certainly cannot be suspected of engaging in industrial lobbying. I would like to know from Commissioner Verheugen whether he is aware of this problem. As I see it, this compromise is unacceptable if this aspect is disregarded.

 Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, the rapporteur deserves a great deal of thanks, particularly for raising the question as to whether a European directive of this kind is needed at all. As Montesquieu said a few centuries ago, ‘If it is not necessary to make a law, then it is necessary to refrain from making a law’. I regard the Bathing Water Directive as a good example of the sort of directive that Europe can well do without. Europe’s constant urge to harmonise results in an excess of regulation, which means that the European Union becomes more and more distant from the public. The other side of that coin is that more and more members of the public become disenchanted with a European Union the most visible aspect of which is the way it decks itself in an array of bureaucratic rules and regulations. Let me come to the point with which we are concerned in this instance. Every region possessing stretches of water for bathing or leisure activities has an intrinsic interest in maintaining them to a high standard; if it does not, the penalty it pays is that visitors and tourists stay away. The creation of a legal framework in this area should remain a matter for the Member States, for I certainly cannot see it having any effect on the internal market. Again, I do not think I need to discuss how badly many environmental regulations are transposed in the EU, as there are enough infringement proceedings in progress – a plethora of them, in fact – to demonstrate that. If Europe wants to become more transparent to its citizens, then, where the protection of the environment and of health is concerned, we have to concentrate on what must – and can – be done at European level. What this means is that, if we have doubts as to whether or not a function should be performed at the European level, we should leave the responsibility for it with the Member States. I do not regard the Bathing Water Directive as a vitally necessary component of European integration.

 Mr President, I would like to discuss this question by the Greens and, potentially punishable offences against the WTO apart, to address a couple of questions to its author. Mr Juncker, your question expresses the fear that the removal of barriers to trade might result in tax dumping. In it, you also make reference to subsidies undermining the multilateral trade system. Do you not believe that there is a connection between high taxes and high subsidies? Do you assume that, in a world without tariffs – which are barriers to trade – and the competition to which they give rise, social and environmental standards would invariably and inevitably fall? As you never fail to mention competition in the same breath as words like ‘harmful’ and ‘dumping’, are you afraid of it? What does actually bring prosperity and jobs – the exchange of goods and services in open markets without barriers to trade or, instead, more fragmented markets with high barriers to trade? Do you, like me, take the view that only a competitive national economy is in a position to comply with high environmental standards? If so, should we then not abandon, once and for all, the constant pretence that low taxes and open markets amount to the same thing as low environmental and social standards? I would also be interested to learn what the Commissioner thinks about this.

 Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, I would like to begin by thanking my fellow members of the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Food Safety, in particular the shadow rapporteurs, for their good and constructive cooperation. Some 15 million motor vehicles come off the production lines in the EU every year, and the motor industry is one of the most important business sectors in Europe, creating jobs, encouraging innovation and vital in terms of our competitiveness. Cars, though, also produce waste, and that is what we are discussing this evening. Every year in Europe, ten million vehicles end up on the scrapheap. If cars are not piled up as high in scrap yards as they used to be and are less of a blot on the landscape, that has something to do with the considerable extent to which parts of cars can be reused and recycled. The objective of the motor vehicle type approval directive is to lay down provisions whereby motor cars and light commercial vehicles can be constructed in such a way that they meet the minimum quotas laid down in the end-of-life vehicles directive in respect of reusability, recyclability and recoverability. The end-of-life vehicles directive imposed binding targets on manufacturers. With effect from 2006, at least 85% by mass of a car – and with effect from 2015 at least 95% of it by mass – must be recoverable and reusable or capable of being recycled. These – the 95% from 2015 onwards in particular – are very ambitious targets, for they would mean that the cars of the future would produce scarcely any waste. Whether or not this goal is achieved will depend not only on the manufacturer’s use of certain materials, but also and primarily on the further development of recycling technology and on the definition of recyclability. There is nevertheless no disputing the fact that the recyclability of automobiles and the avoidance of waste are important objectives for Europe’s environmental policies. It is astonishing, however, that cars contribute only 1% of the total quantity of waste in the EU. The EU has made a particularly good job of minimising waste not only from packaging, electronic scrap and batteries, but also from used cars. Let me now turn to the core issues. Although the Commission put forward an eminently respectable proposal for a directive, it was necessary for us in this House to make a number of improvements to it. Following the committee’s vote and a successful trilogue, we have put together a compromise package for agreement at first reading, backed by the three main groups in this House. This being what one might call my maiden report, I, as rapporteur, regard that as a major success. Our joint amendments, on which we will be voting tomorrow, are aimed above all at improving the way in which the directive will be implemented, without jeopardising the achievement of the recycling targets, which are so important in terms of environmental policy. Type approval is meant to be practicable from the point of view of the competent authorities in the Member States and of the manufacturers, and to entail the minimum possible costs. The amendments also take into account important aspects of best practice in type-approval. As rapporteur, I have from the very outset been particularly concerned to maintain the distinction between the testing of new types and new models. New models are defined as automobiles that are already on the market in the EU – there are currently about 600 of them – while new types are automobiles that will come onto the market in the future, approximately 100 a year. The intention is that priority be given to the testing of new types. Neither the authorities nor the manufacturers would be capable of doing what the Commission envisaged in its original proposal, namely testing all models in the EU within 36 months of the directive’s entry into force. The testing of new types must be given priority in order to ensure that all of those coming onto the EU market in the future comply with the binding targets as imposed by the end-of-life vehicles directive, and so the 36-month time limit proposed by the Commission should apply to new types, enabling the models already in existence to be tested thereafter. We have agreed in this House – and with the Council – on a period of 54 months, corresponding to the arithmetical mean between what the Commission originally proposed and the 72 months that I originally put forward, which itself corresponds to the life-cycle of an average automobile. The definition of ‘reference vehicle’ is another case in point. It is good practice and avoids misunderstandings if the authority and the manufacturer select the type by mutual agreement. ‘Reference vehicle’ means the vehicle that is most problematic in terms of re-usability, recyclability and recoverability. Turning to the ban on heavy metals, I am glad to be able to say that we have been able to agree that the prohibition of heavy metals should be referred to under the heading of the preliminary assessment rather than that of type-approval, where it does not belong. It is in any case my view that the Commission had good reasons for refraining from banning heavy metals in its original proposal, for heavy metals are already prohibited by many other items of legislation. We did have a problem with one amendment from the Council, which reached us, so to speak, just before close of play, and which was intended to permit the comitology procedure through another back door. Parliament fought to get amendments to the end-of-life vehicles directive treated as legislation rather than as implementing measures, and so we could not accept the possibility of making technical adjustments to the end-of-life vehicles directive without reference to this House. I am glad that, in the trilogue, the Council and the Commission eventually agreed to that. This is a step in the right direction, towards more democracy and transparency in the process whereby European laws are made. Let me close by returning to the subject of regulation. Automobiles are, in the EU, regulated to an extraordinary degree. When enacting legislation, we must always consider that it will have to be implemented in places that are a long way from Brussels and Strasbourg. We have to consider the businesses that will ultimately be affected by it. Commissioner Verheugen, what I now say is addressed to you personally. I particularly welcome your initiative where the assessment of legislation’s impact is concerned and am glad that, in your role as industry commissioner, you have rediscovered your liberal roots. It is important that new directives and regulations, particularly those relating to the protection of the environment and of consumers, should in future be subject to checks to ascertain what effect they have on competitiveness. Existing directives must be examined in order to be capable of being implemented quickly in the Member States. When considering future regulations, though, we must, as a matter of priority, ensure that they really do help to protect the environment rather than entailing more bureaucracy. Thank you, Commissioner, for your kind words.

 Madam President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, I too would like to thank the rapporteur for her work, and do not envy her the task she had of bringing about this compromise. Nevertheless, I do still have certain issues with this directive. In my opinion, there is no getting round the fact that the political course we are following in this directive will ultimately and primarily result in bureaucratic barriers to market entry rather than more environmentally friendly products, and in fewer businesses and jobs in the electronic and electrical engineering industries rather than greater environmental protection on the basis of reduced resource consumption. We are continuing to rely on product and process management instead of formulating clear criteria that make sense in terms of the end product. What is stopping us from giving technicians and engineers a free hand to come up with creative ideas in the search for the best technological concepts? We will only find the best available technology, whether environment-related or otherwise, if we place no obstacles in the way of competition. The kind of product policy that has been proposed smacks to me of the targets set by the GDR’s planned economy, when decisions were taken at party conferences on how many colour televisions of a particular type would be produced within a certain space of time. Planned economies do not work, as was proven repeatedly during the 20th century, yet the Commission has apparently not yet caught on to this fact. The directive before us is not a million miles away from being the kind of instrument one would expect to find in a planned economy, and this is above all due to the ‘top runner’ approach, the preliminary product checks and the environmental audits. I believe one can regard as only a modest success removal, by the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Food Safety, of the provisions in the directive that made it obligatory for environmental audits to be drawn up for the entire life cycle of a product. Differing demands continue to be made of manufacturers and importers, and the resulting problem of market distortions has not yet been resolved either. Although we have made a great deal of progress with this compromise package, the directive is still a bureaucratic nightmare for small businesses. From what I can see, the oft-repeated demand for consideration to be given to the interests of small and medium-sized enterprises is being reduced to an empty phrase. It would be the height of absurdity to add to a legislative text an article stating that small businesses must be given help with its implementation, when that text will, in all likelihood, turn out to be unworkable.

 Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I hope that you can hear me above the mounting background noise. Speakers deserve to be treated with a bit of respect in this Chamber! This report on the European Environment and Health Action Plan concentrates too much on chemicals. Too little attention is paid to many other things that have an adverse affect on human health. It is clear that there are risks associated with chemicals, but there is little point in drawing up blacklists and thus stigmatising certain substances such as phthalates. The report is based on an exaggerated interpretation of the precautionary principle. It talks about direct and total bans on certain substances without basing them on scientific findings, or without taking account of known scientific findings, as is customary with the precautionary principle. This report represents another attempt at a zero-risk policy, at what I call the ‘green disease’ prevalent in many western societies. We are trying to apply a comprehensive insurance mentality to environmental protection, forgetting that there are always risks associated with the development of an open society. The mere existence of a risk and widespread fear of chemicals are used to justify demands for total bans. Fear is nothing more than uncertainty arising from ignorance. If you want to counter fear, you must combat ignorance. To do that you need to promote science and research, and to draw the correct conclusions from your findings. We should not confuse risks with dangers that are actually present. The priority objective of environmental policy should not be to exclude risks, but to identify and eliminate dangers. The report also overshoots the mark when it comes to dealing with tobacco smoke. As long as tobacco is a legal product, we should hold back from demanding a total ban on smoking. It is not for Europe to determine where you can and cannot smoke. In the report we call for tobacco smoke to be designated a class 1 carcinogen, indicating that it has a proven and direct effect. I would like to remind you that there is as yet no scientific proof for that. I am not suggesting that the health dangers of tobacco smoke should be played down, but putting tobacco smoke in the same category as substances such as benzene or asbestos is nothing short of environmental populism. I also believe that we should be holding this debate in Brussels, not in Strasbourg.

 Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, a time bomb is ticking on Earth, and its name is Aids. For several years, the number of new infections has again been increasing at an alarming rate. This rise also includes Europe, with particularly Eastern Europe affected, both the new Member States and Russia. The majority of new infections involve young people aged between 15 and 25, and in particular women. A new carelessness has crept into their dealings with HIV and Aids. New medicines and therapies have improved the situation of HIV patients, so that the virus is losing its horror and thoughtlessness has become a way of life for many. Such thoughtlessness is lethal! The best protection against HIV is the use of condoms; this is a fact, and it should be supported and promoted by all sections of society. Abstinence is of course also a form of protection against Aids, but it should be left to individuals to decide whether they wish to practice abstinence or use condoms. Moral appeals are of no use in stopping the spread of the virus. Instead, we need encouragement for each person to act responsibly, both for themselves and for others. It is the job of politicians to create the conditions that enable as many men and women as possible to make this decision freely for themselves. The most important pillars of prevention are sex education without taboos and access to condoms, above all in schools and for young people. I am delighted that Commissioner Kyprianou placed particular emphasis on this. In many African and Asian countries, Aids is depopulating entire regions, for example South Africa, where over half of the population is infected with the virus. This is no longer merely a disaster in human terms, but also in economic terms. I should like to appeal to the EU Member States’ sense of responsibility and the commitments they have already entered into. We welcome the fact that some Member States, for example the United Kingdom, Sweden and the Netherlands, have provided financial support for the international fund over and above what they committed themselves to. Unfortunately, some of the other Member States have either not met their commitments at all, or only in part. Aids is one of the twenty-first century’s global challenges. Above all, it is the task of the Western societies to put up a fight against this epidemic. We need discussions without taboos in Western societies on new methods of prevention, as especially African and Asian societies are dependent on help from outside, or, to put it another way, from us.

 Mr President, Mahatma Gandhi said ‘The greatness of a nation and its moral progress can be judged by the way it treats its animals.’ The welfare of laboratory animals is an important and delicate subject that many people would like to ignore. However, it is a very sensitive issue, in particular when it comes to research using monkeys and especially great apes. We know that this is the case from the public reaction. The Commission was subjected to great pressure. I would like specifically to thank Commissioner Dimas. You have done some very good preparatory work and you have introduced important improvements in the welfare of laboratory animals, such as prior authorisation and follow-up checks for all tests. You have extended the directive to cover all animal species, not just mammals. The Commission has also effectively resolved the highly controversial issue of tests on non-human primates. These tests have been restricted to life-threatening illnesses and brain diseases. Unfortunately, many details of the Commission proposal have been amended by the votes in the committees. For instance, the standards that I have just referred to have been turned on their heads by the vote in the Committee on Agriculture and Rural Development. To give just one example, following the vote in the Committee on Agriculture and Rural Development, tests will be automatically authorised if they have not received official authorisation after 60 days. This is an indefensible situation for us in Europe. This is why I am calling on my fellow Members to read through what you are voting on tomorrow and not just to follow your voting guidelines. I am grateful to the rapporteur for being prepared to make some compromises at the last minute. I am pleased that Mr Parish plans to introduce an oral amendment tomorrow to ensure that the rules on the authorisation period for projects are made clearer. However, it is a pity that Article 15 has not got through. Article 15 gives some Member States the option of retaining stricter standards, as is the case, for example, in the Netherlands. Why do we want to lower the standards which are currently very high in the Netherlands? Our joint aim must be to find a balance between high levels of animal welfare and intensive research. I have had enough of the knock-out argument, which is always trotted out, that research will move abroad. This is not necessarily always true. Schopenhauer said ‘Any stupid boy can crush a beetle, but all the professors in the world cannot create a new beetle.’ We must provide a set of values, because that is our job.

 The legal basis used, Article 13(1) of the EC Treaty, is not appropriate considering that, in the opinion of the German Free Democratic Party (FDP), the principle of subsidiarity is not being observed. It is not within the remit of the EU legislator to lay down the regulations in question, thereby seriously encroaching on the self-determination of the Member States.  Combating discrimination of all kinds and bringing about participation in public life by the disabled are important jobs. Proposing to extend the anti-discrimination regulations to practically all areas of life is out of touch with reality, however. The reversal of the burden of proof laid down in the directive will mean that it is possible to open legal proceedings on the basis of accusations not backed up by sufficient evidence. Those affected would then have to pay compensation even if they have not actually committed any acts of discrimination but are unable to prove their innocence. Defined in this sweeping way, this reversal of the burden of proof is therefore questionable from the point of view of its compatibility with acting as a state under the rule of law. It will create uncertainty and facilitate abuse. That cannot be the raison d’être
 of a progressive anti-discrimination policy. A further consideration must be that the Commission is currently pursuing infringement proceedings against numerous Member States in relation to inadequate transposal of the existing European directives on anti-discrimination policy. There is as yet, however, no overview of those regulations that have been transposed so as to make it possible to determine the need for new regulations that has been claimed. Germany, in particular, has already gone far beyond previous stipulations from Brussels. We therefore voted against this report.

Mr President, Commissioner Verheugen, once again we are meeting to discuss the subject of cars, and rightly so. This crisis has hit one of our key industries very hard. A total of 12 million jobs, 6% of the work force, the largest investor in research and development – this makes discussing the problem and finding solutions very much worthwhile. However, it has now become clear that the EU does not have suitable instruments available to deal with this crisis. The Member States are pressing ahead individually, the framework for competition has at times been put at risk and the European Investment Bank, the universal cure-all, is overstretched both in terms of its finances and its staff. Therefore, we need to find new approaches. I am grateful to Commissioner Verheugen for adopting this framework directive very quickly in order to investigate how we should proceed in the context of competition law. However, the EIB needs to be better equipped. The EIB needs to be offered special conditions by the European Central Bank to allow it access to fresh capital, which is not currently permitted by law. It is also important that state aid is more closely linked to the paradigm shift towards new technologies and away from the internal combustion engine. In addition, funds, such as the Structural Funds and the agricultural funds, should be focused on developing stronger infrastructures for these new technologies. I would like to look more closely at General Motors. I agree with the Commissioner and the previous speakers that this has a European dimension, because the company has sites in many of the Member States of the EU. The bottom line, however, is that the state, including the EU, should not intervene in the economy. The crisis has not changed this principle. Although the car industry is a strategic sector, it is not systemic in the same way as the banking industry. Therefore, we should avoid taking shareholdings in the car industry. However, I believe that guarantees are the right approach, if there is a private investor to take on a guarantee via the EIB. This assumes that we are following the paradigm shift and moving into new technologies. Daimler and the Abu Dhabi Investment Authority have recently taken this type of step, so it should also be possible for us. I would like to thank the Commissioner for taking such active measures. I would also like to thank my fellow Members for supporting the initiative involved in this resolution.

 Madam President, Commissioner, I would like, first of all, to congratulate Mr Schwab on the compromise that he has produced in collaboration with the Council. Not every issue was covered, but that is the way with compromises. The introduction of mandatory safety systems for vehicles is something I particularly welcome. The mandatory introduction of new safety technology such as ESP will mean that, in future, it will not only be those who buy premium cars who will benefit from a higher standard of safety on the road, but also the drivers of goods vehicles. In doing this, we are making a crucial contribution to the safety of Europe. This must also unconditionally apply to tyre safety. It is right to clearly class the wet grip, and thus the safety, of tyres as more important than rolling resistance, which helps reduce CO2
 emissions. Tyres’ rolling resistance, depending on the driving conditions and speed, accounts for 20 to 30% of fuel consumption. It is therefore clear that, given the current environmental debate and in order to reduce petrol costs, a reduction must be achieved. However, it is necessary to realise that, without rolling resistance, which occurs through the deformation of tyres and their elastic properties, safe and comfortable driving would be impossible. We therefore have to see safety in another light here, too. The new developments by the tyre manufacturers show that it is possible to have both safety and lower rolling resistance. In this way, we will also enable the European motor industry to take, and retain, a world lead. The compromise motions that we will be voting on tomorrow send a clear signal away from the CO2
 hysteria and towards greater road safety.

 Madam President, Commissioner, small and medium-sized enterprises have never been as important as they are today. SMEs are particularly important against the background of the economic and financial crisis, which was caused by the large rather than the small enterprises. SMEs are important because they too will soon be suffering, yet they are responsible for much of our economic performance. In the country I know best, SMEs account for 20% of all patents, 40% of all gross investment, 49% of total turnover, 70% of all workers and 80% of all trainees. What is needed now is a rethink. We must press the large reset button, as it were. We must promote entrepreneurial mindsets – this is what the Small Business Act stands for. I should like to congratulate Mrs Herczog on this report. It is indeed important that we now describe and regard SMEs as a cross-section, that we rethink support measures, that we give precedence to small enterprises in public tenders (‘Think Small First’) and that we prevent public authorities from intervening in competition. I congratulate you, therefore; what are needed now are tax cuts for labour-intensive sectors.

 Mr President, many thanks to Mr Parish for his question, and thank you also to the Commissioner for his answer. Europe has many things that are envied around the world: our fashion, our lifestyle, our social-security systems – and, increasingly, our diet. We in Europe would do well to draw attention to the healthiest diet, namely the Mediterranean diet. To clarify the definition: the Mediterranean diet has its origins in the dietary patterns typical of large parts of Greece, including the island of Crete, and of southern Italy – hence its name. Its main component – as the Commissioner has already said – is olive oil. This is yet another reason – and I address this not only to Commissioner Špidla but also to the whole of the Commission – to accord this original European product even greater protection. The Mediterranean diet still consists of high-fibre bread, large amounts of fruit and vegetables – which is why we welcome the Commission’s School Fruit Scheme – fish, dairy products in moderation, and wine too. It has been scientifically proven – this conclusion was reached in a September 2008 edition of the British Medical Journal
 – that the Mediterranean diet helps to reduce the incidence of cardiovascular diseases, of type 2 diabetes – the contemporary European epidemic – and of cancer, and to decrease the effects of Alzheimer’s disease and Parkinson’s disease. This is illustrated by a visit to graveyards in Crete, the island my father hails from: seeing the age people live to there really brings this home to you. Therefore, we must do our utmost to increase the number of devotees of the Mediterranean diet in Europe and beyond, and its inclusion on the World Heritage List is an important step in this regard. I wish to thank the Commission for its efforts. However, we must also realise that, if China and India adopt the American diet, as they are increasingly doing, the adverse effects will be threefold. Firstly, the health of the world’s population will decline. Secondly, there will be an increase in intensive livestock farming, with all its adverse effects on the environment, and the third effect concerns methane production, as most of the meat will be beef. Cattle produce methane, and that is bad for the global climate. This is why it is so important to take this particular step. Thank you again, Mr Parish.

Madam President, the agreement on the climate package is a modest result. The EU has set a reduction target of 20% compared with 1990. We have already managed just under half the reduction. The keyword is expansion to the east, where emissions are lower in absolute figures, leaving a reduction target of 12% compared with 1990. The EU should achieve 3% to 4% of the reduction in developing countries, leaving just under 9%. Targets can be missed by up to 5%. That leaves 4%. Normally one should say at this point, good, how lucky, the EU has decided not to export its entire economy to Asia. The compromise is clearly cheaper than the Commission proposal. That allows the German Free Democratic Party (FDP) to agree. Instead, the EU is now playing its own Member States off against each other; as a result of the energy mix, exemption rules and crafty negotiation, some Member States have an advantage over others. We could soon see German energy suppliers generating electricity in Poland rather than in Germany, unless they buy it from the French. The fact that the EU Member States are engaged in such horse-trading leaves little expectation of a global agreement and the question of efficiency of resources also arises. Governments, the Council and the EU Commission are called upon to provide for efficiency both for environmental protection and for the economy and growth.

Mr President, this part of the climate package is one of the most important parts, because the automotive industry lies at the heart of the economies of many of our Member States. That is why this chapter had to be closed now, so that the automotive industry can focus on the crisis plaguing it and will not need to keep battling with what figures it must or can achieve. We need security of planning and this package gives us security of planning. It is a now-or-never package. It is a now-or-never decision, because if we do not get it through now, if we were to go now to second reading, then we would not get an automotive regulation. For this reason and because it is a special omen, I should like to congratulate Guido Sacconi. It was not easy, when he took over as rapporteur for this difficult part, to strike a balance here. He has managed to do so. I have to say, I have the highest respect for your work, because you have managed in this report to create incentives for industry but, at the same time, to introduce fines which, as Werner Langen said, are perhaps a little high, but which achieve a paradigm shift, which is precisely what we need here. We cannot keep pummelling away at the automotive industry by saying you have not achieved your own targets. What about when the automotive industry developed the Smart car, the Lupo, the A2, and no one bought them? Cars in showrooms do no good whatsoever. However, now we are in a phase in which, as a result of the economic situation and as a result of the legislation we are preparing here, the transition to a new era of mobility can be achieved. That is why I believe that this is not a watering down; it is a paradigm shift that we have before us and that we have helped to bring about, and this paradigm shift will also go down in history alongside the name Stavros Dimas. I should like to thank the Commissioner for his stubbornness, for his obstinacy, because that is ultimately what brought about this result.

Mr President, Commissioner Kallas, I would like to start by congratulating the rapporteur warmly. She has put in a huge amount of hard work, which is a rare occurrence these days. OLAF is a very special body within the EU: an independent anti-corruption agency which is the envy of other international organisations. It was this Parliament – as explained by Mr Bösch and Mr Rübig – which, following bad experiences with OLAF's predecessor, insisted on the independence of the new Anti-Fraud Office. We should remember that, at the time, OLAF was only allocated or linked to the Commission for practical reasons. Unfortunately, for many people the memories of the scandals of 1999 have already faded, along with any respect for the necessary independence of an anti-corruption authority. From today's perspective, the existing safeguards are no longer sufficient to protect OLAF from the exertion of influence and, above all, from increasing blockades. Let us be clear about one thing right from the start: OLAF is there to combat fraud. It is a body which ensures that taxpayers' money is used appropriately. Therefore there are five points which we are supporting by means of this report to promote OLAF's independence: Firstly, the right of the General Director to intervene in cases heard by the European Court of Justice. This right ensures that OLAF can consistently defend the results of its investigations. The second important guarantee is the right of the supervisory committee, the Commission or another body to bring a case before the European Court of Justice if OLAF's independence is jeopardised. This sharp sword is necessary because warnings from the supervisory committee have simply been ignored in the past. Thirdly, OLAF's independence is also guaranteed by its obligation to bring before the courts the facts of a case which could constitute the elements of a crime. The fourth point is the importance of the skills and strength of character of the people responsible. Fifthly, I am pleased that the Director General of OLAF is being reappointed. Experience and performance are both important here. We should try to avoid denigrating OLAF. The experiences of other anti-corruption authorities show that this does not help anyone. However, I do agree fully with Mr Bösch that the Council must be involved. No French or Czech explanation for this is forthcoming. They are not even present and in the end the system simply cannot work like this.

 Madam President, Commissioner Verheugen has very impressively illustrated how the crisis spilled over from the financial market to the market in car sales. What is more, the reality of the situation is that confidence has evaporated and uncertainty prevails in respect of future regulation on CO2
. For this reason, I am only able to call on my fellow Members and the Council to come to a clear and reliable regulation in this area of CO2
 regulation for cars very quickly – on the basis of what has been put forward by the French Presidency, for which I can only congratulate you, Mr Jouyet. Yet the absolutely most climate-friendly car we could possibly want in Europe is worth nothing if it is in the shop window and not on the road. People do not just need to drive such a car, they have to be able to pay for it too. That is why we are calling for the following three-pronged approach. First of all, get new models on the streets. This requires lots of investment in research now, for which reason we welcome the European Investment Bank’s programme. Ecofin meets on 2 December – we hope that a decision will be made there that will bring about flexible, favourable credit flows in the motor industry. Secondly, the motor industry financial institutions must be safeguarded. We cannot do that here, at the European level – it must be included within the national rescue packages, which must remain open. Thirdly, we must have scrapping premiums in Europe. Italy has taken a lead in this area, as has Sweden, though perhaps not quite as impressively as Italy. This is how tax incentives can be used to get new models onto the streets. It would be good if no European barriers were put in the way on the basis of competition law. For that reason, it would also have been good if Mrs Cruz had been present. This is the route to a new way forward!

 Mr President, I should like to start by congratulating Mrs Grossetête. I also wish to thank the Commissioner for his speech, particularly the aspect of piracy and counterfeiting. A 300% increase over the last year is no small amount, and this also endangers the health of European citizens. Yet we must also think about where piracy originates, its sources. In this regard, we note that 80% of counterfeit products originate from Internet trade and only 20% from actual smuggling. This must be our starting point. In the case of the smuggled goods, we must mobilise our customs authorities, we must use new technologies, and we must look much more closely and thoroughly at how we can ensure safety in the case of blister packing, too. We must, of course, also ensure that there are safe Internet chemists and that citizens know which chemists are safe. I should also like to draw attention to new principles. We need a coherent approach based on the principle: ‘Know your supplier, know your client.’

 Madam President, Commissioner, once again – yet again – a Doha Round has failed. Is the WTO simply boring the world now? Certainly not! We really were almost at the point of agreement. There was not very much left to be done, but at the last moment, India and China – of all countries – caused the talks to collapse. That makes it very clear that the talks did not run aground for technical reasons but that the event had a political nature, as it shows that the new power centre of the world trade round is in Asia and no longer so much in Europe. China’s role is considerable, as China has so far always been committed to free trade, but suddenly it apparently has a new agenda. Nevertheless, I would like to extend sincere congratulations to the Commission – to you, Commissioner, and also to Commissioner Mandelson, on the positive role played by the EU. Unlike in Hong Kong, we were involved in the negotiations, were pro-active and were prepared to make compromises. It is rather a shame, though, that Mr Mandelson is leaving at this point; it means we have to change horses in midstream. He was a good negotiator. He hassled us a lot in Parliament, and he leaves big shoes for Lady Ashton to fill. All the best!

A pluralist media system is a fundamental prerequisite for the survival of the European model of a democratic society. The concentration of media ownership, however, creates an environment that is conducive to the emergence of monopolies, erects barriers to market entry and leads to uniformity of media content. The development of the media system is increasingly driven by the profit motive. If conflicts of interest between concentration of media ownership and political authority are to be avoided, competition and media law must be dovetailed. The fact is that such conflicts of interest damage free competition and pluralism. In order to strengthen pluralism, there is also a need to guarantee a balance between public and private broadcasters. In addition, I call for measures to improve the competitiveness of media groups in order to foster economic growth. European and national competition rules must be applied consistently so as to ensure keen competition and an open market. In particular, national media regulation must be transparent and efficient. For this reason I welcome the Commission’s intention to develop indicators to measure the plurality of the media. I also call for the creation of additional indicators to measure factors such as democracy and codes of conduct for journalists. Moreover, I believe that the provisions on media concentration should also regulate the means of access to Internet content and its dissemination.

Mr President, Commissioner, network security – it sounds like a specialised field of knowledge, but the security of networks is influencing more and more aspects of our daily lives: mobile communications, the Internet, which is squeezing its way, rather like an octopus, into more and more areas of everyday activity, ambient intelligence – the computer intelligence that is built into our environments, be it to assist elderly people or to control complex work processes. All of this shows us that we are becoming more and more dependent on such advanced forms of technology. They rule our lives and the growth of our economy. How dependent we have become was recently demonstrated in Estonia. You mentioned, Commissioner, that Georgia was affected too. People are less aware of that case, but if we had needed a more spectacular example than Estonia, we got it there. We saw how a modern, network-driven economy suddenly became dependent on that factor, on that technology, how it was attacked and how its security really did come under very serious threat. That is also the reason why the Commission, in which Commissioner Liikaanen held the portfolio at that time, rightly recognised the need for a network-security agency. This is why we were taken by surprise when ENISA was evaluated after only a year, before it was fully and properly resourced, and the agency’s very existence was called into question. That certainly shocked us at the time, and I am therefore delighted that we are conducting this debate here. Why did we call this agency into question after only a year? How do you intend, do we intend, to fashion ENISA’s mandate in such a way that it can operate like an agency that deals on equal terms with the agencies that exist in the United States, Japan and China? I should like to thank you for your recognition, following the second evaluation, of ENISA’s achievements. Nevertheless, day after day we Members of Parliament discuss this culture shift, this climate change that affects our economies, that forces us to give up our economic dependence on fossil fuels and switch to other energy sources. Every day we put our heart and soul into these efforts here. We all know that changing our systems is the only option. To that end we need intelligent solutions, and we need network security, for security is paramount. This is why I am grateful that we are holding this debate as a building block in the construction of a more robustly resourced ENISA and of greater network security.

Mr President, Commissioner, let me begin by expressing my thanks to Romana Jordan Cizelj whose report truly touched on all aspects of a modern industrial policy and stressed the particular importance of creating the right basic conditions. I am very grateful to her. We cooperated well on this report. In your explanatory statement, Mrs Jordan Cizelj, you say that, in general, industry in the EU is healthy and dynamic. Yes, we are even experiencing a renaissance of the so-called ‘old economy’. I myself come from a highly industrialised state. No one ever thought, for example, that the steel industry would suddenly boom again. We are a vibrant global force. The state of our industry is robust, and our flagship, the euro, has indeed steered us through the straits. Nevertheless, in spite of the sound industrial base and the resumption of investment activity in Europe, we note that the tide is turning. The speed of technological change is breathtaking. The question is how we should deal with this. Is this the right time to be conducting a mid-term review of our industrial policy? Without raw materials and cheap labour – neither of which we possess – we shall come under competitive pressure that we shall be unable to withstand unless we are creative. For this reason, I wish to congratulate the Commission first of all for having designated 2009 as the Year of Creativity and Innovation. Yet what does that mean? Innovation, as we know, must be far more effective in turning knowledge into wealth. We have established the EIT, the European Institute of Innovation and Technology – or, to be more precise, it will soon be established – and that is a good basis. Yet the creative people in the world are not only leaving Europe, they are now even quitting the United States. You should read the book by Richard Florida in which he reflects on this situation. What is happening with regard to the creative class in this world? Creative people will settle in places that fulfil three criteria, which Florida calls the three Ts – technology, talent and tolerance. The question is whether these three Ts are present in sufficient abundance here in Europe. I believe we have laid good foundations with the Seventh Framework Programme and the EIT, but that is not enough. We must do a lot more. The three Ts need more money. The clusters are a sound initiative. It is essential, however, to select the right specialisations; the cluster initiative must be coherent, as must the whole industrial policy of the EU, and it must be appropriate and balanced. In the case of the car industry, of course, we see some lack of consistency; we see that, in certain respects, we are overtightening the screw. That has to do with our policy on climate change, which is increasingly becoming a fanatical moral crusade, subjecting Europe to a form of lifestyle regulation that sometimes goes over the top. How else can it happen that CO2
 emissions from exhaust pipes are penalised 24 times more heavily than emissions from chimneys? We must ensure, Commissioner Verheugen, that the policy of the EU is coherent. We cannot be the lead market and possess an 80% share of global trade in premium cars and yet pull the rug from under our own feet in this very part of the market. We must take care to act consistently.

Mr President, President Maystadt, Mr Audy, ladies and gentlemen, I would first like to thank the rapporteur most warmly and congratulate him on the good, balanced work he has carried out. I congratulate the EIB on its successful activities and ambitious business plan. When it comes to energy and innovation, the EIB is helping the EU to implement its policy. Without the EIB we would not have got the CIP off to such a good start. The EIB’s strategy for 2007-2009 provides for reinforcement of the value added, the gradual increase in risk taking, the use of new financial instruments and the stepping-up of cooperation with the Commission. I heartily endorse this strategy. The evaluation of the activity by the EIB rapporteur and the suggested next steps are correct. However, we must not forget that the role of Parliament is limited. Although the EIB is one of the Community’s institutions, its power is exercised internally according to intergovernmental rules, which means that the Member States are the most influential shareholders. The European Parliament has been commenting on the EIB’s activity reports regularly since 1999 and this has developed into a close, trusting, successful relationship of cooperation. I would particularly like to praise the cooperation with President Maystadt, which is exemplary for relationships with other institutions.

Commissioner Potočnik, talking about the role of SMEs is the done thing in this House. Indeed, small and medium-sized enterprises are the backbone of the EU economy. In Germany alone, almost 20 million people are working, researching and developing in more than 3.3 million small and medium-sized enterprises. Whether Europe grows or stagnates mainly depends on them. Small and medium-sized enterprises produce more patents, innovations and jobs than the large conglomerates. Yet the SMEs continue to have too little access to loans and funding programmes. Eurostars is a good example of how things work. Unlike the Seventh Framework Programme, which is based on a top-down approach with central funding by the EU, Eureka and Eurostars are bottom-up approaches. The programmes are managed by the Eureka Initiative. This is a good thing, and could also perhaps be a model for our Seventh Framework Programme. The advantages of the Eurostars programme are as follows: •	research-intensive SME required in leadership role •	eligibility checking and evaluation by international experts •	harmonised invitations to tender and workflows in all Member States •	fast decision making regarding funding: 14 weeks after the cut-off date •	the Commission awards additional top-up •	funding exclusively in the form of non-repayable grants (cash allowance) I should like to congratulate the rapporteur warmly on his work. I wish the programme every success.

Mr President, Commissioner, I had a visitors' group here again today. It will be a familiar situation to many of my colleagues. We have visitors' groups, some large, some small, and the largest groups are from the silver generation. That was the case with the group today. There were 60 people, extremely interested, really engaged, very active, and this is increasingly the case. This is surely the challenge for Europe. Demographic change is often depicted as a threat. The figures speak for themselves. Between 2010 and 2030 the number of EU citizens aged between 65 and 80 is expected to rise by 40%. However, like Mr van Nistelrooij, I do not see this as a threat. I think it is a major opportunity for Europeans to show that we are the region of the world that is most committed to a high quality of life at every stage in people's lives and for every age group. We need to show more concern for the elderly, and we must ensure that we do so as the people of Europe, the region of the world that protects life. I would like to congratulate the Commission on this proposal. This Ambient Assisted Living (AAL) programme links this major trend, namely demographic change – which is more pronounced in Europe than in other regions – with our strengths in research and innovation. We are strongly committed to ICT technologies and AAL brings these two trends together. It is quite clear, ladies and gentlemen, that we have no direct competence, as the European Union, for standards relating to older people, building of houses, etc. However, using these pilot programmes, we can promote best practice and we can bring together what is already being done best by some Member States and give it a European seal of quality so that it genuinely serves as a model for others. Ladies and gentlemen, with this programme the Commission is helping to close the so-called digital divide between generations within our society. I would like to thank Neena Gill, the rapporteur, for having conveyed this message extremely clearly, much more than other rapporteurs, I must say. I would like to express my sincere thanks to her. She also defended Parliament's position very courageously in the trialogue and ensured that our arguments were conveyed effectively. There is no need for us to hide ourselves away. As a representative of this House, let me say that we wish the AAL programme the greatest success. Our very good wishes go with it.

Mr President, Commissioner, thank you for your contribution. The European Parliament welcomes this Fund. Commissioner Dimas, you have launched the right kind of initiative at the right time. If, as Europeans, we are committed to cutting CO2
 emissions, it does not matter where CO2
 is emitted. CO2
 emissions must be reduced all over the world, and that is why we have to apply the new technologies everywhere. However, I see this Fund as being not only a development instrument but also a strategic instrument. It is not just about providing development aid. Rather, Europeans must not only be trailblazers when it comes to the issue of climate change; we must also encourage others to join us on our journey. They must be able to follow the route we have taken. That is where I think this Fund can make a crucial contribution. If we set overly ambitious targets and end up isolated and alone, this will spell the end for our industrial base as well. That is why there is a need for global governance here. Bali was a good approach and Copenhagen will be another. However, in a global governance system, it is not only about power play; we must creative incentive systems and I believe that this Fund creates the right kind of incentive. Claude Turmes referred at the start of his speech to Martin Luther King's dream. As Europeans, we can only make our dream of saving the climate a reality if we pursue this path consistently. Claude Turmes, you will secure a very substantial majority in favour of this report tomorrow and I would like to congratulate you here and now on that achievement. I am very pleased for you.

Mr President, first of all my sincere congratulations to Reino Paasilinna, our rapporteur, as well as to Commissioner Figeľ. That we carried this off here in such a short time was truly a crowning achievement! The rapporteur has been diligent and circumspect and has very much included us all. 	 I should also like, however, to offer very particular congratulations here to the President of the Commission, Mr Barroso. We must indeed be very clear that this project was his own initiative in January 2005. We have got it up and running in three years. That is awesome. We are fast in Europe and this, it must be said at least once at this point, is a crowning achievement by us. It took only three years, although it was indeed a critical subject. We have to get involved through education. Education lies at the heart of cultural and educational sovereignty in the Länder
 of Germany, the country I know best and of course, the Member States are keeping a close eye on it. We have nevertheless managed to wangle a compromise. I refer to the finances. We wrestled for a long time over the question of where the money should actually come from. In addition, we managed to set the EU budget at the first attempt from beginning to end. In the past it was just: subsidy, subsidy, subsidy. You are familiar with the debates. Now, though, for the first time, it is: innovation instead of subsidy! That is awesome! I should like to thank my colleagues on the Committee on Agriculture and Rural Development very specifically, because they had to agree to and then make compromises here. 	 We have also been able to resolve disputes very quickly, such as the issues of how independent the EIT should be, how long the pilot phases should last, what the EIT’s relationship should be to the Seventh Research Framework Programme, cannibalisation and even what is referred to as the ‘EIT label’, i.e. the issue of whether everything should be shown on this label when a project is launched under an EIT flag. We have resolved all of this. Now to implementation. At present – as Commissioner Figel’ has said – the Governing Board is being prepared, and the European Parliament (thank you for including us) will be considering who will be sitting on the Board, because we regard this as very, very important. The subjects will also have to be selected, however. Mr Swoboda has just been addressing the subject of energy. In fact we should be focussing on Europe’s overall response to climate change as well as managing the EIT and therefore, for example, the issue of energy efficiency etc. However, we must also talk about the location. I still regard Strasbourg as a choice location. This has never been raised so clearly before, but we do have to address it once and for all. This building is a choice location for an EIT and for a European Research Council. Strasbourg could become ‘Scienceburg’, and we should all be taking up this cause.

Mr President, may I begin by thanking and congratulating my colleague Fiona Hall, who has come up with the right response to a very important and judicious fundamental initiative from the Commission. I must praise Commissioner Piebalgs for having put himself at the head of those who are committed to energy efficiency, because energy efficiency is undoubtedly one of the main sources of self-sufficiency with regard to energy supply. It is also a source of innovation, for if we do everything we are proposing in the report, we shall establish ourselves well ahead of the field, even on a global scale, in terms of innovation and the objectives of the Lisbon Process. Be that as it may, I am struck by the immoderate criticism of people’s lifestyles at some points in the report. Let me just cite one example: paragraph 16 baldly asserts that the Commission should take certain appliances off the market. A specific reference is made to patio heaters or Heizpilze 
– ‘heat toadstools’, as some people call them in Germany. Hysteria about climate change does sometimes bring out veritable totalitarian traits! We have just managed to evict smokers from cafés. I believe that was the right thing to do, and I have no problem with it. Many landlords have now acted shrewdly and have put up these patio heaters outside. A new culture has developed. People have started to have convivial evenings outside, where they can smoke, and now along come the European politicians, we few individuals here, and tell 490 million people how they can and cannot spend their leisure hours. We are trying to change lifestyles again. I do not think our citizens will put up with this for much longer. It is right that the aims of climate protection should be writ large, but we really must ask ourselves whether we should be seeking to regulate the details of people’s lifestyles. Or do we want to outlaw patio heaters at the Christmas markets that we know from Germany and – yes, Claude – from Luxembourg as well as from Belgium and Austria? We would all be well advised not to forget our fellow citizens and to avoid interfering in such a pleasant aspect of society as people’s personal lives.

Mr President, the matter I wish to raise follows directly on from what Mrs Ţicău has just said: the 2008 Year of Intercultural Dialogue. I agree with this and respect the fact that the Conference of Presidents has taken certain decisions, but I note with some regret that the religious representatives that are to speak here, with the exception of the Pope, all come from outside Europe. Do we not have enough religious leaders here in Europe who can be invited to address this House? I therefore believe that it would make sense, and indeed you have just touched on this, Romania being a large Orthodox country, to invite as speakers to this House not only the Pope and Protestant church leaders – for there is also an intercultural dialogue between Christians – but Orthodox representatives too. I would therefore request that you also consider extending an invitation to Ecumenical Patriarch Bartholomaios as part of this Year of Intercultural Dialogue.

) Mr President, Commissioner Verheugen, the report that we are discussing is in fact only a report on a report, namely that which was drawn up by the Commission on the motor car of the future. However, on 19 December the European Commission adopted a proposal relating to future permitted CO2 emissions from passenger cars. The public is therefore naturally interested to see how the European Parliament will react to this proposal and the extent to which the decisions taken by Parliament are consistent with others that have been adopted more recently. We have just been debating and voting on the report presented by my colleague Chris Davies and it is therefore important that we should also be consistent. I would like to say something about this at a later point, for the CARS 21 report also covers many aspects that have nothing whatsoever to do with CO2 emissions. It is very important that we should concern ourselves in this House with the subject of motor vehicles. Why? Because we have been discussing the Lisbon agenda for years now, and because all this while we have been debating the competitiveness of European industry. Here we have a sector where we really are competitive. In the premium market, for example, Europe has been setting the standard at international level. More than 80% of the world’s top-of-the-range motor cars come from Europe. The industry is one of the cornerstones of Europe’s economy and is also a key factor for European competitiveness. CARS 21 stands for Competitive Automotive Regulatory System for the 21st Century. This is a Communication from the Commission, which in 2005 set up the CARS 21 High Level Group in order to draw up proposals for a future regulatory framework for the EU automotive industry. The aim of this exercise was to identify the adjustments that would have to be made to the automotive industry in order to keep this sector competitive in the years ahead. It is not possible, at this point, to go into all the proposals that were made. However, the members of the European Parliament’s Committee on Industry, Research and Energy have drawn up a list of 89 of these. I cannot deal with them all here, but they relate to issues such as road safety, environmental protection, the internal market, global trade, research and innovation, and many other things besides. Let me just single out a few of the aspects involved. We need to complete the internal market for car tuning parts and spares, for example. It is unfair that German automotive tuning companies, for instance, are not allowed to sell products such as wheels in Italy because that country bans after-market tuning parts, while Italian manufacturers on the other hand can export to any country they choose, including Germany. Here Europe needs a proper internal market for tuning and spare parts and we also need equal safety standards for the automotive tuning sector. In addition, we need to introduce an EU-wide type-approval system, for there are blatant discrepancies in this area at the present time. Here is something else too: we need a more simplified system for regulating type-approval procedures for used vehicles acquired within the EU and elsewhere. Some national states have set high obstacles and built up a massive bureaucracy that makes it very difficult for dealers and private buyers of used vehicles. Europe needs a common regulatory system in this area. This will also be an important tool when it comes to fleet renewal. We are developing a climate-protection policy in many other areas and we need it here too, which means we need to adjust and adapt. Another important issue concerns research funding. The automobile industry needs more research money from the Member States. The growing number of mandatory targets, such as legislation on CO2 emissions, requires continuous adaptation on the part of the car industry. If Europe is to strengthen its position in this market, both the Member States and the European Union will have to invest far more in vehicle research, and not just in developing alternative drive systems but in other areas too, such as energy storage. We are already five to ten years behind our Asian competitors when it comes to research into storage battery technology. Now to the subject of CO2: in coordination with Chris Davies, the rapporteur for the Committee on Environment, Public Health and Food Safety, we have once again set out a number of central parameters. These are based on the concept of penalties instead of bans, with vehicle weight being a key parameter, but they are also centred on a realistic assessment of when the CO2 legislation can take effect. Parliament has decided that the target date should be 2015. We have also voted for the figure of 125 grams as the basic emission target. If I could now just make one comment to the Commission: the penalty that you have specified in your proposal is 15 times higher than that imposed on CO2 emissions from chimneys. This makes CO2 from vehicle exhausts 15 times more expensive than that which is emitted from chimneys. For this reason we require a realistic rating. What we have at present is too ambitious. I should like to express my thanks to those colleagues who helped put this report together.

Mr President, I should like to begin by thanking my fellow Members for this truly fair and open debate. It has been conducted on a high level and has covered the issues of climate protection, innovation and – as we have been aware of at all times, especially when it comes to our fellow Members from the GUE/NGL – job security. These are three areas where we all have to find common agreement. I should also like to express my thanks to Claude Turmes for his various clarifications and suggestions. However, I would like to say quite openly that I consider the remarks made by Mrs Liotard to be unfair. It is not all about running after some lobby group or other. It is about fighting fervently for a policy that represents a key market for us in Europe. Here I am fully behind the Commissioner and I am also fully behind you too, Claude. I would maintain that you have been unfair here, Mrs Liotard. It is not right that you should call this lobbyism. I would at this point just like to quote from the great German sociologist Max Weber, who said that politicians must have passion – and I am actually trying to show some of this now – but at the same time they must have a sense of responsibility and a sense of proportion. The latter sometimes seems to get lost in debates of this kind with all the hysteria about climate change. Keeping a sense of proportion means ensuring that the great objectives that we want to achieve are also feasible. I would now just like to mention my colleague Chris Davies, for I am just a little proud of him. There is no one in the ALDE Group who is greener or more ecologically minded than Chris Davies. Nonetheless, he has had the sense of proportion in his report to call for practical limits and deadlines. That is what all this is about: we should not be giving the people of Europe the run-around, but should be doing things that are really achievable. I am pleased to see that the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Food Safety adopted the report by a large majority. I also want to thank the members of the Committee on Industry, Research and Energy for having adopted this report by a fairly large majority and I hope that tomorrow many of the Members will vote for it here in this House.

Mr President, in vino veritas 
or, to quote Goethe, life is too short to drink bad wine. These sayings sum up the essential point of reforming the EU market in wine. What our report is about is the quality of European wine, which can certainly stand comparison with that of imports from the New World. So what is the status quo
? In 2006, wine production accounted for 5% of the total value of agricultural output in the EU. With 45% of the world’s vineyard surface, 65% of its production, 57% of its consumption and 70% of the volume of exports, European wine enjoys a leading position in the world market. In the world of wine, we are a global superpower! Accordingly, there was a need for action to consolidate our superpower status and particularly to raise the quality of our wines. The reforms that you proposed, Commissioner, included an immediate end to crisis distillation. I believe that many of the things you mentioned, such as private storage and the ending of export subsidies, must aid and, of course, the enhancement of wine with sugar, are central points of your proposals. We have to say, however, that they reflected a rather technocratic perspective from the outset, addressing questions such as whether there should be a link between sugaring and must aid. In my view this Parliament has negotiated quite a good compromise between North and South, given that their respective concerns have dominated this issue. In the Committee on Agriculture and Rural Development we struck a very, very good balance with our compromises. In this context my special thanks go to the rapporteur, Mr Castiglione, who made great efforts to broker compromises, and we managed to take account of everyone’s concerns. I believe we have moulded the initial technocratic solution into a new elegant shape. We have a balance between North and South. I also wish to thank you, Commissioner, for indicating in your speech that you essentially intend to follow this line. What are the main points? Besides the compromise that allows continued sugaring, another key aspect of our report is the protection of regional products. In the light of this quality drive for European wine, there is also a continuing need for national support measures, and these have been set at EUR 1.3 billion. We believe that these matters should remain part of the first pillar, so that payments can actually go direct to growers. In addition, there was a need to refer – and this, I believe, is one of our primary achievements – to the need to give special attention to designations of origin and geographical indications on labels. That is an extremely important issue in our view, because indications of the geographical origin of wines are, of course, a matter of intellectual property. That has to be protected, and I believe we have obtained a very good compromise on this point. The ALDE Group will support these compromises, that is to say the whole package of compromises, because we believe they constitute a good solution. We hope that the Council will now adopt our suggestions. The voice of the European Parliament is the voice of the people as well as the voice of the wine producers and consumers. We ask you, Commissioner, to fight for these things too in your dealings with the Council and in the public domain in general.

Madam President, Commissioner, to many observers, the WTO dispute between Airbus and Boeing is starting to sound like a never-ending saga. I am happy that you have at least shown us a light at the end of the tunnel. In my view, in order to be able to evaluate the current situation and provide a policy recommendation on how we should go forward, it is worth reviewing the background to the dispute once again, together with the economic development of these two aviation giants. The origins of the current situation lie primarily in the massive increase in international aviation, accompanied by strong competition between aviation companies, since the early 1990s. May I, at this juncture, expressly pay tribute to the Commission once again for what it has achieved here. Without the establishment of the common market for the aviation industry in the 1990s and the Europeanisation of agreements with overseas countries, the competitiveness – and thus the success – of Europe's aircraft companies would have been impossible to achieve. The competition was tough, however, and some aircraft companies went to the wall. The demand for ever more economical, safer, larger, faster and more modern aircraft assumed dimensions in the 1990s which ultimately left only two well-performing companies in the running: Airbus and Boeing. Real alternatives to them now only exist in the regional and business aviation sector. I am proud that Airbus has managed to reinvent itself as a European company. For the European economies, aviation is an immensely important factor, without which economic life as a whole would quickly fall apart. Against this background alone, the developed economies have a massive interest in ensuring that well-performing air transport options are available to them. The aviation industry was compelled to recognise this, but was unable to keep pace. Above all, it lacked capital and it lacked the safeguards that would enable it to take on the enormous risks and massive expenditure associated with the development process. As the dualism between Airbus and Boeing intensified in the industry, competition between the two inevitably increased as well. During periods of weak demand on the world economy, the price war between Airbus and Boeing has been, and remains, intense. To ensure that this contest did not spill over into a competition to secure the largest share of State aid, a groundbreaking agreement was forged early on, in 1992. In 2004, when times were hard for Boeing, the US broke that agreement and appealed to the WTO. The EU did not hesitate for long and sought the same remedy. Boeing also brought the case before the WTO. The WTO rules are very simple; we are familiar with them and they have been debated here in this Chamber. In my view, both sides now need to get back around the negotiating table. Both sides need to admit that their aircraft industry needs subsidies. That is especially true if we want to master the emerging problems of CO2
 avoidance, protection against noise pollution and the increase in air traffic. We are moving into new technological territory here, and the risks for capital providers are immense. I would like to caution the EU's representatives against taking Airbus's current strength as a pretext for tightening the screws on Boeing and the US too zealously. Less than a year ago, we would have had to hold a very different debate. That is why both sides now need a viable strategy. Years of dispute and games of hide-and-seek will not take our technology sites forward. However, moving forward is essential. The key word – CO2
 – has already been mentioned. I would ask the Commission not to misunderstand what I am saying. It is not about letting the US pull the wool over our eyes about hidden military subsidies and ensuing cross-subsidisation. Let us encourage the Americans to play an honest game. I am confident that we can then reach a mutually acceptable solution.

 Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, many thanks for finding the time to be present here this evening despite the late hour. Indeed, the issue under discussion is not just some unimportant, marginal one – it is the common agricultural policy. I would like to start by reminding the House what this common agricultural policy actually means to the vast majority of our nearly 500 million citizens. After all, it is with these citizens in mind that such plenary debates are held. Nevertheless, it can be noted in this regard that many citizens see the common agricultural policy first and foremost as an advertisement for the EU – but unfortunately an extremely bad one. Export subsidies, supposedly unfair trade with ‘third world’ countries, feed scandals, farmers’ protests, excessive subsidies, genetically modified plants – the number of negatively perceived issues relating to the common agricultural policy is immense and unfathomable. Misdemeanours in the common agricultural policy have contributed significantly to the EU’s poor reputation in many parts of Europe. Ladies and gentlemen, this reputation is not something that can be dismissed out of hand this evening. This report, however – provided the Council supports it – could put the common agricultural policy on a new course, one that is closer to the ideas of the majority of citizens. I should like to start by discussing the Commission proposal once more. It essentially comprises four elements: transparency, i.e. the publication of the names of the beneficiaries of agricultural payments; introduction of the possibility of suspending payments to Member States under the first pillar in the case of serious breaches in their management and control systems; shortening of the periods of time for Commission auditing if Member States fail to comply with their control obligations (exceptions to the so-called 24-month rule); and adaptation of implementing powers. In political terms, the proposals on transparency are certainly of outstanding importance to the EP. With these, the Commission is finally implementing the decision of the Council and Parliament on the 2007 budget. In general I warmly welcome this project, although the Commission proposal is rather late in coming, probably partly owing to the incorporation of further facts into the text. Commission implementing regulations on the EAFRD are already envisaging publication of the names of all beneficiaries of payments under the second pillar. The other funds too (European Regional Development Fund, European Fisheries Fund, Cohesion Fund) now all contain publication rules. The budgetary decision has meant that, in essence, transparency has ceased to be controversial: it is no longer a case of if
 but only of how
. Eleven Member States are already publishing all payments comprehensively. We need more transparency, therefore. The absence of transparency has allowed the emergence of rumours and campaigns of disinformation, which have harmed the CAP more than the odd actual error. The only problems are with the how
: after all, the Commission gives no details of the procedure and wishes to lay down all the more detailed provisions in implementing regulations. As we are looking at an intrusion on the right of self-determination over personal data, my report proposes some clarifications regarding which data are to be published and under what conditions. These expressly follow an opinion of the European Data Protection Supervisor. In spite of the desire for speedy implementation, data protection must be taken very seriously – and the European Parliament is doing so. The objectives of this report are as follows: greater transparency, and at the same time clearer data protection requirements. In addition, the general public must be informed. How can this balancing act be achieved? In my view, it is essential to inform those concerned in advance, and there is no transparency unless the figures mean something. Therefore, I propose differentiating more clearly, for example according to intervention purpose. My report proposes name, payment and place of residence/registered office. Nowadays, transparency means publication on the Internet. We are talking about the creation of a general Internet platform with links and references by the Commission. It is up to Member States to make the information comprehensible by means of the relevant explanations. Member States are permitted to publish the information at regional level, too, if they consider this appropriate. Different databases must be linked. In the Council, the issue of who publishes the information was very controversial. The financial management is mixed, so the Member States have clear responsibility – including under Article 53b of the budgetary decision. In addition, publication by the Commission would give rise to problems of legal protection, as persons affected by incorrect publication would have to go straight to the European Court of First Instance. This is neither citizen friendly nor particularly transparent. The Commission proposal is simpler, more transparent, less cumbersome to administer and more citizen friendly, and therefore has my support. It is in line with the provisions in all the other fields (the Structural Funds and the rules applying hitherto to the second pillar). As the publication of the information is to be seen in the context of budgetary control, my report proposes a (moderate) flat-rate fine for cases of failure to publish information. On the subject of penal reductions in funding, I would say that I am broadly in favour, but there are some points where I should like to see greater regard for the principle of proportionality. In the Committee on Budgetary Control, my fellow Member Mr Mulder made proposals concerning the budgetary dimension of the dossier, which I can wholeheartedly endorse. In the Opinion of the Committee on Budgets, the committee expressed its views on the transparency aspects, and these largely correspond with my proposals. Ladies and gentlemen, and particularly members of the Council, this report was adopted unanimously in the Committee on Agriculture and Rural Development. I hope for a large majority in tomorrow’s vote, too. I implore the Council and the Commission to take this vote by the representatives of the European people seriously. There will also no doubt be a correlation between this report and the way all those involved deal with it, and the expected Health Check. We will undoubtedly return to this subject when we deal with the Health Check.

Mr President, first of all, thank you to both Vice-President Verheugen and Commissioner Kuneva for being here and enhancing the debate. If commercial and economic policy has a truly important task, it is where the safety of our children is concerned. Children’s toys have become increasingly inexpensive in recent decades and the cheaper the toy, the greater the likelihood that it was not produced in the EU. I have to say even as a Liberal that there is justifiable doubt that parents always know best what is good for their children when buying toys. The range is colossal and unmanageable. Quality toys produced in Europe such as Lego, Playmobil, Märklin, Brio wooden trains or Wader plastic toys are also correspondingly expensive. Competition needs people who can and want to take responsibility. Anyone who buys their children the cheapest junk toys untested does not want this responsibility! We also have to consider whether the Commission should launch an information campaign for parents like these. Yes, I am in favour of free trade, but not at any price! As Europeans, we have certain standards, and – this has been repeatedly addressed here – we have to implement them in a clearer way. At this point I should like to highlight once again the ‘Made in …’ campaign. Following the current events, it may be time to introduce a mandatory designation of origin, at least for toys. I know Commissioner Kuneva’s efforts on this issue and can only encourage her in them. The label on the product must be sufficiently large. Even though we are not in a position to change production conditions in China, this would at least educate citizens about this to a sufficient level.

Mr President, first of all I would like to thank Mr Paasilinna for his very effective cooperation. It was a very difficult piece of work, but you were always prepared to cooperate. I would also like to thank the Commissioner for the tenaciousness he has shown over many months and the loyalty he has shown to the project. You will see, Commissioner, that your persistence will pay off in the end, despite all the resistance you have experienced, right from the very beginning, especially from the scientific world. Since President Barroso was obviously inspired by the MIT and sowed the idea of creating a European institute of technology, this idea, this project, has been transformed. Today it looks different from the original version. This is just as well, because at the outset we were still somewhat vague as to the structure. A European project has now emerged and something new has evolved. We are a continent of ideas. We know that. We are very good at research; we are very good at science; but where we have difficulty is in converting these wonderful ideas that have revolutionised the world into tangible products. That is our problem. Therefore, when it comes to defining research as financial investment in knowledge, innovation would be the reverse process. Out of knowledge comes a product, a licence, a patent, which turns back into money again. This is our weakness in Europe and it is precisely here that the EIT, the European Institute of Technology, can help. It goes without saying that this regulation text is not an unqualified success. This we can say straight away. But it is a good compromise and it is now up to us to take it to the people and particularly to clarify it with those involved. The rapporteurs have been working very well together. We should not lose sight of the great objective in its entirety because the target audience of this EIT is small and medium-sized enterprises specifically. The aim is also to access knowledge at university institutions, but it mainly involves this networking process, which is not working so well for us. I would like to respond to a few controversial points. The Commission is proposing that it should set the EIT’s strategic agenda itself. To this I would say we should not be doing so. There must be autonomy here, too, as for the European Research Council. Otherwise the private sector has little chance. The question of intellectual property then needs to be dealt with in such a way that it also becomes attractive for a medium-sized enterprise to participate in the EIT. Of course we need an EIT, which is a brand and has a brand name. We want a strong EIT and we do not just want a pilot project either because that would deter many investors, and we need investors. Let me say something else about financing. I have been personally addressing the subject of the ‘Lisbonisation’ of our budget for some time now. This means we can ‘Lisbonise’ the large budget that we have in the sector of agricultural and regional policy and we are evidently at a point where we are talking about the subject of Galileo and EIT being lumped together. This is already coming very close to ‘Lisbonisation’, namely that we are investing in innovation. Therefore: let us get on with it. I call upon Parliament to endorse this compromise tomorrow with a large majority. Congratulations to you once again, Mr Paasilinna, on your work.

Mr President, Commissioner, ‘milk is good for you’ and today everyone is talking about it. Milk is the oldest energy drink in the world, it is a particularly important product, and it is good that we are debating it today. What we call the mini milk package, made up of three documents, is only one, albeit very important, building block in the further simplification of EU legislation in agriculture, and in principle the Commission’s reform and simplification measures in this connection are most welcome. As we know, reforming the Common Agricultural Policy is a long-term, continuous process and the proposed mini milk package is a step in the right reform direction. Rome was not built in a day, however. The Commissioner knows that better than anyone. I would like to address an important political aspect that some colleagues have already discussed: school milk. Here the Committee on Agriculture and Rural Development has called for an increase from EUR 16.11 to EUR 18.11 per 100 kg. That is a sensible correction and we were right to call for it. Perhaps we could now seriously consider a school fruit programme, which would probably also please the Commissioner’s colleague, Mr Kyprianou. I also welcome the standardisation of the protein content of milk and milk production because it allows European producers to enter into fair competition with their third-country competitors, given that competition is a basic liberal concern. At the same time it is right, important and also urgently necessary for milk producers and dairies to pool their resources even more, so that it becomes even easier for them to assert their interests on the market. A good deal of work on the ground is still required here too. Let me put forward an idea from the consumers’ point of view, and looking towards the future. The demand for milk has risen worldwide. It is particularly clear that living and eating habits are changing in Asia as a whole, i.e. demand is rising and prices are rising. It is a pity that the higher prices are attributable above all to trade. Yet we must also be honest with our citizens. To some extent the higher prices tell the environmental truth. For instance, it is not comprehensible that a litre of milk now costs less than a litre of water. Butter is cheaper now than it was 20 years ago. We certainly must tell the citizens that there are of course also some improvements. The money should remain in the sector, however, and not go to trade. A word on the quota. Evidently we will still have the quota for some time. That has been debated here and the reasons for having that quota have been given. Yet the current milk quota must expire in March 2015, and not just for German farmers who could then profit from the rising global demand for milk and products. What the Commissioner said when she was thinking out loud of considering actually raising the quota could be taken to mean it needs removing. We should be honest here and call for its removal. I thank Mrs Jeggle for what was, on the whole, a very good report. I wish the Commissioner all the best on the way to further reforms of the agricultural policy.

Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, the images of the serious fires in Greece haunted us throughout the entire summer. The swift assistance provided by other EU countries to tackle the fires and the EU’s current offer of assistance payments will not be forgotten in Greece. However, there is something that has been forgotten in Greece for decades, and this brings me to the cause of the recent disaster: namely the need to set up a land register. Greece has been obliged by the EU to act here for some time, but no action has been taken yet. As a consequence, large areas of the Greek forest have remained common land, in effect a no-man's-land. Anyone who burned a section of forest and put a cabin on it could be certain that there would be no comeback; indeed, his action would be legalised after the fact. This situation has made arson the national sport. The EU is willing to help the Greek people now, but Greece must take a good look at itself and if necessary give itself a rap on the knuckles. Specifically, this means that if Greece does not complete its land register by 31 August 2008, not only will the penalties accumulated – which run into millions – finally be due; other payments must be considered as well. As the rapporteur for the transparency of agricultural expenditure in the EU, I will be following this very closely.

 Madam President, first of all I would like to thank the rapporteur, who has truly set new standards in cooperation. Never before have I experienced such excellent cooperation, and I congratulate him on this. I would like to thank the Commission for producing this report and for its integrated approach. It is high time. As Europeans – and this I say from the perspective of the Committee on Industry, Research and Energy – we have a lot to offer in the field of marine policy. We are market leaders in the maritime clusters, we top the world league with our shipyards, 40% of merchant fleets are in European hands, and around 35% of marine equipment is supplied from the EU. Another thing we are good at is research. Blue biotechnology is a technology of the future for obtaining energy from the sea, and the outlook for reducing CO2 emissions is also good. Unfortunately we do not speak with one voice. It is therefore good that we have made this start. The package that you want to finalise, Commissioner, is something we are expecting with great anticipation. The world is watching us because it expects something from us. We look forward to an excellent package.

Mr President, I feel it is appropriate to begin by expressing Europe's support for the flood victims in China. Our fellow Member, Mr Markov, has raised an extremely important question, for which I would like to thank him on behalf of the Committee on International Trade. The EU and China are two of the oldest cultures in the world. On the one hand we have the largest trading bloc and on the other the fastest growing economy in humanity's history. So this is definitely an issue that needs to be addressed outside the WTO: an issue that requires a bilateral approach and a bilateral agreement. Both sides have a great deal at stake. We should not allow ourselves to be pressurised by the USA. So I would like to thank Commissioner Mandelson for refusing to adopt a common WTO strategy for dealing with China on the subject of pirate goods. Both sides – China and the EU – have both interests and instruments to protect against and to allow abuses of intellectual property rights: anti-dumping and anti-subsidy measures. What matters is how we deal with one another – how we use those instruments. The Commissioner has said that reciprocity is vital, and I would agree. We Europeans benefit from the fact that China has adopted our continent-wide European patent laws wholesale. That is a good thing. But having the laws is not enough: the rights must be enforceable and they have to be enforced. It is also in China's own interest to do so, though – you know that the Chinese company Heier will soon have an interest in protecting its own patents. Which proves that China does need this strategy. What should we do in the meantime, though? We are threatened with a very hostile scenario, whereby the Chinese apply for patents that are similar to ours, then close their market. They have already proved that it can be done. Thanks to the former President of the European Patent Office, Mr Pompidou, in around four years' time, China will actually have overtaken us in terms of the number of patents. I think we should link the patent issue to the EU's climate protection targets. That is right, with our climate protection targets! Let me explain why: China is a win-win culture, a culture that strives to achieve harmony. So I think that if we have something to offer, we may succeed. China is currently experiencing massive environmental problems. Social stability is threatened; the government is under great pressure because of huge environmental problems. At both the IPPC Conference and the G8 summit, China indicated that it wants to work towards the climate protection targets. Yet in many areas China lacks the technology. So our offer could be that we will support a CO2-free coal-fired power plant with our technologies, as a gesture, but in return we can demand that our patent rights be respected. Commissioner, you are on the right track. Thank you very much for the information that you have provided today.

 Madam President, Commissioner, Mr Vidal-Quadras, we are all agreed on the objective: we want to create a single European internal energy market. We want that in the interests of both consumers and undertakings. Where this did not work, where the market failed, we needed to show the yellow card, and in some cases even the red one. You have done that with your proposals, Commissioner, and the rapporteur has taken them up. The aim is therefore clear. It cannot lie in the break-up of the undertakings in the internal market, however. That is why we must work towards greater market integration, more investment in interconnectors, non-discriminatory market access for competition. And that is where we have now had a reaction. I am glad, we are all unanimously glad about the proposal for the creation of regional markets that is now on the table. There are to be seven of them. These regional markets will be responsible for network access, system safety, provision of capacity, control energy, network expansion and congestion management. This will require EU legislation. We hope that you will approach these tasks with the same courage as you showed with the existing proposal.

Mr President, Mr Gloser, Commissioner, let me begin by warmly thanking the rapporteur, Rodi Kratsa-Tsagaropoulou, for her report. The section on MEDA in particular has been very well formulated and highlights all the steps that will have to be taken. Congratulations on a truly solid piece of work! In the light of events and since time is short, I intend to confine myself to TIM, the aid fund for the Palestinians. The draft report shows clearly that the Commissioner has pulled off a real master stroke here. I congratulate you on that, Commissioner, because the EU had been compelled to call a complete halt to its aid payments to the Palestinian Authority. We had no option. We cannot assist terrorists. We never have done in the past, and we never should. There is always a duty to act, however, when individual suffering occurs. With TIM the European Union has found a solution that meets the high moral standards applied by Europeans to the payment of aid. In these circumstances, I believe that, while criticism of minor accounting errors and inaccuracies should be noted, it certainly must not be made the focus of this debate. After all, we are dealing here with a project that was put together somewhat hastily. We all know that we were subject to certain constraints. I do not agree with the critical undertone regarding the Israeli strategy of suspending the release of tax revenue. We cannot blame the Israelis for not having run after the terrorists with the money, and for that reason we should let the matter rest. Besides, subsequent events have shown that it was right to keep back the money as security, since it can now doubly benefit President Abbas and the forces of moderation. In this context I must also commend Israel’s decision to open the Erez border crossing on humanitarian grounds, thereby directly helping the Palestinians who were fleeing from Hamas. In conclusion, let me express my gratitude to the aid workers on the ground, for aid has to be delivered to the local people. The European Parliament is grateful for the humanitarian mission they are accomplishing. Theirs is no easy task. Our sincere thanks go to them.

 Mr President, Commissioner, I should like to start by thanking Mr Hökmark for his excellent cooperation. We have worked out various compromises together. The development mentioned by Mr Hökmark in his report covers all the relevant technical areas in the field of broadband. He covers all aspects excellently; the most important being developments in rural areas, of course – where we can see a great divide. Basically, we can speak of the ‘broadband paradox’: urban areas, where broadband is not actually necessary, have a high proportion of broadband users, whereas rural areas do not. We must therefore find ways of increasing the proportion there. We have also discussed the ‘digital dividend’. In the European frequency landscape, frequencies are becoming free that can be used for mobile broadband solutions. However, we must also discuss the major task of who should develop the relevant infrastructure and how to deal with the private operators investing in this and expecting a return on their investment. As a Liberal I would willingly leave everything to the market, of course – and I know that Mr Hökmark, too, has a liberal soul – but we must also recognise that this is not happening in rail transport or education, and so even the Liberals have to admit that other ways must be found of obtaining investment in this. A bonus system has been mentioned. I am glad that the report leaves this option open and allows this kind of bonus as a means of bridging the broadband gap, particularly in rural areas. I felt like calling out to Commissioner Kroes, who is now responsible for competition, that not everything can be looked at from a entirely puristic, theoretical angle. Sometimes, particularly in a world developing rapidly at global level, it is necessary to abandon introspection and adapt our competition rules to global conditions. This is a small field where we can do so. For this reason, I am particularly pleased that support policy is being changed, that resources from the European Regional Development Fund and the European Agricultural Fund can be used for the development of infrastructures. What is even more important as regards competition policy, however, is technology neutrality: in this regard the Commissioner has taken the right course – on which I also congratulate Commissioner Reding. There is one further aspect I should like to address. The development of broadband infrastructure in Europe can only be achieved by having a ‘man on the moon’ objective. In my opinion, this objective could consist in enabling the maximum number of people possible to vote by e-mail in the 2009 European elections. This would exert pressure on Member States to achieve participation of 25% or perhaps even more of their population in this wonderful instrument, which will take Europe forward. E-mail voting for the 2009 European elections – I believe that would be a significant new challenge! Once more, thank you for the constructive cooperation I have enjoyed.

 Madam President, Commissioner, I should like to start by congratulating Mr Gierek, who has presented a truly excellent report. It is good that we are discussing innovation, and it is good that we have used the broad concept of innovation – something that has been neglected for years. For much too long, we have concentrated solely on research itself rather than on implementing its results – but here, at long last, we have a report that does concentrate on this. The broad concept of innovation also represents an opportunity for us to achieve dominance in new fields. One example is the discussion on climate change, in which Europe is indeed creating new innovation areas, particularly by focusing on CO2 reduction. I think this is a very good thing, and it is also mentioned frequently in the report. I should like to illustrate what this means using the example of the motor-vehicle market, where we have a strong position, where we are even leaders in the premium sector at international level. It means that we can indeed set ourselves ambitious objectives – that is not the problem. After all, we are talking about reducing the CO2 from exhaust fumes. What we also have to do, however, is to follow up these objectives with research projects, and focus on them. This is still something of a weak point for us. We can set ourselves ambitious objectives; but, if we are to create model markets, we really have to follow them up. I could also mention the EIT, the new European Institute of Technology. This is a good thing. I should like to offer my personal congratulations to the Commissioner for taking the initiative in the form of the CIP, the framework programme for competitiveness and innovation, which is now to be followed by its own innovation agency. This is an excellent initiative! Parliament – and I, in particular, as a former rapporteur – will support you on this. One final word on the Lisbon process. Let us replace the phrase ‘Lisbon process’ with ‘Liverpool process’. Tonight, Liverpool are playing Milan. Two years ago, they came back from 3-0 down. That is how far behind Europe is at the moment. We have fallen behind, so we have to catch up. This is possible, as Liverpool proved. Therefore I hereby proclaim the Liverpool process!

 Mr President, I am much obliged to the Commissioner for her being present, and would like to start with warm congratulations to Mr Janowski on the report he has presented, which shows that there are some highly creative ways of addressing this old battle of principles, which centres on whether we need more EU funding for regional structure and agricultural subsidies, or whether we have to do more along the lines of innovation, research and technology. I do believe that it is this dispute that has often enough crippled our budget and our Union, and, by your own-initiative report, Mr Janowski, you, with our assistance, are showing the new tendency that we are talking about, the need to, so to speak, ‘Lisbonise’ the Budget, to change the content of the barrel while leaving it labelled ‘Regional Aid’. This has been accomplished very much under pressure from this House, but also – and here I am addressing Commissioner Hübner – from the Commission. That is why this programme includes such features as ‘Jaspers’, ‘Jeremy’, and ‘Jessica’ – things that are new and important when it comes to supporting innovation, which itself is about applying knowledge in the shape of products. We will, in future, be availing ourselves more and more of the resources that we have – the European Investment Bank, the European Investment Fund – in order to get risk capital to the people, and of that I am all in favour. We also take a very positive view of the demand for innovation clusters, of which there are groundbreaking and very good examples. Innovation is not something that happens centrally; it happens in the regions, where the example with which I am very familiar is the Saxon city of Dresden, which has been enabled, through aid from the EU and the regions, to attract large amounts of direct foreign investment, thus resulting in the creation of an innovation cluster. Mention of that leads me to add that I take a very positive view of the reference in this report to the EIT, the European Institute for Technology. I am glad to see that the Commissioner is so much in favour of Poland’s offer of EUR 1 billion to host the EIT; that is the way for us to go in future, and warm congratulations to everyone concerned.

 Mr President, Commissioner, Mr President-in-Office of the Council, ladies and gentlemen, the regulation we are discussing today is indeed urgent and of particular importance, dealing as it does with advanced therapies, across-the-board quality standards, the more rapid availability of high-quality products, and, ultimately, the competitiveness of European businesses. I therefore want to congratulate those Members who had a hand in putting together the compromises; that was the right thing to do, and it was done at the right time. I, too, find this or that part of it indigestible, particularly those that have to do with small and medium-sized enterprises, which the compromise package rather tends to disregard, but this is one of those times when we all have to make a superhuman effort for the sake of coherence, in order that we might achieve uniformity of regulation, and, not least with the Seventh Research Framework Programme in mind. To be sure, this does have to do with ethics, but it is also about the way in which different ethical standards collide and the challenge that that presents us with. At the end of the day, though, it is about people, and they should come first. What we are fighting about is the prevention of suffering, and that is why I should like to congratulate the Presidency of the Council, for I know, Mr Schroeder, that you too have done the seemingly impossible, and that is why I find so much of the hysteria, indulged in by the Greens in particular, quite incomprehensible.

 Mr President, first of all, I should like to join in congratulating the rapporteur warmly on this very good report, which has broad majority support in the committee. I should also like to congratulate the President of the European Investment Bank, who is here today. He represents the largest investment bank in the world. The EIB has a very good reputation, and the EU can be proud of the important role it plays on the world stage by virtue of this Bank. This is partly thanks to President Maystadt himself and his communicative role, whose influence is felt in the political sphere. My role as rapporteur for the Competitiveness and Innovation Programme (CIP) – the key programme for innovation in Europe – has shown me how crucial the role of the EIB is for innovation. In the shape of JASPERS and JEREMIE, the Bank has launched further instruments to help it really build on innovation. We saw how the EIB also played a key role in reaching a compromise on the budget by virtue of the ‘Risk Sharing Finance Facility’ – I have to use these English terms, unfortunately – so warm thanks for this as well. We could not have adopted our budget without the Bank’s contribution. I should like to add, however – and this also goes for my fellow Members from Mediterranean countries – that we should pay more attention to innovation in the field of cohesion, too. Merely supporting cohesion will not help in the context of a Lisbon Strategy based on innovation. We must ensure that the focus of all projects is on innovation. The EIB should also explore new paths. I should like to raise the issue of patents in this regard. Europe has very few patents compared with the USA, and, in particular, very expensive patents compared with China. In this context, the European Investment Bank could play a key role in funding patents for small and medium-sized enterprises. A conference was held on this subject recently, at which the EIB was represented via the European Investment Fund. The EIB and the EIF voiced their strong support for this, as did Parliament, but the Commission was a little hesitant. We must go down this route, however, if we are to raise awareness of innovation among SMEs. I should like to turn to the major issue of energy. I am delighted that the EIB has already assumed a prominent role in an issue that will be huge in coming years. The Bank supports a multitude of projects, particularly in the field of pipelines, and will continue to be crucial here in future, as our energy strategy can only be realised if the Bank retains an active, leading role in this field. I should like to mention the issue of projects outside the EU. The rapporteur calls for an increase in the funds for Latin America. This alone will not do. We must make it possible for the EIB to provide financing anywhere in the world where European strategic projects are being carried out – such as Beijing airport. This is of paramount importance to us Europeans. The EIB should be the anchor point of the European support landscape, and it is Mr Maystadt’s job to ensure that this is the case. The relationship between the EIB and the European Bank for Reconstruction and Development (Council of Europe bank) must also be clarified.

 Mr President, Commissioner, we all know that energy is the European Union’s lifeline. Unfortunately, we only think about it occasionally, on Sundays. I believe the EU as a whole is being very naive in the way it is dealing with the subject of energy. Energy policy still consists of half-measures and the Member States are following different strategies. The spring summit on energy was a failure, that has become clear. The EU-Russia summit, that was important for us and had an energy component, collapsed because of Polish beef. There are ideological disputes over atomic policy, these are things that are holding us up. There are important regions of the world that could be key suppliers for us, such as Central Asia, but we have paid them little attention so far. China, as has been mentioned several times in the debate, is building a large number of strategic alliances in the world in this very matter. On the other hand, we are very highly dependent on oil and gas, we do not have sufficient interconnectors for a genuine European energy market, as we saw not long ago with this year’s blackout. I think that is a very poor record over all. We therefore very much welcome the fact that you are getting more action plans off the ground, Commissioner, that the German Council Presidency will be concentrating on energy and that countries such as Finland, for example, are taking a very non-ideological and nevertheless very successful approach to energy policy by investing very heavily in biomass and also in atomic power at the same time, because they have obviously recognised the signs of the times. I also particularly welcome the fact, Commissioner, that with the biomass action plan you have made what will probably be a very important contribution to energy diversification, to reducing our dependence on other regions of the world and to the ‘lisbonisation’ of our entire EU agenda. I am thinking in particular of the agricultural plan here. The plans are on the table. Now it is up to the Member States to stick to those plans.

 Mr President, I would like to thank the Commissioner for this debate and to thank Mrs Parvanova, without whose question this debate would not have been possible. Commissioner, you have instituted a public consultation process on the issues surrounding patient mobility. That is the perfect way to clear up questions such as: what gaps in the legislation are there in an internal market for health services that is, in fact, not a real internal market at all? What shape could common standards on patient rights in Europe take? What access do patients have to information, and not just information in relation to their rights, but also in relation to their medication? At present, information of this nature is restricted in Europe, as we all know, and represents a fundamental obstacle to good health. What arrangements would health tourism bring about when correctly implemented, and what aid opportunities and productivity would it bring the European Union? We should think of Europe as a single health area. That should be our vision. Perhaps the public consultation process could be the first step in the right direction.

 Mr President, let me start with warm congratulations to the rapporteur, Mr Ransdorf, who really has got stuck in to the subject and tried to cover every aspect of it; I also appreciate his philosophical reflections at the beginning of his speech. We Europeans have to be aware of the fact that we will not remain leaders in a range of markets and technologies for ever, and that there are many markets in which we have already lost it, and along with it the power to control many technologies; one thinks of the pharmaceutical industry, more and more of which is moving away from Europe, and microelectronics, a sphere in which more and more of the discoveries are being made in Asia. Although, in nanotechnology, we Europeans are ahead of the world and are, technologically speaking, the tops, this has to be qualified by saying that we focus not only on the technology, but also on people, and that is a characteristically European approach, one that is brought out in this report – at any rate in the form in which it was adopted by the Committee on Industry, Research and Energy. That is the form in which it must remain. The report in its present form strikes a balance between high-tech and the bounds of ethics as well as between industrial policy and the interests of the consumer, both of which are equally important and must be balanced. If we are to stay ahead, real support must be forthcoming from the European Union, and that can be done not only through the Seventh Framework Programme for Research but also – and this is at least equally important – through standardisation and the application of norms. What is needed for global competition is a globally binding framework, and this is where we can do as we did with GSM technology, where we Europeans were active in moving the process forward and achieved a certain position on the world market. The big problem with the whole nano-debate, though, is that the subject is too abstract; people have no conception of what it is about, and so, once more, the door is wide open to those who make it their business to spread fear throughout Europe, whose attitudes are reflected in a number of amendments tabled here, just as they were when we were considering software patents, and also, to some degree, with REACH. We cannot afford the same thing with nanotechnology, to which the scaremongers in the fear industry are becoming the principal obstacles. What we need at the moment, though, is every job we can get; it is because we must not blow out of the water the Lisbon Strategy that is on our lips every day that we have to make nanotech more real to people. Nanotechnology is already creating jobs; I myself have visited firms working in this field and find it utterly fascinating. There is enormous scope available in the semiconductor industry, in the automobile sector and in medical technology. By all means, let us have risk assessments, but let us not go overboard about them. Can anyone among you confirm to me that they do not use a mobile phone in view of the known risks involved? If consumers see the potential gain as greater than the potential damage, then they will use the technology; that is what is absolutely crucial, and that is why people need to be able to have the information on the basis of which they can come to their own decisions. We in the European Parliament are playing our part in ensuring that they get it. STOA, this House’s Committee for scientific technology options assessment, is organising nano-cafés, which are happening in Brussels on 18 October, and you are all warmly invited.

Mr President, Commissioner Verheugen, you have spoken on the theme of innovation. At a time like this, when the Football World Cup is on, the image that comes to mind in connection with this topic is that of the Japanese: they played wonderfully up to the penalty area, but then they did not score a goal. Then there was the match between Brazil and Ghana, where the Ghanaians gave perhaps the best showing of any African team, but did not score any goals. It is much the same with we Europeans when it comes to innovation: we are brilliant at inventing things, and we are brilliant when it comes to reaching the penalty area, but we cannot convert this into goals. I am therefore grateful to you, Commissioner, and to the rapporteur as well, for this report and for your statements. I would also like to give my compliments to the rapporteur, who had to deal with shifting majorities in the committee, which led to there being light and dark aspects to this report. I will start with the darker aspects. Let us take for example the problem posed by patent law. The law clearly demands that the Member States end the dispute about languages so that we can have a European patent. This formulation is too weak: since then it has become a question of much more than languages. What is needed is to find a skilful, interesting and intelligent combination between the London Agreement and the patent litigation system, in other words a litigation system where we very clearly have to create a court that would be responsible for dealing with patent law. Another important point is the reporting responsibilities that we demand for SMEs. We are asking the Commission to define a responsibility to report on how innovation potential is being measured. In doing so, however, we are quite clearly creating more bureaucracy. If we ask the Commission to demand these reports then it will do so from small and medium-sized enterprises, and they will thus be additionally burdened with bureaucracy. That is the wrong way to go about things. The correct way to proceed, however, would be to adopt those points that will find a broad majority in this House: for example, if we were to promote business enterprises in Europe in such a way that failure in business were to become a genuine possibility, one that we could recognise and accept - as we can see in Anglo-Saxon countries. We should introduce measures to prevent the best researchers and innovators from leaving Europe, and we must create infrastructures so that European researchers can once again be at home in Europe, since there are indeed many researchers in the world who would gladly move back to Europe. We could also arrange additional subsidies for especially creative small and medium-sized enterprises. Together with the Commission, this House has adopted the Competitiveness and Innovation Framework Programme, the CIP  and I am grateful to everybody that this succeeded in first reading  in which we make pre-seed money, that is, risk capital available for these particular initial stages. Of course, there are standards too. I am glad that we have turned to the issue of standards, since through standards and better standardisation mechanisms we could reproduce the success story that we saw in the case of GSM – Commissioner Bangemann was the one who initiated this. Lisbon is not dead, but I would prefer Liverpool, since the Liverpool Process would mean that we could be three-nil behind at half-time in the Champions League Final and yet still win. That is precisely where we now stand.

 Mr President, I am much obliged to the Commissioner for his presentation, but I am particularly obliged, of course, to our rapporteur, Mr Buzek, with whom not only the shadow rapporteurs, but also the rapporteurs for the innovation framework programme enjoyed very close cooperation of an excellent standard. This cooperation will also be important if it becomes apparent not only that Europe is still an inventive continent – a great many things in the world have originated here – but also that FP7 represents the correct response to global changes. Let us make one thing clear: power and powerlessness in the face of globalisation have less and less to do with military aspects and arms, and more and more to do with knowledge, with dominance in and the ability to control certain production processes. That is what we have to address, and for that FP7 is a very important building block. Yet it can bring Europe forward only if we manage to turn invention into innovation – and of course Mr Buzek has cooperated very closely with us in this regard, on ensuring that our research and innovation framework programmes overlap, and on ensuring that more products, more services and more licences originate in Europe. I am obliged to him for this. I should also like to address a direct question to the Commissioner, however, on behalf of myself and my colleague Mr Manders. As we know, there is a Eurobarometer survey that examines the ethical issue that Mr Goebbels has just mentioned, and ascertains the views of Europeans on embryonic stem cell research. We know that the survey has been completed, but we do not know the results, as it appears that the survey has not yet been published. Can you tell us why it has not been published, and what it reveals? Since we are to vote on this sensitive issue this week, it would be very good – a helpful pointer – for us MEPs if we knew the thoughts of the citizens of this continent.

Madam President, Commissioner Verheugen, this is indeed a historic moment, since it would appear that this is the European Union’s first Framework Programme to be adopted at first reading. I should like to express my sincere thanks to the Commission for the excellent proposal without which, after all, this would not have been possible. I am, however, also grateful for the open nature of the negotiations, which involved four directorates-general. Special thanks go to the Austrian Presidency of the Council, which has truly embraced the cause of innovation and the aim of its adoption within the term of its incumbency. I should like to make particular mention of Josef Mandl and Matthias Martinek, who managed to dispel the reservations of several Member States. But my thanks, of course, also go to my fellow Members here in Parliament. I appreciated the trust and cooperation of Mr Vakalis, Mrs Thompson and Mr Turmes as well as the draftsmen of the opinions, especially Mr Langen. I should like to express my particular thanks to my fellow Members from the Committee on Budgets. Without their real commitment to obtaining the additional four billion, to upholding the blockade against the Council Decision, this programme could not have come into being in its current form, since a large part of the additional budget we in Parliament obtained has gone into innovation, into this CIP. My heartfelt thanks, especially to Mr Böge. So what has changed? Where has the European Parliament been able to leave its mark? Our very first priority was to place this programme at the service of small and medium-sized enterprises. These are the main parties involved; they must be the ones to drive innovation in Europe, and we placed them in the foreground by removing many sometimes obviously bureaucratic obstructions, for instance through a new Vademecum. The Commission will publish a CIP handbook to enable applicants quickly and easily to gain information about the CIP and find the right way to obtain support. And then we introduced a new principle. For this, I am extremely grateful to all concerned. This is the principle of ‘no wrong entry’. There is no wrong door within the Commission for an SME. Anyone with a question will not be turned away but will be directed to the right place. This is a new principle and an important contribution to the simplification of procedure, an important step in cutting red tape, and I am confident that the Commission will ensure that detailed inquiries will always find the relevant, competent consultant. This programme has also allowed us to make a quantum leap for innovation, in that we have attempted to close the gap in the so-called ‘precede phase’, the period before a product or idea comes onto the market, by affiliating the programme with the seventh Framework Programme for Research. In our committees we are currently engaged in negotiations on the seventh Framework Programme for Research, and I have been in close collaboration with Mr Buzek, the rapporteur, who is also here today and will say a few words shortly, despite not actually being on the CIP speaking list. I am very glad that our cooperation went so well and that we were able to link the programmes so effectively. It must be said that this programme covers all the essential elements of the Lisbon Agenda, which I should prefer to call the Liverpool Agenda, because Liverpool FC were three-nil down at half-time in the Champions League final and still pulled through to win in the end. This is, after all, the very situation in which we now find ourselves. Nonetheless, the major issues, innovation, competitiveness and energy, are all covered by this programme. When we speak about innovation, we must be sure to define the word properly. Innovation is a name given to anything nowadays. All sorts of things are labelled ‘innovation’. But what is innovation? Innovation is not invention. Invention has to do with research; invention is the process of putting money into knowledge, of investing in knowledge. But innovation is the opposite process – making money out of knowledge! And it is precisely here that we Europeans have a major deficit; it is here that we need to make up for lost time. We have wonderful ideas. We just manage less and less often to convert these ideas into real products. The magnetic-levitation train that you all know, the Transrapid, was invented as early as 1934, and we still have not managed to realise it in Europe. The computer, invented by Konrad Zuse, is hardly produced in the European Union any more. Nuclear fission – perhaps not everyone’s favourite subject – came from the European Union. The Internet was basically invented in the European Union. It blossomed, or its use blossomed, elsewhere. Or that hot topic, MP3, a German invention, although 90% of sales are now made outwith the EU. This Competitiveness and Innovation Framework Programme creates scope not only for inventions but for their concrete application in Europe as well. This is the only way we can achieve the Lisbon objectives; it is the only way we can make progress. My sincere thanks once again to all concerned.

 Mr President, Commissioner, I would like, first of all, to congratulate Mr Papastamkos on this truly outstanding report. I know that he has put a great deal of himself into it and has been personally involved in the work on it, so I warmly congratulate him on this document. There are two points to which I would like to draw attention. The first is that of geographical indications of origin. It is to be regretted that neither the Commission nor we Europeans as a whole have succeeded in resolving the issue of geographical designations of origin, important though it is, and we are talking here not only about places and names, but also about the knowledge contained in the products that come from these places. In very many cases, Europe is the original that many others imitate, and we should make them pay us for that.  The second point I would like to discuss is the one that Mrs Mann, Mr Karim and others raised, which has, fortunately, had some influence on the report. It is not acceptable that 130 parliamentarians from 80 countries should spend three days negotiating and then not be mentioned even once in the final communiqué
, whilst there are six references to non-governmental organisations in the same document. That is an invitation to put a question mark against this assembly's democratic legitimacy. To whom, if not to democrats, should it refer? Quite apart from that, I wish Mr Papastamkos every success in carrying this idea forward.

 Mr President, Mr President-in-Office of the Council, Commissioner, this is a quite crucial week in terms of the credibility of the European Union and of this House in particular. Demands are being made of European policymakers and of this House, and we have to face up to our responsibilities and discharge them. We constantly affirm our desire to reduce mass unemployment, so we are credible only if we do something for those people who have no work, and we can do it now. This week sees us voting on the services directive, which, if implemented, will be capable of creating 600 000 new jobs in Europe, provided that it is adopted in the same form as it has been by my own Industrial Committee or in that approved by the Committee on the Internal Market. The compromise had taken on board the justified criticisms levelled at the Commission’s original draft, while also ensuring that new dynamism would be injected into the EU’s services market. My opinion was accepted by the Industry Committee with only six of its members voting against doing so, but the attempt at a compromise that we now have before us, the result of haggling between the two major groups, testifies to their contempt for the specialised committees and the laborious work done by them. The common denominator is, in the final analysis, so small that it does not justify the efforts of the past years. This compromise is not only an assault on the principle of the internal market, to which we owe our prosperity and integration, but also a slap in the face for the new Member States, who have been virtually excluded from the negotiations on it. The vote on the services directive gives us at the European level the opportunity to make our contribution to the Lisbon Strategy, for we do indeed know that the Member States are making heavy weather of at last doing what they said they would, and it would be a sign of this House’s bankruptcy if we failed to send out a clear message about the need for more new jobs. The trade unions, who continue to spread untruths and panic, are left cold by these arguments. Today, we can expect to see 30 000 well-organised trade unionists trying to prevent the creation of 600 000 new jobs. Some are here to try and hang on to what they already have. We now have the chance to clearly affirm our desire that Europe should be a better place in which to do business. Let us make good use of it.

 Mr President, Mr President-in-Office of the Council, Commissioner Verheugen, SMEs are now being given priority in all speeches – we have heard that from the Council Presidency today. That is a good thing, and I should also like to state quite clearly here that this is also thanks to Commissioner Verheugen, who has given this subject long-overdue momentum. We are obliged to him for this. However, except in many speeches, this subject is not always dealt with appropriately. We can see this in our own institution, as Parliament is starting its discussion at an hour not befitting the issue. We should pull our own socks up too, therefore, and improve the way we deal with this subject. Looking at the figures – which have been cited here – we can see that SMEs are our main point of contact for the Lisbon agenda. Employing two-thirds of the workforce, they are the most important employers, but they are also innovators in many fields, being global leaders in niche and part-markets and also accounting for more than 50% of patents. That means that, in these fields, Europe has the authority and the competence to provide direction that it so badly needs in global competition. The financial resources that we allocate to SMEs contrast sharply with this. In this regard it is plain to see that, in the Commission’s original budget allocation, which was a generous estimate, only 0.3% of all resources had fallen to SMEs. Some of my fellow Members have raised the subject of the framework programme for competitiveness and innovation (CIP). As the rapporteur, I wish to raise an objection, as there have been cuts in this field. We all agree that we need to increase these resources to the maximum. Nevertheless, on the positive side, I should like to say that the Commissioner has appointed a representative for SMEs and, in Françoise Le Bail, has made a very good choice. I should like to congratulate him on this and offer my sincere thanks to the rapporteur on her sound report.

 Mr President, I would like to extend warm thanks to the Commissioner for what he has said, and also to start with a critical observation on our negotiating position as Europeans, for I do believe that we were too honest, in that our position fundamentally repudiated deviousness as part of the negotiating mandate. I think we need to reconsider this, since all the others used subterfuges. We did not, instead preferring to put our outcomes on the table very early on. On the credit side, I would like to point out that your negotiating style and the way in which you communicated information to this House helped reinforce our determination, and for that you have our warm thanks. That has of course enabled us to influence the budget deliberations in Brussels, and that I regarded as a very good thing. Where geographical designations of origin were concerned, we got nowhere. That is something you mentioned, and many speakers have also made it clear how important an issue this is for us. I have to tell the Commissioner that our geographical designations of origin and the intellectual property that is tied in with them are things for which we have to fight. In doing that, we will have to be cunning and maintain a united front.

 Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, Europe seems remote from the man in the street, but China scares people. Just as globalisation is frightening people at the moment – at any rate that is the outcome not only of the referendums in France and the Netherlands, but also of the elections in Germany, which have shown that people are somewhat afraid of reform. The particular subject of China, however, and of trade relations with China in particular, can give the European Union greater meaning and purpose. We are an export-oriented economic unit, and we Europeans need the Chinese market. For that, we need as much free trade as possible, yet it is the European Union alone that will ultimately help us against unfettered globalisation and the possible loss of our own cultural identity. That is easy to demonstrate. We do need safeguards, though. Particularly where intellectual property is concerned, we Europeans are not strategic enough; we do not act decisively enough. If that does not change soon, we will be sawing off the branch on which we are sitting, and that will become clear very soon, especially in the Europeans’ relationship with the Chinese. We must be even more forceful, more outspoken and more strategic in protecting intellectual property against the Chinese, and we must do that as quickly as possible.

 Mr President, Commissioner, let me start by expressing my – our – congratulations on your success in achieving this interim result in the negotiations with the United States. This is an important trade project, accounting for EUR 2.3 billion, but the trading relationship involves two different systems, with different approaches to production and marketing, and so cooperation is not easy. It is for that reason that this agreement can be regarded as no more than a first step, a first phase agreement, and I am glad that you have described it in those terms. In the past, we accepted many derogations for the Americans; the trading relationship made that necessary. What matters now, though, is that our rules on labelling should be enforced, and we also see it as significant that the USA is ready and willing to resolve all bilateral issues through consultation rather than through the WTO’s dispute settlement procedures, but what is surely most important to us Europeans is that geographical indications of origin should enjoy in the United States the protection that they deserve, in return for which we – for the time being – are prepared to accept the Americans’ winemaking practices. That may be a bitter pill, but we have to swallow it; its effect will be only temporary and the labelling rules – which will result in greater freedom for what we hope are emancipated consumers – will help it go down. Nevertheless, in the second stage of negotiations, the Commission must go further and press for the improved protection of intellectual property in winemaking, an area in which we Europeans have led the world in establishing worldwide standards, and so we should not relax our efforts on this point; we also suggest that the Commission should push for a WTO-wide register of geographical descriptions of origin, something that both the speakers before me mentioned. To sum up, this agreement may not be brilliant, but it is a first, and an important step, and you, Commissioner, have done the right thing. The next step must now be taken hand in hand with the reform of the market organisation for wine, to which we all look forward eagerly. We can take pride in our European wine. It is esteemed and enjoyed the world over. We enjoy a global advantage in wine production, and we need to maintain it by further improving the protection of intellectual property. We wish you, Commissioner, much success in doing this.

 Madam President, Commissioner, there is no doubting the fact that this Galileo project is of the utmost strategic importance and, as a public-private partnership of such great dimensions, unique in the EU. I wish to thank the rapporteur for her efforts, not only on my own part but also on behalf of my group. There is one point on which I would like to give her very strong backing, and that is her demand that the European Parliament, as the budgetary institution, should have a seat on 

the Administrative Board. Our institution’s budgetary role does indeed mean that we should be fully informed about the financial aspects of the Galileo project. There are very practical considerations behind this, for third countries have acquired smaller holdings – China in particular, which bought a share in our project on 30 October 2003. Having wanted to invest a total of 20 million in what is a 3.5 billion project, it gave notice of the intention to buy 5 million but paid only 2 million. This amount – 0.06%, a thousandth, of the total – puts China in full possession of the know-how that Galileo has to offer and gives it unrestricted access to it. I have conducted my own inquiries in Oberpfaffenhofen and seen how our know-how and intellectual property are not secure. I ask you, Commissioner, to do everything in your power to prevent our technology from being sold off to others. While we want third countries to be involved and markets to be conquered, we must also see to it that our intellectual property is protected. Let me particularly draw your attention to an amendment – No 22 – tabled by my colleague Mrs Hall, which is aimed at ensuring that, at a later date, when commercial operations begin, the European Union gets its contribution repaid, in other words, that there is a real distribution of profits. This debate is a significant one, and deserves to have more people observing it and listening to it. That is something we cannot change. I wish the rapporteur, Mrs Barsi-Pataky, every success in getting her report through.

 Mr President, the report that we are debating underlines the importance and strength of this House. If we compare the draft directive as presented by the Commission with the compromise that we hope to adopt tomorrow, what becomes apparent is what this House is capable of achieving in the field of energy policy. That this House has been able to exert considerable influence is attributable in no small degree to the unambiguous stance taken by the rapporteur. The Commission’s original proposal tended to exemplify a planned economy in which the administration would have determined in which parts of their infrastructure businesses would be allowed to invest. Parliament has succeeded in bringing out of this dirigiste 
document an approach guided by competitiveness, which will do a far better job of addressing the problems of security of supply, something made all the more important by the fact that Europe’s current development is characterised by an increasing demand for electricity, which has caused renewed attention to be given to the need for new power stations. The right conclusion to draw from the power cuts in Italy in 2003 would have been that the blame for these lay primarily with the lack of competition in the clapped-out infrastructure. Particularly where public services are concerned, privatisation and competition are invariably two sides of the same coin. The Commission took a step in the wrong direction by assuming, as it originally did, that state bodies could make good the lack of competition and would, in cases of doubt, be more competent to judge which parts of the Member States’ network infrastructure were in need of investment. What, now improved, is left in the proposal for a directive itself shows how increased competition can be a winning strategy. By promoting the conditions under which a wholesale market can function adequately and send appropriate price signals for investment in production capacity, the EU is taking the right approach to dealing with the issue of security of supply. Its most important objective must be the creation of viable energy market structures in which businesses can make money, that being the right incentive for the creation of an investment climate in which infrastructure can come into being. This directive is not one of those that are toxic to enterprise, and a good thing too. We therefore agree with the rapporteur’s proposal and congratulate him too.

 Mr President, Prime Minister, a fortnight ago, Mr Blair, we had the opportunity to visit you in London and to find out something about how you saw the Presidency. You made it clear to us on that occasion that it is objective facts that interest you, that your concern is with the matter in hand rather than with how to exploit a situation. It may well be the case that the EU was once supported by the pillars of coal, steel and agriculture, but it is not that vision that drives people onward. That is not the Europe that we imagine today. You are right to put the emphasis on research, innovation and Europeans’ competitiveness. The time for the old narrative, the former vision, is past, and now we need a new one. Jacques Chirac and Chancellor Schröder have described themselves as ashamed of the way you behaved. My dear Mr Blair, I have to tell you that I am ashamed of the way my Chancellor behaved at this summit, not to mention ashamed of the behaviour of Jacques Chirac, for neither of them can see that we need a new vision, and what this in fact means is that we are obliged to go down your road. You chose the right moment, and so I would like to congratulate you and bid you carry on as you have begun.

 Madam President, I should like to start by congratulating the rapporteur, who, by focussing on the right issues, has secured an increase in funding. It must not be assumed, however, that more money automatically means a better programme. I was present at the special meeting held in Strasbourg when the Commissioner spoke for the first time about his personal experience of this multiannual programme for SMEs, and I paid very close attention to what he had to say on the matter. In a nutshell, he said that he had been shocked to learn of the cumbersome application process, particularly in view of the fact that the programme was intended to boost innovation. He had also been shocked to discover that the main recipients of funding were not the small and medium–
sized enterprises that needed it most, but resourceful enterprises that knew the ins and outs of the programmes and were therefore granted money. In his opinion, it is for this reason that the programmes ought to be made more rigorous. I should like to congratulate the Commissioner, as his analysis is entirely correct. I am glad to see that there appears to have been a shift in thinking on this matter, and he deserves thanks for having made SMEs the focus of initiatives for growth and increased competitiveness. We will be right behind him if he goes on to demand of his officials that programmes should exist not merely for bureaucratic reasons or because they have impressive names, but only if they concentrate on SMEs, or in other words on those enterprises that are in need of help. We have had enough of programmes that are nothing more than fancy names; what we need now are clear and innovative strategies for SMEs and new forms of financing. In future, these programmes will be combined in the Competitiveness and Innovation Programme. This is both a consistent approach and a step in the right direction, and I particularly welcome the fact that parallels will exist between this Programme and the Seventh Research Framework Programme. We must not repeat past mistakes, however, even if everything is now to be combined in a new document. What matters is that growth and jobs are the ultimate goals, rather than the ideological gratification of political groups. Yet we are running the risk of this being precisely what happens in the case of the CIP; one need only look at the heavy emphasis on eco–
innovations and energy efficiency for proof of this. More questions need to be asked in this respect, and I will be able to ask some of these in my capacity as rapporteur. We are about to adopt a new Financial Perspective, at a time when the citizens of all the EU Member States are being increasingly careful with their money. They will regard it as unforgivable if we, their legislator, miss the opportunity now available to us to opt for the provision of real support to SMEs and for priority to be given to creating more jobs, and if we instead indulge in ideological disputes.

Mr President, we Europeans have every right to expect China to meet all the obligations that membership of the WTO implies, but China should also be guided by the spirit of the WTO rules, in the same way that Commissioner Mandelson himself is guided by the spirit of the Constitution, even though the Constitution is not yet in force. It is for that reason that we welcome the imposition of safeguards. Compliance with the treaties must be tested and demonstrated. So far, of course, China’s accession to the WTO has been a triumph not only for China itself, but also – and particularly – for us Europeans. We should at long last come to see the debate in its global dimension, and not just from the narrow Eurocentric angle. Commissioner Mandelson has tried to look at it globally. Calls are made for the return of trade barriers and for tighter controls, but these would be a slap in the face for the European manufacturers who have spent 10 years campaigning for a changeover from quota-based trade to more competition, and have now been successful. To return to the special arrangements would be to regress to protectionism, and that, now in particular, would send completely the wrong message. Nevertheless, minimum standards in the labour market have not ceased to matter; they still do, and it is for that reason that we Europeans should do everything in our power to get the WTO, too, to accept more democratic rules.

Mr 
President, in Europe is all our hope, but its prospects are not good, to judge by what is said in the debates in those Member States preparing to hold a referendum. What is the cause of this? It is not just about the work we do; rather, the cause is to be found in broad public opinion, and particularly the way in which it is reported in the media, for it is primarily they, rather than us alone, that influence the climate within which public opinion is formed, and so that is where we must start. Much as I am in favour of the efforts to standardise school textbooks and of the adaptation of information to the groups for which it is intended, what matters is that our public relations work – that done here in the European Parliament and also by the other European institutions – should become more professional. It is still the case, for example, that nothing dramatic happens in this House that might be of interest to journalists and would make the proceedings clearer. Our votes are held quite separately from our debates. What this means is that we have to get the fourth pillar of democracy, the fourth of the four powers, the media, more involved. That is what we must aim for.

 Mr President, I should like to thank the rapporteur for her excellent report; it is now up to you, Commissioner Potočnik, and your fellow Commissioners to ensure that the research priorities are implemented. I should like to focus on just one of these priorities, which in all probability will be absent from tomorrow’s report, namely defence research. After consulting the rest of my group, I have withdrawn an amendment on this matter in view of the confusion it could have caused, inter alia
 in connection with the Council. Why have I decided to speak out in favour of defence research? Our future Constitution provides for the development of the common foreign and security policy, which means that we will need to carry out research in this field, some of which will be secret. We must therefore be capable of copying the Americans by adopting a ‘black box’ approach to individual projects. Yet we should step up transatlantic research cooperation in other fields where research lies in the interests of humanity as a whole. This will give rise to a research dialogue between equals that would be appropriate in the case of a number of other countries, as well as the USA.

 Mr President, Commissioner, Mr Schmit, the President of Ukraine has summed it up very aptly today. The principle that his country associates with Europe is democracy – and the democrats in the Republic of Moldova are looking to us as well. What they want from us is not only a commitment to them as Europeans, but also a clear signal over and above the neighbourhood strategy. That is why I believe that – especially in the light of events in its neighbour, Ukraine – we must offer Moldova a clearer perspective. With the Thessaloniki strategy, the EU mapped out a course for the countries of the Western Balkans. What about the countries that are only now shrugging off the shackles of the past? Ukraine has set a precedent. It is to be hoped that the Republic of Moldova will follow suit on 6 March, and even Belarus will in future have no option but to embark on the path towards democracy. What we need now is a Thessaloniki strategy for these three countries. It is an anachronism that the Republic of Moldova is the only country in the Stability Pact for South Eastern Europe to have no prospect of accession to the European Union. It would be splendid if, very soon, this House could welcome a democratically elected President from the Republic of Moldova who is genuinely committed to democratic politics. At the moment, that is not the case, as I saw for myself during my visit to Chisinau ten days ago. If, though, there is to be a European Republic of Moldova, the election on 6 March must be democratic. We appeal to our European friends in the Republic of Moldova to go and vote, to vote for democracy, and to make the Republic of Moldova freer, more democratic and more European so that this House can very soon bid their country welcome.

 Mr President, in the area of trade policy, this Constitution puts the European Parliament in a much stronger position. When, as was formerly the case, the European Parliament’s democratic control did not extend to trade policy, that gave rise to constant criticism. This House did not even have to be consulted when the autonomous trade legislation was adopted. In future, necessary measures will have to be laid down by European acts and framework legislation, so, in principle, Parliament will participate as an equal. That is something in which we should take great satisfaction. It is still, however, a source of anguish that it has still not yet been possible to make qualified majority voting the norm in the Council. On this, the Convention was more advanced than the Intergovernmental Conference. Nevertheless, this Constitution makes for greater consistency in the trade policy matters that we have been dealing with within the WTO ever since the Uruguay round. This Constitution puts the European Union on a better legal footing for conducting negotiations.

 Mr President, the matter at hand is written statement 0001/2009, which obtained the required majority. I would like to thank all my fellow Members on behalf of all the authors of the written statement. This has nothing to do with the votes.

) Around 80% of EU funds are still being managed and spent by the Member States and there are still open questions and irregularities in connection with the handling of European Union money. The European Court of Auditors has now failed to confirm the legality and regularity of the EU’s financial transactions in its annual audit reports 14 times in succession. Complete disclosure and inspection of EU expenditure is essential. It is necessary for the Member States’ finance ministers to submit a national statement of assurance for all of the EU funds used.

 The legal basis used, Article 13(1) of the EC Treaty, is not appropriate considering that, in the opinion of the German Free Democratic Party (FDP), the principle of subsidiarity is not being adhered to. It is not within the remit of the EU legislator to lay down the regulations in question, thereby seriously encroaching on the self-determination of the Member States. Combating discrimination of all kinds and helping the disabled to participate in public life are important tasks. However, proposing to extend the anti-discrimination regulations to practically all areas of life is out of touch with reality. The reversal of the burden of proof laid down in the directive will mean that it is possible to open legal proceedings on the basis of accusations not backed up by sufficient evidence. Those affected would then have to pay compensation even if they have not actually committed any acts of discrimination but are unable to prove their innocence. Defined in this sweeping way, this reversal of the burden of proof is therefore questionable from the point of view of its compatibility with acting as a state under the rule of law. It will create uncertainty and facilitate abuse. That cannot be the raison d’être
 of a progressive anti-discrimination policy. A further consideration must be that the Commission is currently pursuing infringement proceedings against numerous Member States in relation to inadequate transposal of the existing European directives on anti-discrimination policy. There is as yet, however, no overview of those regulations that have been transposed so as to make it possible to determine the need for new regulations that has been claimed. Germany, in particular, has already gone far beyond previous stipulations from Brussels. We therefore voted against this report.

Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, the European Union has proven to be a stroke of luck in the financial and economic crisis and the Czech Presidency has also done a proper job thus far. The extent and the deeper causes of the global financial and economic crisis prove that global macroeconomic management of the financial markets and the legal frameworks which apply to it need to be revised – at national level, in the EU and worldwide. Supervisory legislation must be amended and precautions for crisis management improved. Legislation governing the financial sector should have the effect of blunting rather than exacerbating economic cycles. However, more regulation does not necessarily mean better regulation; what we need is the right regulation. The dramatic crisis on the international financial markets and the shifts that it has caused are a challenge to the liberal economic order. Erroneous decisions by governments in economic and financial policy and inadequate financial supervision by governments and the manifest collapse of a number of banks are reason to call for a reformed financial system, not a new economic system. The independence of the European Central Bank and its approach to monetary stability are right and have proven their worth. We also have proof of how important the common market is to prosperity and stability in Europe. The internal market is playing a central role in shortening and dampening the recession in Europe. The Member States need to take fast, targeted and temporary measures to support the real economy, because we know that the EU can create prosperity if it continues to develop the internal market, but not if it is distributing subsidies. The European Union must therefore continue to work consistently to complete the internal market and offer a framework for competition that works. However, it is also clear that the test has not yet been passed. The European Union must hold fast to its principles. There must be no relapse into outmoded thinking, into protectionism, into a policy of compartmentalisation or into a race for subsidies. The Czech Presidency stands for this and I hope that we can continue to count on that.

 Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, reform of EU finances is long overdue and I am grateful to Mr Böge, the rapporteur, for establishing this. We need a fair, simple, transparent, reliable and sustainable revenue and spending system for the EU. The finance for the EU budget should come only from two sources, in other words the traditional own resources and the payments based on the economic power of the Member States, that is, a proportion of gross national income. In this case, the Member States should contribute a maximum of 1% of their GNI. Instead of making more money available for the EU, the funds should be redeployed to areas where genuine added value can be obtained on a European level, for example common foreign policy, trans-European networks, management of external borders and research. On the other hand, there should be no more long-term subsidies. This also means that the VAT-based own resources should be abolished and, most importantly, that there must be no EU tax, regardless of its form, while the EU is not a truly representative democracy. It is right for there to be a ban on EU public indebtedness. This is an excellent policy and must be retained. In addition, all the EU finance ministers must at last make a national statement of assurance. Thank you very much and I wish you every success in your new role.

 Linguistic diversity is important. It is part of the day-to-day reality in the European Union and is gaining increasing significance in the relationships between the Member States, in the way in which our multicultural societies live together and in the common policy measures taken by the European Union. However, the decision-making power on matters of language policy lies primarily with the Member States. It is not the responsibility of the European Parliament to lay down requirements and recommendations for language policy. The fact that the EU has a Commissioner for Multilingualism makes it clear that reform of the Commission is urgently needed and that there must be fewer Commissioners than there are Member States.

 Madam President, President-in-Office of the Council, the European Union has had six months of drama, dynamism and declarations under President Sarkozy, and now you have taken over, Mr President, with a sense of humour that may take some getting used to. I hope that yours will be a constructive, productive Council Presidency, as the EU faces immense challenges. You yourself mentioned the war between Israel and Hamas and the economic crisis, and of course there are also internal issues such as the Treaty of Lisbon. Allow me to take up one aspect of your speech: energy security. You stressed its fundamental importance, and I agree with you that energy is the basic raw material of modern society. Our lifestyle, our economy, our further development – all of this depends upon it. We cannot be dependent on energy supplies. Independence requires that we have a good mix of various energy sources. Therefore, I hope that with your open, direct manner, you will be able to persuade your European partners to engage in a new discussion on nuclear power and, in particular, to encourage the German Government to end its anti-nuclear policy. This is a requirement of security for our continent. There is a great deal to be done, and this is your opportunity to take Europe forward. I should like to express my thanks and my confidence in successful cooperation to come.

 Mr President, Mr Le Maire, Mr Borloo, in recent months the EU has very much proved its worth. That is to your credit, to the credit of the French Presidency. I would have liked to have thanked President Sarkozy personally for taking the uncomfortable step of telling the German Chancellor clearly what he thought of the German Government’s lethargy. Other European countries are taking action to prevent the crisis, but Germany is waiting until the crisis is upon us or until the next Bundestag elections. Germany is the largest economy in the EU and that is why it is a good thing that the EU partners have reminded the German Government of its responsibility. President Sarkozy has just repeated that reminder here. If the EU had not existed, we would have had to invent it at the latest as a result of the financial crisis. None of the EU countries acting alone would have been or are in a position to combat the crisis. The euro is also an important stabilising force. It has once again become clear how important the common market is for prosperity and stability in Europe. However, we must not use the financial crisis as an excuse for putting at risk what we have jointly achieved. Therefore, the independence of the European Central Bank should be non-negotiable. We must not allow a return to protectionism. A renewal of the isolationist policy or a subsidy race between the Member States would also have catastrophic consequences for our citizens. In addition, the EU regulations on competition and state aid must on no account be watered down. This also applies to the Stability Pact with the Maastricht criteria. We must preserve these achievements. However, the EU must take joint, concerted and decisive action to prevent the worst from happening. This is an opportunity for Europe, and President Sarkozy has made use of it. He has shown our citizens what Europe can do and given Europe a human face. I would like to thank him warmly for this.

 Mr President, Madam Vice-President, next year – 2009 – is indeed a very important year for the European Union, for it is the year in which the European elections are due to take place, and more generally, the major question as to the European Union's future course must be answered. The elections will take place: that we do know, but what we do not yet know is the exact basis on which we will be working together thereafter. That is a question to which our citizens are quite rightly expecting an answer. From the European institutions' perspective, how do we envisage the future of Europe? The Commission's legislative and work programme of course offers an opportunity to provide a comprehensive answer to this question. That is why we, as the Parliament, have agreed to set out our own requirements of the Commission's work programme first, before it is presented to us and we then react to it. The European Union faces these major challenges of direct relevance to its future. What will that future bring? At the same time, so much is happening in the world which directly affects citizens in their daily lives, such as rising energy prices and the financial crisis. Here, we need clear words from Europe to explain how the European Union intends to respond. For that, we need conviction and leadership. That is why it is important for the European Commission to set out very clearly how it intends to respond to these crises and, in its work programme, to define exactly where the political priorities must lie. In this context, it is important, from our perspective, for the Commission to keep the European Union's competitiveness in mind. In an increasingly globalised market, it is important for us to define this as one of our continued political priorities. Other aspects which are equally important, however, are strengthening and protecting civil rights, expanding research, and finding a solution to climate change. These are other issues which have been very important topics in the House for many years. These areas should be defined by the Commission, and above all, it should also ensure that Europe is able to take credit for any successes achieved. It is often the case that if something is achieved which is entirely in line with citizens' interests and wellbeing, the Member States take the credit. I would like the Commission to pay more heed to this in future. In that respect, I am very pleased to see you, Madam Vice-President, here today. There are one or two of our fellow Members of the House who have to accept that Mr Barroso, the Commission President, had something else in his diary for today. I am pleased that you are here, Madam Vice-President, because you are responsible for driving forward communication in the European Union and this might present an opportunity for today's topic – namely the Commission's work programme – to be fully debated in the national parliaments as well, so that we have this type of interplay from the outset. In the German Bundestag, this now takes place in most of the committees, but it is something which should undoubtedly form part of the plenary agenda in the national parliaments throughout Europe as a whole. Europe's hour has come: that much should be obvious. We are facing global challenges, and Europe has no option but to develop a joint response.

 Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, the global financial crisis has spread through the markets with unforeseeable consequences. Some people may feel a sense of satisfaction at the sight of bankers falling from grace and losing their jobs. However, this is very short-sighted, for the real losers are not the company bosses or the traders. It is ordinary families who are hardest hit by the credit crunch and the collapse in the value of shares and savings. It is their financial security which is shattered when the value of pensions and savings is put at risk. That is why it is essential to undertake a precise analysis of the financial crisis and its causes to ensure that it does not happen again, and I am pleased that we are doing so today. Martin Schulz used his speech to rail against the markets. In light of Mr Schulz's predictions last November, which he has kindly reminded us of, this might give him the chance to earn some extra income as an oracle. However, it is money which drives the markets, not hot air, and he needs to recognise that fact. The appropriate response to the current crisis is not a move away from free enterprise. It is enterprise which creates jobs and prosperity. Do the financial markets really need more regulation? Ludwig Erhard, the father of the German economic miracle, summed it up neatly. He said that the state should establish the rules for the economy and the financial system, but like a referee, it should not involve itself in the game. What this means, of course, is that it must take action against fouls and violations of the rules. Regulation is appropriate and necessary in order to avoid excesses, but it is not the market economy which is to blame for the crisis; that blame attaches to those who refuse to abide by frameworks and rules. For years, experts have been warning against high-risk loans, unsecured credit and a bubble waiting to burst in the financial and property markets. We need common and transparent rules for Europe as a whole, and for the world. Yes, we need international controls, but with a sense of proportion. It is no good to anyone if we immobilise capital movements with more rules and trigger an economic downturn. Above all, we need to restore confidence in a free and open market. The economic stability of Europe's and the world's citizens depends on whether we show ourselves to be capable of action. However, the international markets will not stop and wait for decisions in Europe, and nor will they wait for Parliament to make its pronouncements. Commissioner, Minister Jouyet, my group is expecting you to take rapid, rational and successful action, and to do so now.

 Mr President, you said ‘France cannot pass judgment on the Irish “no”’.  (DE) 
I agree. The Irish ‘no’ must be respected. The Irish people are fully within their rights to vote as they have done. However, all the other countries in Europe also have the right to proceed along the road to a more democratic, more transparent Europe that is more capable of taking action. The Treaty of Lisbon is a step in this direction. Therefore I welcome the fact that ratification is being continued. However, I also think – and here I do not share your view, I disagree – that it would be good to speak openly about the fact that a multi-speed Europe already exists. Think of the euro, the Schengen Agreement, the Charter of Fundamental Rights and many other areas. The sensitivities and wishes of the Member States of the EU are reflected in their choice of different speeds for things that they undertake together. A multi-speed Europe makes it possible for countries that want to do more together to do so, for it is important that we maintain the voluntary principle in Europe. It is important that the countries who want to do something together do so voluntarily and that all countries have the option of joining in at any time. No country should be forced into a greater degree of solidarity. A multi-speed Europe also makes it easier to continue accession negotiations. I believe it is wrong for Croatia and Turkey to be punished because the majority of Irish people voted no. Mr President-in-Office, you are quite rightly proud that your country is the home of human rights. Human rights are timeless; they are universal. The Olympic Games are a sporting event, not a political event. Therefore, I believe it is wrong for you to want to go to China for the opening ceremony, and I am glad that the President of the European Parliament, Mr Pöttering, will not be going to China. Mr President-in-Office, let me say in closing that you found on your seat a greeting from many of my female fellow Members – a rose and a letter. The letter asks you to play your part in getting more women to the top of the European Union. Women are pinning their hopes on you as a ‘ladies’ man’. Please allow me to add one more request: as a democratically elected representative, I hope that you will support us in ensuring that this European Parliament is able to take an independent decision about where it is based.
 Silvana Koch-Mehrin  (ALDE

 Mr President, President-in-Office of the Council, President of the Commission, ladies and gentlemen, the Irish ‘no’ vote must be respected; the Irish are perfectly entitled to vote as they have done. However, the other countries are also perfectly entitled to continue the drive for a more democratic, more transparent and more effective Union. The Lisbon Treaty is a step in this direction. Therefore, I welcome the fact that ratification will continue. I also think that it would be good if we were also to talk frankly about a multi-speed Europe. This multi-speed Europe already exists, and it reflects both national sensitivities and the wishes of the EU Member States to allow for different stages of integration. It enables those Member States which would like to do more things together to do so without, on the one hand, being held back by those countries which are more hesitant and, on the other, disregarding the principle of free choice, namely that those countries which want to do something together may do so by their own choice. In a multi-speed Europe, further accessions to the EU are also simplified, as it is wrong to punish Croatia and Turkey for the fact that the majority of Irish people have voted ‘no’. The blame game between the European institutions is getting us nowhere. The problem lies in the fact that the major European projects of recent years – as right and proper as they are – and the enlargement of the EU have been insufficiently anchored in democracy. Now we are having to pay the penalty: always little by little, that is. The good thing about the Irish ‘no’ – trying to see the positive side – is that Europe is being talked about once more. If this opportunity is used to discuss or explore other avenues, I believe that we may then come a little closer to a ‘Europe of citizens’.

 President-in-Office, Mr President, my sincere congratulations on your excellent work, Madam Chancellor. You have achieved a very good result, you have fulfilled expectations. That is no great surprise to the German liberals, because even before the Bundestag elections we were convinced you would make a good leader; I am just saying this for the benefit of Mr Schulz, who said so in effusive terms today, but better late than never. Before the German Presidency began, the Free Democrats in the European Parliament had urged the at the time still very hesitant Federal Government to set an ambitious target regarding the constitutional treaty. We are therefore pleased that at the end of your presidency we not only have a timetable, but that the contents have been agreed as well. However, the price that had to be paid for that is extremely high. Names have been changed, longer time periods set, derogations allowed. With the Charter of Fundamental Rights in particular that is a real disaster. The so-called reform treaty is more complex and less transparent. A minority has had its way at the majority’s expense and the idea of Europe has suffered a severe blow as a result. Whether the decisions that were taken in Brussels in the middle of the night will now actually be implemented remains an open question. There is no guarantee that they will. The Intergovernmental Conference must meet first and then things will not get moving until ratification begins in the 27 countries. Everything is therefore still open. The outcome of the German Presidency is therefore a fairly realistic reflection of the current mood within the EU. It is not abysmal, but it is nothing to celebrate either. What we have is the remote Europe of summits, not the close Europe of citizens. In view of the difficulties that would have made an outcome almost impossible, the Presidency has taken us a good step forwards. More would have been impossible. Mrs Merkel, you have said how you would like Europe’s citizens to remember the year 2007 in 50 years’ time. I would like to add one hope to that: it would please me very much if in 2057 – and I might just live so long – all Europeans were to see the wonderful sentence of the Berlin Declaration ‘we have united for the better’ not as a decision taken in a back room but as something they experience every day. That would be a tremendous success for your Presidency. My sincere thanks once again! (Applause)
 Silvana Koch-Mehrin (ALDE

 Madam President-in-Office of the Council, what I want to do most of all is to congratulate you on two sentences in the Berlin Declaration, the first of which is the one that says that ‘we have united for the better.’ That is a wonderful thing to say, and I see it as running directly counter to those who carp and doubt, who only ever grumble that the EU is something in which their participation is compulsory. What this is all – precisely – about is ‘uniting for the better.’ I also think this beguilingly simple form of words strikes a note to which every citizen can relate. I would also like to congratulate you on having managed to include in the Berlin Declaration a binding commitment to making 2009 the date by when the European Union is to be put on a new footing. That is so definite that none of your fellow Heads of Government can go back on it without suffering a really serious loss of face. Good though it is that this joint declaration should have been made, I have to say that I find its content rather vague, for it has nothing to tell us about what Europe’s future is supposed to be like or – and this is the most important – about how the man and woman in the street are supposed to be involved in it, and so, as we look forward to the second half of your presidency, we look forward to proposals as to how that is to be accomplished. From the depths of our hearts, we wish you much success. If ever you need support in getting the citizens involved, you can certainly rely on us.

 Mr President, Commissioner, when discussing your paper, our group took the view that the Commission has found the right course and is pursuing that course with great confidence, sticking to the areas of policy that it defined at the start of its work, and that it is taking them forward in a way that gives the impression that it is acting with conviction. That comes out in the very first sentence of your work programme, where you say that the policy areas in which the Commission is to be active will meet with broad agreement. We welcome that. We welcome this self-confidence and we also welcome the fact that the Commission has found a clear course. We still want stronger leadership, however. And to stay with the image of a course, we would like you to sail more strongly with the wind, so that you will go faster. That was early praise, so to speak, but in essence we are saying that this is a good programme; in our opinion, however, it is not enough for the situation in which Europe now finds itself. What we are missing above all is a clear word about Europe’s future. In the 24 page working paper you devote all of three lines to Europe’s future, but the question of where we are heading, what our common ‘progress’ should look like, is not answered, and this strategy for a work programme does not even attempt an answer. That we are all working together for Europe is not taken for granted as much as this paper suggests. As Mr Nassauer has already said, it is unfortunately not accepted by the public as much as we would like. That is why it is important that the Commission sets the direction here. We want the Commission to spearhead the movement, demanding clear instructions as to where the European future is actually to go. Your strategy is to supply results. We think that is good. Results are fine for showing the areas in which we are in fact visibly active. Only again and again we have the problem that national politicians, mostly from governments, take the credit for successes, while Europe has to take the blame for failures or unpleasant consequences. The Council’s good results are the most recent example. In Germany, at least, these good results are being credited to Mrs Merkel and the groundwork done by the Commission and European Parliament is not noticed at all. To that extent, the strategy of delivering results is a very ambivalent strategy. Moreover, for all the welcome initiatives you present there are some that make us wonder what the grounds are for your satisfaction. You speak, for example, of a renewed consensus on enlargement. We cannot see that. You also want a common central database for fingerprints. There is no consensus for that either. It surprises us, especially in the light of the fact that, at the start of his term of office, Commission President Barroso styled himself a champion of civil rights. Such a database is the opposite of what he announced at the start of his term of office. My colleagues will speak further about the various areas of policy. I would just like to mention one fundamental structural point that we have always raised in past debates. For the sake of being closer to the citizens and of making this document easier to handle, we would like you to say precisely what are legislative initiatives, what has nothing to do with legislation, what are new initiatives and what are follow-up measures, so that we really know what concrete steps we can expect in the coming year. Of course we would like the citizens to be involved. The Commission is keen on communication. We believe that is right. The more interactive that can be, the better. If, for greater visibility for the policy of results, we can have these debates on strategy not only in the European Parliament, but also in the national parliaments, that would be an important step towards making clear where which policy comes from in the common Europe.

Mr President, Madam President-in-Office of the Council, Mrs Merkel, I should like to extend the warmest of thanks to you for your marvellous words, which were full of feeling. I do not doubt that what you had to say about the values that bind us together – tolerance and freedom among them – mark an important step towards finding the soul of which you spoke. You will of course be aware of what is expected of the German Presidency, and, in particular, of you as President-in-Office, for courage and the strength for leadership are completely absent from this EU of ours, and the expectation of you, Mrs Merkel, is no more and no less than that you will demonstrate that courage and that strength that fits you for leadership, so get down to brass tacks! That is what everyone in this House expects of you. I am glad that you have declared yourself willing to work very hard and constructively with us. You can rely on us. I would like to see the presidency of what is both your country and mine become a success. I am also glad of your forthright statement about the timetable for the constitutional treaty, and think you are right to say that it needs to be ratified by the spring of 2009. You want to get the other Heads of Government committed to this, but, of course, saying this naturally involves saying something else too, namely which constitutional treaty we are actually talking about here. The present one is a busted flush, having been rejected, and so I would like to ask you to say, in quite definite terms, what you think about this. Do you want a shorter version of the kind already proposed, or are you holding fast to the present constitutional treaty? How is it meant to be ratified? Is every country to adopt its own procedure and do it at its own speed? Are there to be national referendums, or is that something you want to steer clear of? Mrs Merkel, you have said on repeated occasions that you want to put the citizen centre stage in European policy, and that is precisely what is needed. That is the response we need to increasing euro-scepticism or rejection of the EU – a citizens’ Europe, rather than a Europe of secret diplomacy. The constitutional treaty is more than just a document laying down processes and voting procedures; it can be the foundation of the shared values that bind us and which are summarised in it. It is for that reason that Europe’s citizens should be given the chance to themselves say what they think about it. What, Mrs Merkel, do you think of the idea of a Europe-wide referendum held on the same day throughout Europe? That would be an historic event. The people could say what they think. What I need to say before I wind up is that more than a million people would like us to conduct this sort of debate in Brussels. That, too, would make me happy. It is up to you.

 Mr President, Commissioners, researchers into time found out this past week that the second half of life passes much more quickly than the first, and that which is true of life is also, of course, true of the lifetimes of legislatures, so, since your Commission has not much time left, it should be all the more ambitious in its approach to doing its work. What that means in terms of the work programme is that it ought to have been the prelude to a final spurt, aiming high and promising speed. Can that, though, be said of this document? The Liberals and Democrats take the view that it cannot, for it ushers in nothing of the sort. Let me begin, though, by talking about the good things we have found in your programme, like the focus on the reduction of bureaucracy, on the assessment of the costs that legislation will entail, on simplification, in other words the emphasis on better lawmaking – and certainly on less of it; that is a very good thing to aim at, and in that respect we are wholeheartedly behind you. What I want to say for the benefit of those who fear that the EU is turning into a neo-liberal, completely deregulated market economy – and in saying it, I will also highlight Mr Poettering’s spontaneous applause for something Mr Schulz mentioned as an example of what the Grand Coalition is all about – is that those who think the EU is a neo-liberal market economy probably also think that Cuba is a democracy. Now for my second point: you prioritised communication with the public, and that, too, is something we think is a good thing; we are glad that you are doing this, for, if the EU loses its basis and fails to build a citizens’ Europe, then it will not achieve anything worth mentioning either. The EU needs the public as its constant partner in dialogue; it is on them that a single European Union will be founded. If I may turn to the structure of the document – and Mr Schulz should read it more carefully – it differs substantially from last year’s, in that it is clear how the text and its annex fit together, whereas their failure to do so last year was something of which we were critical. We urged to you to make the connection between the two clear, and you have managed to do so, so many thanks for that. It even specifies the legal basis for each legislative initiative, and that, too, makes a great deal of difference – and you provide explanations of them, which makes the whole thing so much more manageable. Why, though, are the existing legal acts, the ones to be continued in 2007, not listed alongside them? Why, too, does the structure not make it even clearer what is about legislation and what is not? Why, then, are you – in essence – changing the picture? Let me add something on the subject of multilingualism. I have heard speculations in this House to the effect – Mr Barroso – that this was your very subtle way of highlighting the possibility of there being too many commissioners, and that this portfolio was intended to show this up in, so to speak, a symbolic way. In the course of this debate, my colleagues will be discussing the various policy areas, energy, climate change and legal policy among them, but I would like to take this opportunity to give you an idea of what overall impact your programme has had on our group. We very definitely see ourselves as having the role of accompanying you in your work in a spirit of constructive criticism, and that, of course, means cooperating with you, but with an emphasis on constructive criticism. We see this programme as a puzzle with many individual pieces, one that cannot really be put together in such a way as to produce a big picture. We cannot find in it any clear policy guidelines, nor any answers; not even attempts at answers to the big questions facing the EU in the shape of enlargement and the constitutional treaty. Nor can we understand why it is that there is not one word in the whole document about humanitarian aid and help with development, areas in which the EU is the biggest player on earth, so why are they not mentioned? Even though your Commission has not achieved much – to put it politely – where the completion of the internal market is concerned, you are carrying on down the same path, and there is no evidence we can see of a holistic and comprehensive approach. Innovation, too – which is quite crucial to Europe, being at the heart of the Lisbon Strategy – is mentioned, so to speak, only in passing and in terms of the European Institute of Technology and the Seventh Research Framework Programme. Our view is that what innovation needs most of all is freedom and the right conditions rather than institutions and more support measures, which tend to take us in the wrong direction. This year’s programme does not, in fact, have a title. Why not, then? It does rather give the impression that not only are the pieces of the puzzle difficult to put together, but also that some of them may well be missing.

 The vote on the report on the discharge of the budget for 2004 (European Parliament) was postponed in order to look into the circumstances surrounding the lease of the Strasbourg building. Subsequently, the European Parliament has paid the City of Strasbourg up to EUR 60 million in additional payments, and there is no possibility of compensation for the losses it has suffered. In addition, a lack of honesty, transparency and decisiveness has been noted. Despite these facts, we should make a decision on purchasing the Strasbourg building. The FDP in the European Parliament is of the opinion that it is wrong for Parliament to purchase the building in Strasbourg, because it would be irresponsible for it to tie itself to Strasbourg for the long term. We have therefore rejected the corresponding amendments. The FDP supports the establishment of the European Technology Institute in Strasbourg, and advocates a single seat for Parliament in Brussels.

 Mr President, the MEPs belonging to the Free Democratic Party have voted against the resolution on the economic and social consequences of business restructuring operations in Europe, being convinced that, in Europe’s market economies, businesses should be free from political pressure in deciding where their production sites should be located. In our single market, competition – including competition between regions – plays a decisive role in terms of the further development of European enterprise and of the way in which it can keep itself fit. The ultimate effect of political pressure is to impede the functioning of the market and it is for that reason that it should not be applied as a means of deterring businesses from acting on their own decisions.

 Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, we have heard a piece of Mr Poettering’s election campaign and an entire speech from Mr Schulz’s election campaign. That is refreshing for this House; and also the idea of turning the Presidency into an electoral campaign is something quite new. However, Mr Schüssel, Mr President-in-Office of the Council, from an artistic point of view your Presidency has been a complete success. There was a Presidential logo – those beautiful ties you are all wearing – and there was music; there were paintings and wonderful dashes of European colour. This aspect of the Presidency really has been very pretty. In sporting terms, too, there have been great successes. You have organised a football tournament in which Austria has not only played, but also won, as I have heard. Congratulations, and I suspect that this really has created more public interest than many a political decision, sad as this may be. The tone of the Austrian Presidency has been calm. You have always made yourselves available to the European Parliament; warm thanks are therefore in order. Recently some important political sagas have been brought to a conclusion: the Interinstitutional Agreement, for example, or the Services Directive. Last week’s summit, however, was unfortunately barely visible. The informal motto almost seemed to be: we will meet up, and no one will notice. From this we may conclude that the European Heads of State or Government need a reality check. The EU has already had a pause for thought for one whole year, and now this is just going to continue. Now there is a timetable for the route map and the period of reflection is to be followed by a period of results. It sounds good, but the sad reality is that no one is listening. The game is blithely continuing: when Europe produces a good policy, national governments proudly take the credit; when a bad policy comes along, they say that Brussels decreed it. The European Heads of State or Government must realise that the Constitutional Treaty – that you, Mr Schüssel, and your colleagues signed in 2004 – cannot enter into force like that. I was therefore glad to hear you say that there was at least a shared view that the substance of the Constitutional Treaty should be retained, but not necessarily the Constitutional Treaty itself in this form. Why then does the Council not just say this openly and clearly, and why does it not direct its ideas and energy into finding out what should be done instead? The Group of the Alliance of Liberals and Democrats for Europe supports a Constitutional Treaty that clearly specifies the division of powers between EU Member States and the European institutions, and that describes the basic rights and values that bind us together. The sooner the Council deals with this reality, the sooner the dialogue with citizens can really begin. In this context I would like to emphasise to you, Mr Schüssel, how very happy we are that you got your own way, so that many Council meetings will now be made accessible to the public. Our group has always fought very hard for this, and during Mr Blair’s Presidency we confronted him very clearly with this wish. Once we even greeted him with placards as he entered this Chamber. He wanted to ignore us, but did not succeed. We welcome it all the more that you have resisted British pressure and that you have enforced the principle that transparency will now prevail - for it is the citizens’ right to see who says what or who decides things in their name. This transparency is an important precondition for trust in the European institutions. (Applause)
 That the Council has not, however, dealt with the European Parliament’s concern – namely the Strasbourg question – this is, to put it bluntly, a disappointment. Using a letter to dismiss this – admittedly very difficult – issue just testifies once again to remoteness from ordinary citizens. It is a clear admission of failure, too, that the two largest groups immediately submit. (Applause)
 The citizens’ initiative www.oneseat.eu continues. In just over four weeks on this website, more than 600 000 Europeans have signed their names and called for just one seat for Parliament. We also regret that there has been no progress on deregulation. The stipulated joint programming, whereby the institutions say together what should be done, has been blocked by the Council – even though it would be a step towards transparency and responsibility. These so-called concordance tables – another piece of EU jargon - have also been blocked by the Council, even though they would show precisely what is to be expected. They would let people know what was decided in Brussels, and what the national governments add on top – a very important step. Europe may have become calmer, but hopefully not too calm, because it must be heard so that the citizens can enter into a dialogue with it.

 Mr President, I would say to the President-in-Office of the Council that, at the end of the Austrian Council Presidency, his country’s government has another chance to rescue the Council from its helplessness, as his country’s Presidency has produced very mixed results so far. I very much welcome the initiative for greater transparency in the decision-making process. As Mr Watson said, the Presidency really has passionate supporters of this in the shape of the Group of the Alliance of Liberals and Democrats for Europe. On the other hand, the irony of the story, in a way, is that 2006, in particular – the European Year of Workers’ Mobility – has seen the adoption of a Services Directive that hinders that very mobility. As regards the Treaty establishing a Constitution for Europe, however, the Council must understand that this Treaty has failed in its present form. If we are really serious about the ubiquitous profession that the focus of European policy must be on the citizen, we cannot simply ignore the ‘no’ in France and the Netherlands, nor can we ignore the fact that other Member States have already announced that they will not be ratifying this Constitutional Treaty. Europe needs a constitution – that much is perfectly clear – and the substance of this Constitutional Treaty is good, but specific proposals must be made for what can be changed. In this context, I was very pleased to read an interview with the boss of the President-in-Office, Wolfgang Schüssel, in the German Bild am Sonntag
 newspaper – for two reasons. Firstly, he said that he supports Germany in the World Cup. I think that is excellent – now we are sure to win. Secondly, however, he took up the proposal to hold a referendum on the Constitutional Treaty on the same day in all the Member States of the EU. I think that is excellent, as such a step would really bring citizens and European institutions closer together. In addition, it would really be a historic event: a constitution that citizens had awarded themselves – that would really be an important Treaty. The President-in-Office said, in all modesty, that there were no epoch-making decisions on the Council’s agenda. Yet if he succeeds in putting the idea of a referendum on the Constitutional Treaty on the same day throughout Europe in front of the other Heads of State or Government and in winning support for it among them, he will be able to say, in all modesty, that he has produced epoch-making decisions. I wish him every success in this.

 Mr President, Madam President-in-Office of the Council, while I would like to endorse what Mrs Neyts-Uyttebroeck said about my group’s stance on Israel’s policy over the past few days, I would also like to respond to what you said about the importance of this transitional stage. It is one in which the EU should send out a clear message highlighting the principles of cooperation, those being renunciation of violence, acceptance of existing agreements and the recognition of Israel’s right to exist. That is incredibly important, and the EU must not distance itself from it in any way. That is why I believe the EU is making a grave mistake in continuing to give the interim government financial support. While the EU should send humanitarian aid to the Palestinian areas and help the people who live in them, it should not be supporting the authorities there, for Hamas has neither acknowledged Israel’s right to exist nor renounced violence, and the message we are sending is a deadly one, in that Hamas has reiterated its view that the EU’s decision to continue sending money is an indication that it accepts its policies, while it is still refusing to negotiate with Israel on the grounds that it does not recognise its legitimacy. The whole object of EU support is the promotion of the peace process, but it is wrong to give financial support to those who seek its downfall. The EU must keep to the course it has set so far and must not abandon financial aid, which is its most important bargaining counter, and it is for that reason that I ask you to take another look at this.

Mr President, Mr President-in-Office, you have many important tasks ahead of you in the next six months. You enumerated these tasks, and most of them relate to our everyday work here. I believe, however, that you have a far more basic task to undertake, namely to rediscover the European identity. If that common identity is not visible, it immediately raises a question: from where does the European Union draw its legitimacy? You must look for answers to the question whether Europe is worthwhile for me or any other individual. Is it politically worthwhile? Is it financially worthwhile? How is Europe actually visible in my everyday life? What shows me that I am a European? This is why you must conduct a public debate. Allow controversial contributions, for I am convinced that those who shut out criticism do more harm to Europe than its critics. At the same time, have the courage to launch unusual initiatives. I must say that I am very impressed by your activities in the arts. You are, after all, in charge of Felix Austria
. You are a team player. You are used to playing a tough game. Half of your ministers are women. So make Europe come alive in people’s minds! That would be a success. (Applause)

 Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, it is perfectly plain from the negotiations on the 2006 budget, and even more so from the debates on the financial perspective, that the way the Council is acting is reminiscent of someone who leaves a restaurant without settling the bill. The Council orders more and more powers for the European Union, while being willing to pay less and less for them. The Council sticks up for the Member States. What the Member States want is for the EU to do more and more with the Common Foreign and Security Policy, to fight terrorism and crime, to subsidise agriculture, to organise policies for the protection of the environment and of consumers, for development aid and much else – the list is endless. It is getting longer, and, as we all know, that costs money – a lot of money. So let me tell the Council that it is time the simple truth dawned on it that more powers cost more money, and fewer powers cost less money. It is irresponsible of the Council to demand more powers while at the same time being less and less willing to spend money. Reforming the way the money is spent would do us all some good.

 Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, we Liberal and Democrats have taken a position on your work programme alongside the conservative Christian Democrats and the Union for Europe of the Nations Group. It is evident from the way we have opted to structure its content that there are tasks to occupy us next year in all policy areas. We congratulate you on the fundamental direction of the work programme, which is aimed at making Europe more competitive, at consistent pursuit of the Lisbon Agenda and at completing the market as a means towards strengthening Europe’s economy – those are the right lines along which to go if Europe is to be made stronger and fitter for globalisation. This policy will also bring Europe closer to its people by making visible what Europe really means for them as individuals. I would, however, also like to make some critical comments. This House is where many political initiatives are started, and the scene of many debates, and we would very much like to see you drawing on our debates as a source for initiatives that eventually bear fruit in legislation. What Europe needs is a single work programme for the various institutions, which would make visible the way in which they work together. The fact is that, at the end of the day, it is we who are the people’s representatives; it is we who take note of what the public in the Member States are talking about and of what they want, and so we ask you to take greater account of this. I also have some critical comments to make about the form of the work programme, which cannot be said to be coherent when it consists of two parts, neither of which has anything to do with the other – an introductory section describing in fine words what Europe is all about, followed by a second part lacking any consistency in either structure or language. A document such as this is comprehensible only to those in the institutions who have to work with it; it is not something with which one can give the public any real idea of what Europe actually intends to do. In exactly the same way, we demand of you that, for every initiative that you take, you also specify the legal basis for it, making it possible to trace precisely whence Europe derives the competence to do something in this particular area. It is also advisable to minimise the number of proposals you make, for it often makes much more sense to concentrate on a few things and then do them well. ‘Better regulation’ is not just about making proposals, but also about implementing them later on. Above all, it must mean implementing them more simply, more quickly and more directly, with priority given to the effects of legislation, which means that greater attention must be given to the costs resulting from it. If it turns out that a piece of legislation will cost too much, and that the costs will outweigh the benefits, then it should be dispensed with. This applies not only to new initiatives, for those that are already going through the system, along with legislation already in force, must also be evaluated in order to determine whether it really is needed or whether it costs too much. Working on the principle that less is often more, we have prepared our own proposals, which I ask the Commissioner to draw on, since it is important that the EU should be clear, comprehensible and on a smaller scale if the public are to know what it is all about.

 Mr President, Mr President of the Commission, Commissioners, the work programme for 2006 is not just any old programme. It must be a programme that makes the EU visible once more to every citizen, and, moreover, visible in a positive light. The EU’s problems with credibility and acceptance may no longer be the stuff of newspaper headlines, but they have, of course, still not gone away, and they can be back on the front pages at any moment. It is because they are far from having been overcome that the challenge for the EU is all the greater: its policies must show the public that it really is worth it. That will be achieved through comprehensible policies that produce results, and the best possible results at that. What that does not mean is producing as much legislation as possible with the maximum impact on the maximum number of people. On the contrary, the big issue for the politics of united Europe must always be about how we can get Europe to the top. That is where the title of the work programme, ‘unlocking Europe’s full potential’, gets it exactly right. I might add that that was the keynote of the Liberals’ election campaign in 2004, and I am glad to see you making use of it. It is for that reason, too, that I am glad that the work programme was put together in cooperation with Parliament’s committees. Putting together a common programme for all the EU institutions is a step in the right direction. The fact is that everything else is fragmentary, and the public no longer regard it as justifiable. The four core areas – to which reference has already been made – are very definitely the right ones. It follows that the claim that this policy is close to the public’s concerns is still very far from being backed up. Neither in structure nor in content, alas, does the work programme meet this requirement of being close to the public; at any rate, it cannot be called better regulation if the two parts presented have nothing whatever to do with one another, so that the programme does not hang together. I would like to highlight a few areas that are of particular importance to us Liberals and Democrats. It is a very good thing that the highest priority is given to the Lisbon agenda; a consistent policy aimed at education, research and growth will create more jobs and thereby make the EU competitive. That does of course involve the realisation of the single market for services, including financial services. It is also important that we should be ambitious in driving forward the reform of agricultural policy by, among other things, reallocating more funds to agricultural research and technology. Where internal security is concerned, we believe that two aspects have to be accorded equal importance, one being the need for security and the other respect for freedom. The fact is that we will be no more secure, nor will terrorism be vanquished, if the freedoms of the EU, against which terrorism is fighting, are themselves curtailed. Europe is an example, unique in the world, of how lasting peace can be established between countries that were formerly enemies. It is also unique in its peaceful export of the market economy, democracy and human rights. Great though this is, if we are to remain successful, it must point us all in one single direction, and, as the question is what that will be, we, as Europe’s legislators, are under an obligation to come up with comprehensible, reliable and prompt answers. That must be part of our workaday lives; it must become our daily labour. Over the coming weeks, with this work programme for 2006, we must set an example of how to do that. Over and above that, though, there must be a single dream to unite us as Europeans. It was Victor Hugo who once said that nothing is more powerful than an idea whose time has come. Europe was such an idea, and it still is one. The work programme can be a stone in the mosaic of this idea, but it must fit into the picture of a Europe that wants to move forwards, and, most of all, to become stronger.

 Mr President, if these statements have indeed been made, we too find them unacceptable, scandalous and dangerous. It is in itself staggering enough for a president to address a conference with the theme of ‘a world without Zionism’ and to express himself in such terms. Such a thing is absolutely unacceptable, and we endorse the motion that it be made the subject of a debate in this House.
 Silvana Koch-Mehrin (ALDE

 Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, it is by money that we show what things are worth to us. A look at the EU Budget, though, gives us the impression – astonishingly enough – that agriculture is some seven times more valuable to us than research and education. Such an outlook is false on two counts, for, if there is something that the EU regards as politically desirable, it should use the budget to provide the groundwork for it, and Europe should be investing in the future rather than subsidising outdated structures. It does make a difference whether, for example, one invests in nanotechnology or guarantees a farmer his income – yes, I know, the CSU is living in another era. That is why it is a good thing that Parliament has increased expenditure on the Lisbon agenda and slashed the tobacco subsidies. We need to carry on further down this road.

 Mr President, in June, Tony Blair shared with this House his ideas about the EU budget of the future, which would have fewer agricultural subsidies and spend more on research and education. I am obliged to him for saying this. Even though this reflected both reality and the way the public feel, it was a bold thing to say, and the reactions of the other Heads of Government are evidence of that. I do ask you, though, to keep to your priorities; they are vital to our future, and when people like Gerhard Schröder criticise, remember that he has been voted out of office and no longer has a mandate to speak for Germany. Today, the MEPs belonging to the Group of the Alliance of Liberals and Democrats for Europe welcomed Tony Blair with placards bidding him ‘make EU laws in public’. In so doing, we are responding to another of his announcements, which was that he intended to make the Council’s sessions open to the public. We ask him to make that announcement, too, reality. Just do it! We are waiting for you. (Applause)

 Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, Europe is in a crisis; we have no constitution, and how the EU is to fund itself in future is anyone’s guess. The institutions of the Community have too much to cope with even with 25 Member States, and the democratic deficit is becoming plain to see. If the EU itself were to seek accession to the European Union, its application would be rejected on the grounds that it was not a democracy. It is under these circumstances that negotiations with Turkey are now to be embarked upon, and, as there is no likelihood of the two sides achieving union in the foreseeable future, they must be judged by the same standards, as of course required by the Copenhagen criteria. The possibility of the negotiations being open-ended as regards outcome and duration must, in the interests of both sides, be guaranteed. Reform is needed on both sides, and the negotiations will present both Turkey and the European Union with a great opportunity to implement it. Thank you, and the Minister for Europe in particular, for your attention.

Ladies and gentlemen, the meeting of the World Economic Forum in Davos was a resounding success. The global elite from the business, political and academic communities made it clear that they are fully aware of their responsibility for the problems in the world and that they are willing to act. Bono, the lead singer of the Irish band U2, summed this up very succinctly: if you want money and if you want help, he said, you must talk to those who can give money and provide help. What makes the Davos meeting so important and so useful is that it brings these very people together. The same cannot necessarily be said of the World Social Forum, and the outcome of the latter, I believe, is also far more open to criticism. It may have surprised the critics to learn that the main topics in Davos were Africa, problems relating to the worldwide growth of poverty, how to shape the globalisation process in such a way that everyone derives some benefit from it and how to bring about fair world trade. We in the Group of the Alliance of Liberals and Democrats for Europe are convinced that free trade is the best development aid. Free trade is what helps countries that want to develop, and free trade is also what motivates developing countries to become increasingly competitive. The EU should lead the way here. In particular, it should put free trade on the agenda, especially in areas where trade barriers still exist, namely areas covered by its agricultural policy. We in the Group of the Alliance of Liberals and Democrats for Europe are also vehemently opposed to the introduction of any global tax on financial transactions. Making ourselves poorer in this way would not help the poor to become richer. It is also illusory to believe that solidarity is fostered by introducing new taxes, in other words by imposing what is tantamount to a financial penalty on those who are actually supposed to help. No, the real way to create solidarity is through a worldwide change in people’s perceptions and, quite simply, through willingness to adopt other measures of assistance. We therefore support the priority given to the issue of debt cancellation and find it an eminently sensible course of action, and we believe that those countries which are moving towards democratisation and which are committed to the introduction of sustainable and free economies should be eligible for full debt cancellation. Such forms of aid, however, will have no long-term impact if they are only one-off gestures. For this reason, let me repeat that free trade is what both the developing and the developed countries need most and what will enable us to progress. If we want world trade to be fairer, our foremost aim should be to make it freer.

 Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, the European Constitution, or Constitutional Treaty, is a better legal basis than any we in the European Union have previously had, and, as it is a good and acceptable compromise, our group really can vote to endorse it. We should regard the European Constitutional Treaty as being, above all, a great chance to construct a shared European identity. That is what we in Europe need: a sense of being ‘us’, a feeling of belonging together, with us all seeing ourselves as Europeans and also Germans, Westphalians from the north of the Rhine, and, in my case, citizens of Cologne – all this made possible by this European Constitutional Treaty. We have written our shared values into this Constitutional Treaty, thereby making this old continent into something of a new world, for the wonderful thing about this Constitutional Treaty is that we are defining in precise terms what holds us together. If this feeling of being ‘us’, this identity, is to come into being, it is quite vital that all Europeans should be able to decide for themselves whether they want this Constitution. That is why we are campaigning for referendums on it in every European country, for although most of the people can now vote on the Constitutional Treaty, not all Europeans can. If the people of Europe are to know, firstly, that this Constitution exists, and secondly, having given it some thought, that they want it, it is vital that they themselves should be asked. We should therefore let people themselves vote and make an effort to ensure that referendums are held in every country. It will not, unfortunately, be possible to organise it so that they are held all on the same day, but, if people themselves are asked, it will in any case enhance their sense of identity, their awareness of being ‘us’.

 Mr Barroso, democracy is not comfortable and nor is this European Parliament in which we sit. You will have noticed that. I am convinced, though, that democracy must be fought for day by day, and that, if we want democracy in Europe, we cannot wait for permission to be given before going into battle for it. So we urge you to prepare yourself; we Liberals and Democrats will be a critical partner over the next few years. We expect you, even now the composition of the Commission has changed, to put people and citizens’ rights first. We also demand that you pursue an economic policy guided quite explicitly by the principles of the market economy and one that takes to heart the truth that you cannot distribute what you have not earned. This will be a policy that requires reforms of the kind that are so very necessary in many Member States, including my own country, and so I ask you to very carefully observe whence criticism of your policies or even of individual Commissioners comes. It may be that it is not so much about the individual; perhaps it originates from that quarter that questions the principles of the market economy and is afraid of liberalism. Mr Barroso, we also hope that you will join with us in a common commitment to bring more democracy into Europe. We – your Commission and us in this House – should be allies against the national defenders of the status quo, who are to be found above all in the Council. For that, it is necessary that you should respect this House not only in extreme situations, and should also see us for what we are – the assembly of Europe’s citizens. As Karl Popper once put it, who rules is not important; what is important is that bad governments should be able to be voted out of office, and on that we take our stand.

 Mr Barroso, I voted for you in July because I believe that you have the potential to be a good President of the Commission. I also voted for you because you made three pledges, namely that there would be more women in this Commission – you have delivered on this; that there would not be any super-Commissioners – you have delivered on this too; and that you would remove Commissioners from their departments, take away their portfolios or discharge them entirely if they did not have the confidence of Parliament. These pledges will once again determine how we vote tomorrow. I would therefore ask you, Mr Barroso, to take this very seriously. I am pleased that you wish to steer a very definite liberal economic course with your Commission. I am also pleased that you are making human rights a matter for decision at the highest level, but Parliament is the assembly that represents the people of Europe. Take the vote seriously; discharge Commissioners who do not have the confidence of Parliament! That is right for Europe and right for democracy. (Applause)

 Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, we are horrified by the terrorist atrocity in Beslan. We abominate and condemn it without reservation. The brutality meted out to children, parents and teachers beggars belief; these terrorists are not freedom fighters, but cynical murderers. Like all Europeans, we MEPs are entitled to ask how this tragedy came to pass, and whether it was unavoidable. Who was it who sowed the seeds of such terrorism, which kills so many of the innocent in such terrible ways, in Beslan and in a Moscow theatre a year ago? Who is actually behind the aircraft crashes in Russia? Questions such as these do nothing to diminish our solidarity with the victims and our horror at the hostage tragedy. There is no simple solution in the war on terrorism, for it goes far beyond the bounds of war as we know it, and is also far more complex than what was known as the Cold War. There are no defined battlefields, the foe is not readily identified, and that is what makes simple answers such as military intervention so ineffective. Terrorists must be hunted down ruthlessly, no question about that, and nobody doubts it, but it is not enough to combat the symptoms; we have to get to the causes of this war. The Russian Government must learn from the catastrophe of Beslan if the vicious circle of violence in Chechnya is to be broken. In this situation, warlike behaviour bars the way to a peaceful and democratic end to the conflict. For as long as the people of Grozny have no hope of a normal life, there will continue to be a perverse incentive for more terrorism. President Putin is playing tough, but he is not taking the tough road that a political solution would be, for his government seems not to believe that a political solution for Chechnya is possible. We are left with the lie of an unwinnable war. This week, President Putin announced amendments to the Russian constitution, effectively removing the elements of democracy from the country’s political system. That is no real war on terrorism, but it is Putin’s – a war on the political diversity that Russia needs so desperately, and his stronger government makes the country no safer. We Liberals and Democrats are convinced that we have the right and the duty, as the representatives of the people of Europe, to speak out on Chechnya and to speak up for democracy and the rule of law. It is not enough to relegate Chechnya to the small print in the margin, and that is why we find it regrettable and deserving of criticism that the Socialist Group and the Group of the conservative Christian Democrats have blocked a resolution of this House on this important subject. We must not take the manipulation of elections and the ongoing violation of human rights lying down. Nowhere in the world can we allow the idea of pre-emptive war on terror to take root, for it leads down a dead end. We believe in the universality of human rights and in the rule of law. If the European Union is to have the genuine partnership with Russia that it seeks, Russia has to be prepared to rethink its policy on Chechnya and find the courage to change tack. (Applause)

 Madam President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, let me start by making it clear that the distribution of food to deprived people is, for me, not at issue in the forthcoming vote on the report by Mr Siekierski, particularly in these difficult economic times. I would therefore also like to make it clear at the outset that it was not easy to find a common line within our Group. I therefore respect the personal decision of any member of the Group to deviate from this and not to support our intended rejection of the report. Why am I unable to support the result of the committee vote as it stands? There are a number of reasons for this, which have absolutely nothing to do with helping deprived people within the European Union in these difficult economic times. On the contrary, amendments tabled by my colleague Mr Busk on behalf of the Group of the Alliance of Liberals and Democrats for Europe, although unfortunately found not to be permissible, were intended to give the existing system a future-oriented foundation. The system in place up to now is an anachronism from the times of agricultural overproduction, which fortunately are now a thing of the past. Due to the successful decoupling of direct payments, the intervention stocks have been constantly decreasing in recent years, with the result that, today, up to 85% of the food has to be purchased on the free market. However, that has altered the fundamental nature of the programme and has resulted in the loss of the agricultural dimension to the programme. Since we are now dealing with a social programme, we need to create an appropriate legal basis for it. In this regard, we share the view of the Council’s legal services that the only possible legal basis in place of Article 37 of the EC Treaty regarding the common agricultural policy is Article 308, as otherwise it would clearly constitute an encroachment on the national competences of the Member States. In view of the impermissible nature of our amendments, the only solution can be a new draft from the European Commission. The Commission should also take to heart the principle of co-financing, as whether or not such programmes are meaningful in the mind of everyone can only be satisfactorily assessed at local level.

Madam President, the agreement on the climate package is a modest result. The EU has set a reduction target of 20% compared with 1990. We have already managed just under half the reduction. The keyword is expansion to the east, where emissions are lower in absolute figures, leaving a reduction target of 12% compared with 1990. The EU should achieve 3% to 4% of the reduction in developing countries, leaving just under 9%. Targets can be missed by up to 5%. That leaves 4%. Normally one should say at this point, good, how lucky, the EU has decided not to export its entire economy to Asia. The compromise is clearly cheaper than the Commission proposal. That allows the German Free Democratic Party (FDP) to agree. Instead, the EU is now playing its own Member States off against each other; as a result of the energy mix, exemption rules and crafty negotiation, some Member States have an advantage over others. We could soon see German energy suppliers generating electricity in Poland rather than in Germany, unless they buy it from the French. The fact that the EU Member States are engaged in such horse-trading leaves little expectation of a global agreement and the question of efficiency of resources also arises. Governments, the Council and the EU Commission are called upon to provide for efficiency both for environmental protection and for the economy and growth.

Mr President, Commissioner, President-in-Office of the Council, ladies and gentlemen, first of all I should like to congratulate Mr Goepel most sincerely on his balanced report. We should not be penalising emergent, competitive structures in agriculture. We in the Committee on Agriculture and Rural Development have therefore rejected the Commission’s proposal on degressivity in this form. We should not be discriminating according to the size of the business in the case of direct payments, otherwise jobs would be jeopardised on a large scale. Furthermore, I would argue that a final phasing-out of the milk quota system in 2015 is still right. In view of rising milk prices on the world’s booming agricultural markets and the associated export opportunities, this system no longer appears up to date. A sensible review of the 2003 reform in this regard must not only offer European farmers dependability and reliability in planning, but also be a further step towards the market-based continuing development of our agricultural system.

Madam President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, I should like to congratulate Mr Tabajdi on his balanced report. I think he has succeeded in pointing out the significance of biogas for a sustainable energy future mix. As an MEP representing Northern Germany, I am aware of the potential of biogas as an important and versatile form of biomass energy produced by agriculture. Germany – and particularly Lower Saxony, where I come from – is a leader as far as biogas plants are concerned. We should not miss the opportunity to develop strict, clear criteria for biogas technology when introducing an EU certification system for biomass fuels. This should apply specifically to imports as well. There should be no extra administrative burdens for our producers, however. Only in this way can concerns about the use of cereals and foodstuffs for biogas production be effectively dispelled, because food production must continue to remain agriculture’s overriding responsibility. Only in this way can and will biogas technology make a meaningful contribution to a secure energy supply, to reducing our dependence on foreign imports, to climate protection and to rural development. European research and development programmes will also then be able to generate greater efficiency.

Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, first let me thank Mrs Thomsen for her balanced report. I would like briefly to outline the key points of the Committee on Agriculture and Rural Development’s opinion. Our committee expressly welcomes the proposed Roadmap for Renewable Energy as an important contribution to the sustainable development of Europe. We need to make more efforts to develop renewable energy sources. On the one hand, Europe has to safeguard its energy supply and reduce its dependence on foreign imports. On the other hand, we must observe our commitments to climate protection. In the energy mix of the future, bio-energy will also have a key role to play in boosting rural employment and the rural economy in Europe. At the same time, the promotion of bio-energy must not lead to distortions of competition. The set-aside rules no longer fit into the system and should be abolished, partly also because of the shortage of agricultural land as a result of the competition between food production and renewable raw materials. In its opinion on Mr Lang’s report on an EU biomass and biofuels strategy, our committee already attached special importance to the introduction of an EU certification system. On the one hand, we must avoid putting additional administrative burdens on our own producers by applying existing regulations, such as the one on cross compliance. On the other hand, biofuels imported from third countries should also be certified according to strict environmental criteria, in order to ensure a positive environmental balance. When we promote biofuels we must not allocate the available resources primarily to research into second-generation biofuels. There is still a considerable need for research into first-generation biofuels. Adequate attention should also be paid in research and development programmes to decentralised means of producing biofuels because of their many advantages.

 Madam President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, I would like to begin by congratulating Mr Langen on his balanced report. As draftsman of the opinion of the Committee on Agriculture on this report, I am pleased to be able to highlight a few points briefly. Bioenergy will be of central importance in the energy mix of the future. In many areas it can and will make an important contribution to the security of energy supply and to reducing our dependence on foreign imports, to climate protection and to employment and the economy in Europe’s rural areas. The Committee on Agriculture considers the introduction of an EU certification system to be particularly important. On the one hand, we must avoid additional administrative burdens for European producers by drawing on existing rules such as cross compliance. At the same time, biofuels imported from third countries should also be certified according to strict ecological criteria to ensure a positive environmental balance. In promoting biofuels, priority should not be given to research into second-generation biofuels when allocating the available resources. There is still a considerable need for research into first-generation fuels.

 Mr President, the MEPs belonging to the Free Democratic Party have voted against the resolution on the economic and social consequences of business restructuring operations in Europe, being convinced that, in Europe’s market economies, businesses should be free from political pressure in deciding where their production sites should be located. In our single market, competition – including competition between regions – plays a decisive role in terms of the further development of European enterprise and of the way in which it can keep itself fit. The ultimate effect of political pressure is to impede the functioning of the market and it is for that reason that it should not be applied as a means of deterring businesses from acting on their own decisions.

 Mr President, Commissioner, rapporteur, ladies and gentlemen, I should like to start by offering my sincere congratulations to Mr Parish on this balanced report, which my group expressly supports. The development of non-food crops offers EU farmers the opportunity of developing new markets, and therefore support and research are vital in this field. The use of renewable raw materials and renewable energy production both represent an enormous potential for European rural areas. I hail from the rural German Land
 of Lower Saxony. For us in Lower Saxony, in particular, bioenergy is vital as an alternative source of income for farmers and foresters. In some fields, especially biogas, for which we have around 430 plants, we are already leading the field in Europe. At this point, I should like to say that I also expressly welcome the Commission’s latest initiatives in this field: the Biomass Action Plan and the Commission Communication on Biofuels. Parliament will renew its efforts with regard to the EU Strategy for Biofuels within the framework of an own-initiative report. The Committee on Agriculture and Rural Development, too, will draw up an opinion on this. As draftsman of this opinion, I shall be glad to be able to build upon the good work accomplished by my colleague Mr Parish.

 Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, let me start by congratulating Mr Duff and Mr Voggenhuber on the even-handedness of their report, and that I am very glad to be able, today, to present to you the opinion of the Committee on Agriculture and Rural Development on it. This House has had a long fight where codecision in agricultural matters is concerned, and the draft constitution’s incorporation of codecision – which goes back to the Treaties of Amsterdam – in the fields of environmental protection, food safety and the protection of consumers is something to be welcomed. Where agricultural policy is concerned, however, the Council of Agriculture Ministers can still disregard the opinions of the European Parliament, since the codecision procedure is not, under the current Treaty, applicable to the common agricultural policy. Although the draft constitution, when considered in the light of the above, held out the prospect of increased democratic legitimacy, in that all decisions on agricultural policy were to be subject to codecision, the Agriculture Committee does believe that the existing text is still in need of some improvements. The objectives of the common agricultural policy, as set out in Article III-227, contradict the goals of the European Union described in Article I-3, and no longer serve any readily explainable purpose. They must, as a matter of urgency, be updated to take account of the multifunctional nature of our present agriculture, which provides work for 10 million people in the EU, is the sole guarantor of the sustainable development of rural areas and cannot be considered in isolation from them. This draft constitution is not equal to the task of creating a CAP that is acceptable to society at large, and so one priority for any future treaty must be to extend codecision to the common agricultural policy, and, in particular, to close the loopholes that remain in Articles III-230 (2) and III-231 (2) of the text as it stands at present. Since the CAP is so very important and occupies a predominant position in the EU’s Budget, the European public have every right to the highest possible degree of transparency and, above all in this sensitive area, codecision – which, as I see it, can mean nothing other than full codecision for the European Parliament on all matters relating to agricultural policy, consumer protection and the safety of food.

 Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, let me start by congratulating Mr Freitas on his balanced report. The outermost regions of the European Union suffer from geographical, climatic and economic conditions that are adverse in comparison with those prevailing in the others, a situation the particularities of which the EU has acknowledged and, indeed, mentioned in Article 299(2) of the European Communities Treaty. It is therefore the EU’s business to ensure that its more distant regions can share in the development of the whole. As agriculture is an important means of support for the economies of the outermost regions, I welcome the Commission’s proposal for a Council regulation on special measures for it. Measures of this kind, formerly provided by programmes going as far back as 1991, are now indispensable to the outermost regions’ development, ensuring on the one hand that these can be supplied with the agricultural products they need for life, while also, on the other, promoting the local production, marketing and processing of such products. By providing for decentralisation and simplified management tools, the Commission proposal ensures a more flexible approach to the EU’s outermost regions, and this is something that I very much welcome, believing as I do that the best solutions to problems are, as a rule, to be found locally, where there is most knowledge of a given region’s particular circumstances. This is the only way in which we will, in the long term, be able to make the outermost regions more competitive, enabling them to make up for lost time and catch up with the rest of the EU, for suspending, on a permanent basis, the rules of the internal market or using money from the Structural Funds cannot be sustainable solutions in the long term.
